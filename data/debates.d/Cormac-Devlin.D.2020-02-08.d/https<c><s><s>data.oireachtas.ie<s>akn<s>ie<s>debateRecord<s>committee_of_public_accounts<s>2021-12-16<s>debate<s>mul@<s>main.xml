          <p eId="para_12">No apologies have been received. I would like to begin by welcoming our members and witnesses to the meeting. Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerks, support staff and I are in the committee room. Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House. This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of where the Parliament has chosen to sit.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and joins us this morning, when we will engage with officials from the Department of Health to examine the 2020 appropriation account, Vote 38 - Health. The Department has also been advised that the committee might wish to examine matters relating to the value for money review of the nursing home support scheme, or fair deal scheme, as well as analysis undertaken by the national paediatric hospital development board on the new children's hospital. Arising from consideration of an item of correspondence at last week's meeting, we also sought information regarding the governance arrangements pertaining to the State expenditure on prescription medicines.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, and by Mr. Kevin Colman, Mr. John O'Grady and Ms Fiona Larthwell, principal officers. We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Jim Deane, principal officer in the health Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. They are all very welcome. </p>
          <p eId="para_15"> When we begin to engage, I would ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback. As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or switched off. Before we start, I wish to explain some of the limitations of parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references that our witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege. However, one of today's witnesses is giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts. As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present on campus. That witness has already been advised and they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> Witnesses should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Members are reminded of the provision in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objective of such policies. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> To assist our broadcast and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness. If the question is not being directed to a specific witness, I would ask each witness to state their name when they first contribute. I am mindful of the fact that we are online and there is sometimes a delay. I do not want to interrupt anyone but if I have to intervene, I ask members and witnesses to comply with that and ensure we are not talking over each other. I ask members and witnesses to be mindful that it is a little more difficult to run a meeting remotely than when we are all physically present in a committee room. I ask them for their co-operation in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> I now call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">The appropriation account for Vote 38 - Health records gross expenditure of €20.8 billion in 2020. This represented a 19% increase on the gross expenditure of €17.5 billion incurred in 2019. The majority of the gross expenditure in 2020, amounting to just under €20.5 billion, was paid to the HSE. This was spread across 14 subheads in the account. Other subheads of the Vote provide for payments of grants and other support to bodies under the aegis of the Department and funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund and Sláintecare initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> Receipts into the Vote in 2020 totalled €488 million. These comprise mainly €270 million recovered in respect of the cost of providing health services to EU nationals under EU regulations, and receipts of €168 million from the proceeds of excise duties on tobacco products.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> At year end, net expenditure under the Vote was €120 million less than provided for. With the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, €68 million in unspent capital allocations was carried over for spending in 2021. The remainder of the surplus for the year, €52 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer. I issued a clear audit opinion for the appropriation account.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">I wish good morning to the Chairman and members of the committee. It is good to join them this morning. I have a brief statement, as the Chairman mentioned. As Accounting Officer for the Department of Health’s Vote 38, I am pleased to be here today to discuss the 2020 annual report and appropriation account of the Comptroller and Auditor General. I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Kevin Colman and Mr. John O’Grady, from the resources division, and Ms Fiona Larthwell from the social care division in my Department. I will now set out the main points of the 2020 accounts as they pertain to Vote 38.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"><i>
						</i>The initial 2020 net provision, current and capital, for Vote 38 was €17.9 billion, which consisted of a gross provision of €18.3 billion and appropriationsinaid of €430 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">As the scale of the challenge presented by Covid19 became clear, it was evident that unprecedented action was needed here to prevent the spread of the disease, high rates of hospitalisation and intensive care unit admissions, and significant mortality. New structures and processes were put in place between the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE to facilitate timely decisionmaking while also ensuring that high levels of governance were maintained, where the HSE reported to the Department each week on the estimated Covid19 related noncapital and capital expenditure that had been incurred to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Additional funding of €1.997 billion was voted to the Department in a Revised Estimate in June 2020 to support the measures outlined in the national action plan on Covid19. This represented the expenditure approved by the Government for Covid19 measures taken up to the date of the passing of the Revised Estimate. A further net Supplementary Estimate of €514.5 million was approved to meet additional funding requirements that arose to the end of 2020. As the Comptroller and Auditor General stated, this resulted in a net overall provision for Vote 38 of €20.44 billion, incorporating a deferred capital surrender of €30 million carried over from the previous year. The 2020 outturn was €20.3 billion, leaving an overall surplus of €120 million. The Department of Health received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry forward €68.2 million of unspent allocations in respect of the capital elements of subhead M2 into 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> As members are aware, the pandemic has been an extremely difficult time for frontline employees and workers in the health service. They have responded with diligence, resilience, agility and a level of commitment that has been extraordinary. With the support of the Department and the Government, the HSE has introduced new capabilities and innovations across the system. These include implementing eprescribing in general practice and introducing alternative care pathways and new models of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> An example of the innovation of the health system was seen in responding to Covid19 last year. New testing and contact tracing capability was implemented, with the delivery of 720,000 GP referrals, 2.3 million laboratory tests and more than 440,000 contact tracing calls during the year. We have implemented a hugely successful Covid19 vaccination strategy with one of the highest levels of uptake in Europe and we are making very strong progress in delivering booster vaccines across the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Further investment in the overall reform of the health system includes very significant investments in clinical strategies such as the cancer, gynaecological and maternity strategy, coupled with an unprecedented investment to address the shortcomings identified by the 2018 capacity review that has seen us deliver the largest increase in acute and critical care beds and in community beds in decades. Allied to increasing acute capacity, we are undertaking a critical shift left in moving care out of acute settings and into the community, with the recruitment of an additional workforce of more than 3,000 staff to implement community care networks across every community in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> The Department has continued to successfully discharge its other functions. Importantly, we seek to frame policies and legislation to promote health. The life expectancy in Ireland is now estimated at 82.8 years, which is above the EU average of 81 years. However, with the prevalence of preventable noncommunicable diseases, it is important to promote healthy behaviours and prevent ill health. Under the Healthy Ireland umbrella, which is a Government of Ireland initiative, we work crosssectorally to achieve this objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> We also support the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Ministers of State in their work, including their legislative priorities and their public and parliamentary accountability. For example, in 2020, the Department processed more than 9,224 parliamentary questions, representing 24%, or almost one quarter, of all parliamentary questions tabled to Ministers across the entire government system.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> The Department continues to enhance its governance and performance oversight in respect of the services and reform being delivered by the HSE. In line with Sláintecare, legislation was enacted in 2019 to introduce new accountability structures in the HSE, with the formal appointment of a non-executive and competencybased governing board. In recognition of these new structures, the Department put in place a revised engagement model with the HSE and its board with a view to strengthening the oversight of governance and performance management and accountability of the HSE. This oversight model is operational and will continue to be improved and enhanced as necessary to ensure there is more effective oversight within the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> This improvement work continues. The Government has committed to bringing forward regional health areas. A business plan for the implementation of regional health areas been developed by the Department. The HSE has provided feedback and implementation considerations on this business plan. A memorandum for Government on the next steps for implementation is being drafted. I anticipate the Minister will bring the memorandum to Government for decision in January 2022. To ensure we have front-line and expert input as we move forward, the Minister established an advisory group. Given this progress, the Minister has informed the hospital group boards that they are being stood down this month as their terms of office expire. There are many reforms and improvements taking place that are providing better healthcare to citizens. Together with our colleagues in the HSE, we are focused on further reforms in 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> Finally, I thank the staff in the Department of Health for their ongoing commitment and dedication to our work programme across many dimensions of our work. I look forward to continuing to work with the committee and with the Oireachtas and am happy to take any questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">I will direct my questions to Mr. Watt. I want to touch first on the issue of the national children’s hospital. In July, an official of his Department told the committee categorically that costings of €2 billion for the hospital had not been considered but, three weeks ago, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform refused to rule out the figure of €2 billion. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has provided an estimate in excess of €2 billion. Has Mr. Watt considered such a figure to date? Is it referenced in the report that he has and that the committee has requested?</p>

          <p eId="para_38">I thank the Deputy for her question. We have provided very detailed notes and briefing on this matter. I know the committee has considered it several times. We have set out clearly what we think the estimate is for the hospital and the related satellite and integration works. We have also identified that there is a significant risk, given the delay in the project. It is delayed, as the Deputy is aware, likely into 2024 now, and that will increase the costs of the project. There are ongoing issues in respect of construction inflation. There will be further claims relating to contract stipulations in the context of inflation above 4.5% in 2019. There are ongoing claims and disputes between the contractor and the board. There is uncertainty in respect of what the final figure is. We have set that out. We do not at this stage have any update on the figure we have put in the public domain, but there is heightened risk in respect of that estimate for the reasons I set out in the note that I forwarded to the committee and which we outlined before.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">As we have stated previously, we are not speculating. We do not think there is any benefit in us speculating at this stage on what the estimate of the final figure will be. We know there are pressures and we have stated that repeatedly. I understand there is a legitimate request for certainty in respect of the costs from the committee in terms of discharging its role to have a latest view on whether there will be a cost increase but, against that, we have to manage the interests of the State and the taxpayer and that is why we are-----</p>

          <p eId="para_96">The Taoiseach has said that in a response to me, but obviously that is no addition whatsoever because they are leaving in their droves. Given that 80% of the population who hold medical cards have not been able to access dental treatment for at least the past six months, what is the Department of Health doing about it? That €10 million is not cutting it at all because they are leaving in their droves and they are not coming back. When can people with medical cards access dental treatment? When will this issue be resolved? The Department does not seem to be applying any priority to it at all. In any other country it would be staggering if 80% of the people entitled to dental treatment under the medical card scheme could not access the treatment for almost a year. When will that be resolved?</p>

          <p eId="para_105">I am not sure if there is any point talking further about the children's hospital. I put it to Mr. Watt that people on this committee are well aware of the complex and live contract involved and that it is a multi-strand process. Everyone on the committee and indeed the public understand there are escalating construction and material costs at the moment and that the contract is subject to claims. It is very unsatisfactory for Mr. Watt to say today that "discussion of costs by officials, however hypothetical or otherwise at this time, may prejudice enforcement of the existing contract, and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise the Development Board in its ongoing engagement with the main contractor". Ultimately that statement presents itself less as a discussion of the complexity of a contract and more as an attempt to constrain, control or remove the public oversight of this project. Nobody likes to talk about spiralling costs, but oversight of public spending is a fundamental principle of public life. It is not Mr. Watt's role to act as gatekeeper. It is completely valid for the Committee of Public Accounts to ask these questions. We should have access to that report.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">I am not refusing to answer any questions. I have appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts and the health committee previously on this for a whole day. Our colleagues have appeared many times to discuss the children's hospital. I do not think it is a fair characterisation to say we are not willing to answer questions on it. We have done so repeatedly. I am very happy to do it today again if the Deputy wishes. I am happy to discuss the costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> The different factors that have increased the cost of this hospital are well known. The risks that now relate to finishing out this contract relate to inflation. There is a provision within the contract for paying an amount above the prescribed 4.5% that is in the contract. There are delays in the contract that will of necessity push out the cost because it will need to be managed for a further period.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> Then there is the issue of claims. I sent a note to the committee setting out the detail of the claims, the scale of the claims, some settlement of the claims that have taken place and so on. It is our judgment and it is not a clear decision absolutely as to what is the right or wrong decision but there is a trade-off here between providing detailed information on our assessment of what the likely outcome of the settlement of these disputes will be-----</p>

His words in the statement today were that "discussion of costs by officials, however hypothetical ... could negatively impact or jeopardise ... ongoing engagement".

          <p eId="para_117">Let us stay on capital expenditure and governance. I ask Mr. Watt to outline the oversight. His opening statement mentions hospital group boards being stood down and advisory groups. It is to be hoped we are in the process of moving to regional areas with Sláintecare. What oversight does the Department have on capital expenditure regarding both existing capital assets and new projects? This week the health committee dealt with the closure of the Owenacurra centre in Midleton. This decision seems to have been made entirely by the local agency in direct contravention of Government policy in A Vision for Change because it will leave east Cork with no mental health places.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> There seems to be almost no oversight from the Department. It is some person in a room making a decision and they seem to be a law unto themselves. There is no comeback and no possibility to change it even though it is in breach of Government policy. Why is there so little oversight from the Department on decisions like that where a building is allowed to be run down to the state it is in? How does that fit into this new model that is being described to us?</p>

          <p eId="para_119">On the regional health areas and the hospital groups, as the Deputy is aware, that is related to proposed reforms in terms of improved integrated care, integration of the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and the hospital groups. It is the reform plan that has been set out. We are now developing an implementation plan. As part of the implementation of this, the boards of the hospital groups are being stood down. We decided not to replace them because a number of members were due to leave and we had to replenish the membership. It was decided to stand down the groups, in effect, in preparation for the new structures we and the HSE are working on to deliver a key aspect of Sláintecare.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">Regarding oversight of capital, we agree the overall capital budget. Every year, discussions take place between our Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, there is a decision on the allocation, and a view is reached on what capital projects can be delivered, which is set out within the national service plan and the letter of determination the Minister shares with the HSE. The HSE is then provided with delegated sanction to deliver projects in line with that mandate. The Department-----</p>

          <p eId="para_125">The problem is the question of suitability, if applied to most residential mental health facilities, would lead to a tsunami of closures throughout the country. In that light, why the HSE picked this particular building to close is a mystery to everyone, including the families being left behind by the decision. I understand Mr. Watt will not have had sight of or information on this case, but where the HSE has made a decision on the removal of services that relate to a capital asset and that decision is in breach of policy and does not have good reasons behind it, what recourse does the Department have?</p>

          <p eId="para_133">I have taken a very quick look at the report. One set of figures relating to 2019 shows that the average cost per patient per week in a public nursing home was €1,616 while the cost in a private nursing home was €992 per week. That is a 62% difference. Someone referred to additional costs being imposed on patients in private nursing homes, but is this not a sizeable disparity between the cost of providing care in a public nursing home compared with a private one? There is a criticism of private nursing homes in terms of additional charges and their low pay rates, but if it is costing €1,616 per week in public nursing homes, is there not an argument to be made that there is significant disparity in the level of support being provided as well as discrimination in real terms?</p>

          <p eId="para_137">The costs are lower. This review was carried out in 2019 since when costs have increased substantially. The private nursing homes are not able to carry the costs and, therefore, are imposing them on the patients. There is a great deal of justified criticism to the effect that the homes are not entitled to do that. On the other hand, the Department has sat on this report for a long time. When is the review of the funding that should be provided under the fair deal scheme to give people in private nursing homes a level of care that compares favourably with public nursing homes?</p>

The latter shows a significant cost differential. Most of it appears to be accounted for by staffing. There are two issues in that regard, namely, the overall pay costs per grade and the different mix of staff. Within the public system, there are more nurses and fewer healthcare assistants whereas the private system tends to employ more healthcare assistants relative to nurses. The overall-----</p>

          <p eId="para_150">The point I am making Deputy, and this is what we are trying to establish with the review, is whether there is evidence to suggest that the care needs of residents in various settings differ and, if they are the same, how are the costs different? It is not a question necessarily of us saying we are not providing enough support for the private settings; we are asking why is there such a large differential. Ultimately, the State is picking up the tab across all settings. Generally, with regard to the fair deal scheme, the allocation is €1.4 billion. That is taxpayers' money. Some 23,000 to 24,000 people benefit from the scheme. There is an enormous challenge in terms of its sustainability and how that relates to home care supports.</p>

          <p eId="para_171">On the nursing home scheme, in fairness to Deputy Burke and the other members of the committee, that report was commenced in 2018 and, as I understand it, was due to be published in March 2019. I do not expect Mr. Watt to respond in respect of what happened back then because he has only been in his role in the Department since this time last year. The committee completed a report on the fair deal scheme and its recommendations were accepted by the Department in full. That was 11 months ago. The point made by Deputy Burke is that this report was published by the Department at 9 o’clock last night. Can Mr. Watt understand the frustration felt by the Deputy and other members at the committee at being treated in that way? We make recommendations that were accepted in full and 11 months later we still had not got the report but, hey presto, the night before the meeting, when everybody had left, the report came through. I am saying this to Mr. Watt as Chairman of the committee. To me, that seems like bad practice and to be a smart alec manner in which to treat this committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">I totally dispute that accusation. I find that very disappointing. Officials in the Department are working incredibly hard on this issue, and on the report produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the report produced by the NTPF and the report produced by Tom Ferris. There is also the nursing home expert working group on Covid-19. All those reports cover more or less the same ground. We have implemented the vast majority of the recommendations in those reports. I think I sent the Chairman a note this week setting out once again our response to the vast majority of those. There is one issue about a report, which, I accept, we should have published earlier, but the committee should acknowledge the significant response to these reports that have been set out. This issue is very important. In response to Deputy Burke's earlier comments, the value for money report sets out, in more granular detail, what we broadly know already in terms of this differential. We are committed to working further in terms of what that might mean with respect to the pricing of any supports. The officials in the Department are working on this. They are doing many things. They have responded quite proactively to the recommendations of those various reports.</p>

Since then the Department has been refusing to speculate, as Mr. Watt put it, and that has lead to fears the costs will be substantially more. The figure of €2 billion has been set out. Does he recognise there is a failure on the part of the Department to be transparent, which means it is difficult for this committee to meet its obligations with regard to accountability when we do not have and are not being provided with that information?</p>

The point I have made very clearly with regard to this report is that it contains commercially sensitive information that, were it to be in the public domain, would undermine our ability to deal with these disputes, which involve very significant sums of money.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">Do I accept that? There is a serious debate to be had on this, which we have had before at this committee and the Joint Committee on Health. The normal contract we go with is a fixed-price contract. It was decided in 2015 or 2016 that that type of contract would not have led to any bidders for this project and that a two-stage process, where works were undertaken and as those works were being done, design would be finalised and we would go from a draft stage to more a more complete design and then tender for the project, would be followed. Mistakes were made in the implementation of that, which we set out previously around how that was operationalised.

          <p eId="para_230">I welcome our witnesses. It is good to engage again following our previous engagement in July.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> I will stay on the children's hospital and follow up on some of my questions in July. It is clear that we will not get a copy of the report. To an extent, I appreciate why not. When the committee visited the site, it was clear there were all sorts of claims, some of which were legitimate in theory because the design of the project had changed. I can appreciate that. However, Mr. Watt must realise that we, as the Committee on Public Accounts, are very interested, as I am sure he and other Secretaries General, as to what the final cost will be. As I have said previously, this is an essential project. We are in, whether we like it or not. We need a new state-of-the-art children's hospital. However, the Committee on Public Accounts would like to know even a guesstimate of costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Regardless of what the report states, it would be helpful to give a ballpark figure to this committee, and ultimately to the public, to say how much the project may cost, subject to legal fees and other charges. Will Mr. Watt give an indication of what percentage of the project is complete?</p>

Those views are legitimate on both sides. We have a legitimate view here, which is not in any way about stifling the committee or not being supportive of transparency. It is just a different view about advancing the State's interests. Can the Deputy remind me of the question?</p>

          <p eId="para_256">That would be helpful. Analysis was done by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board. In an email to the committee, I note that Mr. Watt stated that the analysis was not in relation to the progress of the national paediatric hospital but it related to forecasting of critical paths and scenarios for the optimal completion of the project. What exactly does Mr. Watt mean by that? Is that in relation to the completion of the overall project or to the actual construction of the project, or both?</p>

          <p eId="para_259">The big challenge within the project is to ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to the project. That is something on which the board and the contractor continually engage. There are more than 1,000 people working on the site now and the members probably saw the activity when they were there. It is to ensure the project is adequately resourced to deliver on the type of timeframe. Second, it is to get to a better place in terms of the dispute resolution. At the moment there is more positive engagement in terms of disputes. We are trying to engage more positively, to expedite the claims and get through things faster. These are the two things that stuck out, along with the obvious complexity of the project. This project is four times bigger than the most recent hospital built in the State, which was Tallaght hospital. This is an absolutely enormous site and when one actually gets involved and looks at the complexity of the project it is incredibly complex.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">I have other questions but I will not get the time on them, so I will turn to the legal costs for the Department. With regard to the MDU refusal, there are departmental legal costs in excess of €1.6 million, which is extraordinary. Is that the Medical Defence Union? That case has been rumbling on for quite some time. What has been going on for longer, and is quite frightening from my perspective, are the legal costs for the Department in the thalidomide case. Is that the case that has been going on since 2010? I am conscious that there are only a handful of survivors left of this case. These are the second ever largest legal costs for the Department, as were stated in the 2020 accounts. Will Mr. Watt please clarify both of those items?</p>

          <p eId="para_263">I will get to the situation regarding the thalidomide case in a moment. The MDU is the Medical Defence Union. As the Deputy will recall, as the market for indemnity collapsed, particularly for maternity services, the State stepped in and provided the clinical indemnity scheme, which in effect is managed by the State Claims Agency in order that cover is provided. Cover was provided by the Medical Defence Union in advance of that scheme. There are various legacy cases that still have to be addressed. Because the income to the Medical Defence Union fell away as practitioners moved to the State claims scheme, the MDU did not have the future income to deal with the liabilities it had incurred or was accruing on foot of cases that predated the establishment of the State scheme.

          <p eId="para_277">I do not know. I was on the other side, in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I recall, from my perspective over there, the engagement between Paul Reid and the Department of Health on the procurement. Obviously, it was done very quickly in difficult circumstances. We were trying to access PPE, which was in short supply, and we needed to get it quickly to protect people. The procurement of that was a challenge. From my perspective in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we were trying to ensure we had proper sanctions and reporting and that, where possible, we were complying. I cannot say exactly what role my predecessor, Jim Breslin, played <i>vis-à-vis</i> the HSE, but I imagine he and the finance team were involved with the HSE, because the sums were so enormous, to work through exactly how we would go about that. The HSE was taking the lead, but the Department would have been supportive of what it was doing.</p>

From a departmental oversight perspective, how is the Department linking in with the efficiency with which that is being done, the supervision of any wastage and the overall costs? Clearly, the priority is to get the vaccines to people as quickly as possible, but is this an ongoing management issue or matter for supervision?</p>

          <p eId="para_279">Yes, pretty much. It probably has occupied most of our time in the past week. At the weekend, I and members of the management team in the Department spent most of our time on the booster campaign, looking at what implications there would be for the health system if people were to be moved out to the vaccination centres and how we could access staff from other parts of the public service. Colleagues have been engaging with GPs and pharmacies on what more could be done, how we can galvanise more and how we can get supplies. There are issues around the 15-minute waiver, which the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, acted on yesterday with the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC. There are a whole variety of issues the Department is dealing with. A group meets every Monday at 2 o'clock, where Paul Reid, the Minister for Health, I and other colleagues are involved. Given the concerns about the new variant, a key part of our response and our protection is to ensure we get as many boosters out there as possible within the next few weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">In feedback, pharmacists have told me this morning that they were contacted yesterday by a new relationship manager in the HSE to do precisely that and to get vaccines out. On foot of that, they were advised they would be able to vaccinate people over the age of 18, so they ordered many more vaccination doses. I am thinking of one pharmacy in Blackrock that ordered an additional 800, obviously at a cost, and was then told later in the afternoon that the vaccinations were restricted to the over-50s. I am sure this is just a management issue that can be ironed out, but all these things add up in terms of both urgency and cost. That is just feedback I thought I might highlight with Mr. Watt while I have the opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> A couple of weeks ago, representatives of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, appeared before the committee, along with representatives of the State Claims Agency. One issue on which we are following up as a committee, and I think the Comptroller and Auditor General is too, relates to the clinical indemnity scheme, which Mr. Watt mentioned earlier. What is the relationship between the Department of Health and the State Claims Agency in respect of payments by the latter? Much of this is rooted in health, incident management supervision and so on. Will Mr. Watt talk us through that?</p>

          <p eId="para_282">The biggest element of the State Claims Agency relates to medical negligence and a smaller subset accounts for the most significant costs. When there is a case, the State Claims Agency manages the day-to-day case, decides the strategy and recommends a course of action. When it comes to feedback on what we can do to reduce the incidence of cases of negligence and harm, it is about patient safety, incident management and different ways we respond. A patient safety office has been established and we have new protocols in respect of incidents and a new approach for how we engage with people who have suffered from an incident. The Department's role is to get feedback from the State Claims Agency in terms of its understanding of what is going on, and then to look at the policy response and whether we can do things differently to reduce the number of claims and to manage the claims process in a more efficient way. The number of claims is unsustainable for the State. The amount of money we are paying out is incredible and it must have gone up by more than 100% over the past ten years. It is incredible, so-----</p>

          <p eId="para_300">Yes, I think almost 40 have been built since 2018. It is a very significant improvement in the capacity of the system to treat people closer to home within the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">There has been an increase in home help hours. We touched upon this earlier. The home help supports budget has increased by €150 million compared with last year, a very significant increase. I refer to all the various elements, including increasing capacity and improving care for people near the community. We touched earlier on the regional health areas, which we are working on, and other aspects. There is significant progress. Yesterday we had a meeting of the new Sláintecare implementation board, the new structure we have set up. We looked at plans for waiting lists, regional health authorities, enhanced community care and the Sláintecare integration fund. We looked at the largest projects at our meeting yesterday.</p>

          <p eId="para_374">It is very clear that we are going to have to ask representatives of the Department of Health to come back because most of our deliberations today are around the issue of the national children's hospital, as opposed to some of the other issues in the Department of Health that require scrutiny, of which there are many. I, too, want to start with the issue of the national children's hospital. I was present at the meeting of the committee in January 2017, when members of the NPHDB were in. The figures were discussed. The projected cost had gone from €983 million to €1.433 billion for the building of the project, and to €1.7 billion when the fit-out was taken into account. On that day, we got a one-page breakdown of how the costs changed between 2017 and 2018. As I recall, we looked for it and it was dragged out of the people who were there. Reading from the report that was given to us that day by members of the board, there are two sentences that I want to reference, in particular:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_375">The February 2017 figure was €983 million, which was the approved business case. The project was tendered on a two stage basis. The bill of quantities for the first stage was based on a partially developed design. The second stage included involvement of contractors with designers in finalising the design and confirming the actual quantity of materials. This included a targeted schedule of €66 million value for money savings ... The November 2018 figure of €1.433 billion is the cost to completion in 2022 based on a completed and fully developed design. All risks on quantities, programme, omissions, co-ordination and ground conditions are now transferred to contractors. </p>
          <p eId="para_376">We now know that the hospital will not be delivered for a further two years. There are building costs for a further two years. Are those costs on top of what was included in that €1.433 billion? Building inflation was very low going into 2018. We are now in a very serious position in respect of building inflation. That will add to the costs of this hospital. More than €4.5 million in inflation is built into the contract. Were any penalty clauses built into the contract? Contracts have two sides to them. The obligation on the part of the contractor was to build the hospital by 2022, which it did not do. Part of that was because there was not a sufficient number of builders on-site or oversight. Does the Secretary General accept that the figure of €1.433 billion is the cost to completion in 2022? If it is not being delivered until 2024, does he also accept that it is going to cost more by virtue of the fact that it is going to take two years longer? Is there the prospect of a counterclaim with the contractor who had an obligation to deliver the hospital by 2022 being looked at? It is what the contractor signed up for.</p>

          <p eId="para_377">There can be a counterclaim if there is a breach of contract. I am not involved in the day-to-day details of the contract, so members of the NPHDB are probably best placed to answer those questions. For there to be a counterclaim, one must demonstrate that there has been a breach of contract, and that the delay is due to contractual failure as opposed to external factors. I presume the contractor will argue that external factors have impacted upon its ability to deliver the contract.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">We know that during lockdown last year, there were months when construction on the hospital was not recommenced. No work was done. We know that there was an inadequate number of staff on the site and that caused delays initially. Is that part of the obligation on the contractor? The more we go into this, the more building inflation is going to be an issue. It is part of the reason the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Oireachtas on Health want to keep a close watch on this to keep costs down - not to put it out into the public arena to drive costs up. That is where we are coming from. I do not feel that is accepted.</p>

          <p eId="para_380">I believe there is a real possibility of a counterclaim here for non-delivery within the timeframe. A slippage of two years is really serious. The previous Secretary General at the Department of Health made a commitment to provide this document to the committee when it was due. I think it was due at the end of last year. Mr. Watts subsequently joined the Department and suddenly, the attitude changed to providing a copy of the document to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health. Was the change of Secretary General material to that change in attitude? Who is advising Mr. Watt on what should happen in this matter, or is he the final arbiter?</p>

          <p eId="para_390">I think I set them out earlier on. I had done that before in my previous role. There are issues with the final design. A decision was taken to move on this when it was understood that there was a final design. In actual fact, the design was not final. We know now that many of the specifications were not correct. That has led to significant cost escalations. Mistakes were made. While the two-stage process was the right approach to adopt, errors were made in how it was implemented, particularly in relation to in making the decision, which was understood to be on the basis of a final design. It was the case that the design was not complete at that stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">I confirm that I am within the Leinster House complex. It is important to have the Secretary General in the committee. As part of my contribution I want to acknowledge the enormous work that has been done by many of our healthcare professionals around the country that are under the remit of the work of the Department. That needs to be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> A number of important issues across many different areas have been brought up with Mr. Watt today, but I want to focus on one particular area. The Department has one of the biggest budgetary allocations of any Department in the State. One concern that I have, and it is important that we look at it in the year ahead, is around staffing within the organisation, particularly in the context of front-line medical professionals. In terms of attracting staff and getting value for public money, which is important, is Mr. Watt satisfied with the current salaries within the HSE system for doctors, nurses and consultants in general? Does he think it needs a degree of analysis of where we currently stand in that particular area, in order to prevent the exodus of skilled working professionals who are going to places like Canada and Australia? This is common for many people in my age group. I want to ask Mr. Watt this from the outset.</p>
        </speech>

          <from> Mr. Robert Watt<recordedTime time="2021-12-16T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_403">There are now 131,000 full-time equivalents in the health system. That figure is up about 10,000 since the beginning of 2020. There is significant recruitment taking place and net increases in staff. Within that, there are people who have left for a variety of reasons. Those may be for the reasons that the Deputy mentioned - they may be leaving to work in other places for better opportunities, better employment or better salaries. Overall, however, the system is able to recruit more staff and to provide better services.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> Consistently, of course, there are gaps. We would have liked to have done more recruitment this year than we were able to do. There are gaps in many different areas. I am sure the Deputy is familiar with the areas where there are gaps and staff shortages. The question of salary can be an issue, depending on the area and on the sector. There are other issues involved around working conditions, the physical environment, the hours people are expected to work and so on. There is a variety of different issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> Pay is constantly kept under review. It is under ongoing review as part of the overall pay agreement. The HSE, as a big employer, is always looking at trends in the workforce, the number of applicants for jobs and the ability to attract people. It is an ongoing concern. Certainly, into the future, as we try to recruit more people, we need to train our own people and provide them with more opportunities. We are providing more opportunities for people to go into medicine, nursing and all the different areas. The number of available college places has increased again for this September. There are plans to increase it further. There is a wide range of issues. Salary can be an issue and we keep a close eye on it as part of an ongoing review.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">We need to explore this further. There needs to be proper analysis done on why young graduates often feel that they need to leave the country. We are seeing in places like Canada and Australia that opportunities are being presented to young graduates who have studied here. The State has gone through the enormous cost of supporting their education and higher education. There is no disputing that. However, I feel we need to look at this.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> Like many public representatives and indeed the public, I question the overall strength of the public healthcare system in this country, considering the level of investment and the billions upon billions of capital going into this area. I would like to see the Department undertake a body of work that involves a deep-rooted analysis of why this happening. It should get into the universities and talk to people who are nearing the completion of their higher education before they start work in our hospitals and the healthcare system. I feel there is a necessity to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> We have seen throughout the pandemic that so much strain has been put on the health system in general. ICU capacity has been increased from 200 to 300 beds. We want that figure to increase further to give us scope to prevent us going back into lockdown situations and scenarios with new challenges that may arise as a result of the pandemic. An enormous level of urgency is needed in this area. Could the Department look at this?</p>

          <p eId="para_409">I agree with the Deputy. There are areas in the health system which are challenged, and there are challenging roles. </p>
          <p eId="para_410">He mentioned ICUs where the Government has increased the number of beds and has plans to increase them further next year, which is really critical and important. Our big challenge is to get trained ICU staff, particularly nursing staff, of which I understand there is a short supply around the world. There are many different elements here. It is about salary, training and working conditions. There is also an element that people will want to go and live in Canada, Australia and other places for a period. That is part of what many people want to do when they graduate. That is the reality of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> The key thing for us, however, is to ensure that we are attractive so that people come back. The majority of people who go away for a few years come back and then find employment in the health system. There is an ongoing challenge to make the jobs attractive, however. Pay is one aspect of it but it is really about the opportunity to learn and the physical environment in which people work in terms of the general atmosphere. If people are working in an environment where they are under strain all the time, which has been the situation for large parts of the health system for the past two years, that is a very difficult environment to have to face every day. We all hear the stories of the enormous effort people have put in and will have to put in even more in the next few months to deal with the challenges that will probably be coming down the tracks. In terms of what we can do as a Department, I will certainly take that back and reflect upon it.</p>

          <p eId="para_413"> Is Mr. Watt in any position to inform us about the healthcare sector in Ireland, particularly the area of nursing? This has been repeatedly brought up to me by many people who are nursing. One would not expect that perhaps two thirds of the way into their careers, many of them are actively considering quitting. Does Mr. Watt feel this is an area into which the Department needs to put an effort around reviewing working hours? He acknowledged conditions and there is obviously a cost to the State. We are losing these highly-skilled workers who have a role to play. Many of them came back into play to give their country that service when it came to the pandemic, which was greatly appreciated. The point has to be made, however. Will that issue be analysed by the Department in the short- to medium-term future?</p>

          <p eId="para_417"> One other point of concern is that we have all seen what has happened with the children's hospital. It has been extraordinarily disappointing and frustrating. It has definitely been a turning point for many regarding overruns on State projects and putting in the necessary safeguards.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> In my region, outside of my constituency but well within the catchment area of services that are being provided, we are looking at the potential for a new elective hospital to be built in County Cork.

          <p eId="para_419">There are plans with regard to three elective hospitals in counties Cork, Dublin and Galway that will have the capacity to do between 900,000 and 1 million procedures in a given year, which will take enormous pressure of the existing acute system and provide much better care.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have put in place new procedures now for capital projects with reviews of different gates and different stages in the approval processes as they are going through. The new elective hospitals will be part of that and so on. Obviously, the big issue is about the actual procurement model and the two-stage approach that was used for the children's hospital. I do not think that will be used for the electives. It will be different. In many ways, the elective hospitals are not as complex. They have a significant footprint, particularly the one proposed for Dublin, but I do not believe they are as complex as the children's hospital. There is a new approach to try to avoid the unsatisfactory situation that developed with the children's hospital and the costs associated with that.</p>

What safeguards will be placed in the contracts to analyse and go through them in detail whereby, for example, one year into a multi-year build, which many of these types of projects are, it can be said that serious issues are very clearly arising and come up with some type of resolution process with the contractor or contractors that will be appointed for those building projects?</p>

There are so many different aspects to it that we are always going to be delivering Sláintecare. It might be called something else but we have made progress on much of it.

          <p eId="para_432"> The key thing is that significant progress is being made. There are plans particularly for next year because of the funding that is available. The Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform announced very significant funding in the budget for the health system. That will mean an increase in core spending of more than €1 billion. That will enable us to recruit more staff, enhance community care, increase the number of beds, advance the digital projects we are doing and all the different aspects of that, improve universal care by extending free GP care to six and seven-year-olds and take other steps.

          <p eId="para_436">I do not think one can separate out spending to improve capacity within the system and the number of people employed in community settings or improvements in GP settings. I do not think one can separate improvements to the overall health budget and say they are Sláintecare because in effect, I see now the overall reforms and enhancements. Over the past number of years, I believe €2 billion to €3 billion has ultimately been allocated to measures that could be labelled as "Sláintecare". Some of the aspects of Sláintecare include enhanced public capacity. I mentioned the increase in staffing in reply to Deputy O'Connor's question. We have increased the staffing very dramatically. Much of that is Sláintecare-related. We increased the number of ICU beds by 800. These are all aspects around enhancing capacity. Then, there are some of the eGovernment initiatives. It is something we can reflect upon and come back to because the question of how much we are actually going to earmark for it is an interesting one.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">Obviously, there are different aspects to the waiting lists. There is the outpatient waiting list where there are over 600,000 people now waiting. There is the inpatient and day-care waiting list, where there are 75,000 people who are waiting. We have had a structural problem with waiting lists. We were making some progress before Covid.

          <p eId="para_440">I will rephrase my question. As of 30 November, we had 897,000 people on some form of public hospital waiting list. That figure was published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, last Friday. What will be done to reduce waiting lists in the coming years? What does the Department envisage to be an acceptable level?</p>

          <p eId="para_441">I do not think people waiting beyond a certain time is acceptable at all. People waiting for longer than ten or 12 weeks for an outpatient procedure is not acceptable. I do not think that there is any acceptable waiting beyond a certain period. There will always be people who have to wait a few weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> It is interesting when one looks at the numbers. There are over 600,000 people or outpatient consultations. In 2019, the last year before Covid, there were 3.5 million outpatient consultations, so there is a number of those 600,000 who are waiting too long. Thankfully, many of them will be seen quickly. There is about 200,000, I think, who have been waiting for more than six months out of a total of 3.5 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> In terms of inpatient day cases, IPDC, there are about 1.3 million procedures a year. There are 75,000 people waiting and there are about 30,000 people-----</p>

          <p eId="para_445">Just let me finish the point. The people who are waiting too long probably account for about 5% or 6% of the overall delivery in any given year. The question then is how can we increase capacity and activity to ensure that people are not waiting longer than ten or 12 weeks. That involves an enhancement of capacity. Against the enhancement of capacity, there are more people every year incoming and flowing on to the list looking for care. This is primarily, but not exclusively, because of the demographic changes and demographic structure in society. There are, therefore, a number of different challenges. How can we increase productivity and activity in the public system and how can we access the private system to get more activity because the private system has volume and capacity which we can access? That is a real challenge for us.</p>

Obviously, Covid impacted upon that. For 2022, the Government has allocated €150 million for the NTPF so that will increase the number of procedures it is able to purchase in the private system.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> We also have the Safetynet procedures, which are about critical time dependent care and is non-NTPF. A lot of people are being treated in private hospitals. Last week, we occupied 1,800 beds in a given week. A significant number of people are now getting procedures, thankfully, with that. The plan is to extend Safetynet for the period ahead, particularly if we are dealing with another surge in the hospital system and increase that.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">The smaller projects are equally as important. Locally, I have been given a timeline of 2026 for the expansion of the emergency department at Mayo University Hospital. I would love to review the HSE's capital and estates programme to see what level of resources are provided for these types of projects. It is unacceptable that it will be five years before anyone in Mayo University Hospital will get access to an additional emergency department. While it is great to get funding of €8.4 million approved, it is the delivery of the project that is causing a huge issue. Ultimately, it will be reported back to the Minister but if the HSE's capital and estates team are not accountable, this falls down. I have an issue with that.

          <p eId="para_462">As I mentioned, the HSE is responsible for delivering on the projects. There are many different projects and many projects have been delivered. I cannot comment on the project in Mayo to which the Deputy referred. I do not know the details. The reality of building any project is that there is a delay and it takes a number of years. We are always focused on trying to accelerate project delivery because it is not satisfactory. It takes time, however, from conception and design to procurement and then actual delivery. It depends on scale. The challenge for society in terms of how quickly it takes us to build public projects is a wider issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul McAuliffe<recordedTime time="2021-12-16T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_463">I will continue on the point Deputy Dillon made about the transparency and oversight of the delivery of projects. Mr. Watt may not be familiar with the Finglas primary care centre project and he can revert to me with an update in writing. We know how important primary care is in the area and the HSE has done significant preparatory work on the site. Unfortunately, the project has been dogged by planning delays and other issues. As with Deputy Dillon, who I am sure will advocate for capital projects in his area, I ask that the Department ensure the primary care centre in Finglas, an area of real need with a very low number of GPs in some parts, is delivered to the community so that we can tackle not just the GP waiting lists and related issues but also provide for more holistic healthcare.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I had to attend DDoc with my son in the Coolock primary care centre last week. I was quite envious of the facility it has. I am sure Mr. Watt does not have project details in front of him at the moment, but if he could take that on board, I would appreciate it.</p>

          <p eId="para_465">As I mentioned earlier, 38 new primary care centres have been delivered since 2018. I am familiar with the one in Coolock and one in Ballybough too. They are fantastic facilities. As the Deputy will appreciate, I am not in a position of influence here, when lobbying on behalf of Finglas primary care centre, which I am sure has great merit, or Deputy Dillon's project. We will come back to the Deputy about it. I have seen it on a schedule. It is to be hoped we can get it up and running. It is critical to have the infrastructure to provide a proper space for the different teams I mentioned earlier, including the community networks, the community intervention teams, the teams for chronic disease management and the teams for older people. I know that part of the city well. The demographics are such that many demands are placed on the system as that generation moves on.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> Deputy Dillon asked about Sláintecare. An important aspect of what we are trying to do is to provide that care in the community, including home care supports, to ensure people do not have to go to emergency departments and can get out of the hospital system as quickly as they can, because many people should not be in these acute settings.</p>

          <p eId="para_467">As I say, it is a case that makes itself. I turn to the registration of births and deaths. While it is primarily a HSE function, is the Department of Health concerned about the significant delays that appear to be emerging as a result of Covid and the cyberattack? There are delays in Dublin of up to 11 or 12 weeks for people registering births and deaths. That has a significant knock-on impact on people's ability to avail of State services. It could be a matter of getting access to a local general practitioner, processing probate, or applying for a passport. Deputies from Dublin all see significant delays. I ask Mr. Watt to expand on the solutions to it. Is the Department concerned about or aware of it? Has it captured the delays and the number of people impacted?</p>

          <p eId="para_468">I understand it can create a problem for people, especially when managing estates and probate. I am aware there is an issue with delays. I do not know anything about it. I guess that it is partly Covid related. I do not know why that is or what we might do about it. I will find out and come back to the Deputy. I guess the situation is a function of the challenges the system faces. Regarding births, do people have to register the child in person? Is it done in person? I do not know enough of the detail. Let me look into it.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">I am not aware of the issue in any detail and so cannot say anything meaningful to the Deputy. If there is a delay, that will have the impacts the Deputy has mentioned, which could be quite serious for individuals and families. I will look at it and come back. I can see the difficulties a delay would lead to but I do not fully understand the cause of the delay. There might be a plan in place to deal with it in the HSE.

          <p eId="para_471">Mr. Watt is not alone. I believe 11,000 people are caught in this situation. Many who contact my office are not aware of why it is happening. We all understand the cyberattack had a crippling impact on the HSE's ability to administer data and its IT systems. The idea that private companies are now making services available to register services outside of Dublin is a concern. They are providing that service to people in Dublin at a cost above what the State charges so that they can effectively queue in an office outside Dublin which has lower demand. That is a significant failure of the State. I appreciate it is a delegated function of the HSE. I ask Mr. Watt to take from this meeting the idea that we need to examine what is happening here. The Department needs to set targets for when the HSE should have deaths and births registered. When it falls below them, there should be penalties. I imagine, from what Mr. Watt is saying, there is no specific service level agreement for this area. Are any specific targets set? Does the Department give the HSE any specific measurements regarding the administration of this function?</p>

          <p eId="para_472">I am sure there are targets. I would be amazed if there are not targets with a commitment to register within a certain timeframe. I imagine that is part of the agreement or understanding between the parties involved. I will check that. We are not doing well enough at the moment. I do not know the reasons or what action might be taken. In the normal course of events, there would be a commitment to do it within a certain timeframe, so I imagine there is a service level agreement or target. Whether that is explicitly written down or understood, I am sure it exists. I will come back to the Deputy with an update.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">I would appreciate it if Mr. Watt could provide specific written correspondence on that. A number of Deputies and Senators have concerns about it. There is emotional trauma when people try to register a parent's death, have to go in again and again, and are unable to do so each time. There is also a practical impact. My concern is especially about early years and the registration for child benefit. The Department needs to examine it. It needs to make sure the HSE's difficulties are resolved. If private companies are able to offer a service where they can get a birth certificate in another HSE office elsewhere in the country, then the HSE should be able to link those two things together and ensure people can avail of the additional resources that seem to be available within the current system, whether online or in person. I appreciate Mr. Watt does not have the information in front of him. I would appreciate a written response on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">Returning to the matter of the children's hospital, we have established a few things. One is that we are about 60% of the way through the project's financial costs. Some €873 million will have been drawn down by the end of the year by the contractor. Mr. Watt mentioned the €1.43 billion that was budgeted and that we are now at a figure of €1.7 billion as time has moved on, with increased costs due to construction cost inflation. In the figures that Mr. Watt gave, the hospital is to be completed at the end of 2024. That is in three years. At a rate of 4.5% inflation in construction, which is probably conservative, it will cost approximately €250 million extra due to inflation alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Then there are the claims on top of that. Regarding the total claims between now and completion of the contract, Mr. Watt is obviously going to say this is commercially sensitive, but is the figure in the region of hundreds of millions or tens of millions of euro? </p>

If the price level continues to go up, I am not sure exactly how that formula works but I can get back to the committee on that. It also relates to a part of the contract but does not relate to all of it. The materials element would be one part of it, wages are another part of it and so on.

          <p eId="para_510">Leaving that aside, what I am interested in and what this committee is interested in is whether there is a penalty clause built into the contract covering delays on the part of the contractor. I ask Mr. Watt to come back to us with clarification on that because it is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> We visited the site back in June, which was informative. We learned about the number of claims and what they were for, as well as about changes, some of which were very last minute. I know that everything cannot be foreseen, particularly on a big project but there were a huge number of claims, some of which were for very small things such as moving a window or changing a partition, for example. I asked the person from the board and the contractor to show me examples of what the claims were about. I was struck by the claims. Another issue that struck me was related to energy usage. I asked what provision was made to harvest any energy generated on site and whether there would be solar panels. I was told there was no room for solar panels. We were standing on top of the building, looking across the area at this point. We were looking down on terraces of houses that have gable ends of about 6 m or 7 m by 5 or 6 m across. We were looking at two-up, two-down and three-bedroom semi-detached houses, an awful lot of which were covered in solar panels but we were standing on a new building and were told that there would be no solar panels on it and no energy harvested from such panels. Again, I know Mr. Watt came in after the contract was signed and the work commenced but am I correct that none of this was built into the contract? </p>
          <p eId="para_512"> I am sure the hospital will be put into a very glossy portfolio by the architects involved in its design. It is one of those "wow" projects, for want of a better word. This is an amazing design of an amazing building and there is nothing like it anywhere in the State. However, in terms of maintenance, it will take an army of window cleaners alone to keep the windows clean. What is the annual estimated cost for maintenance and what is the situation regarding energy usage? I hope that some thought was given to this before it was signed off by the Department and the Minister. Can Mr. Watt give me an answer on the issues of energy usage and overall maintenance on an annual basis?</p>

          <p eId="para_515">I do not know the energy usage of the building and I do not know about the other issue but I can come back to the committee on it. The Chairman has asked three questions about the claims <i>vis-à-vis</i> the design changes. There are disputes, as there tends to be in contracts, around whether claims are due to the fact that the design may have changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Of course, that will be disputed and there will be issues around that.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> The second issue mentioned was energy usage. I am sure it is an energy-efficient building that is built to the highest possible specifications. The footprint is massive. It is four times the size of Tallaght Hospital, so I am sure there will be significant maintenance costs involved. I will come back to you, Chairman, on the specific questions on energy usage and maintenance.</p>

          <p eId="para_518">I have one other quick question. In relation to pharma companies, is there any funding, benefit-in-kind, sponsorship or money for research for any particular projects that may transfer to healthcare professionals, healthcare facilities, hospitals or any entity working in the public system? We spend in the region of €2.3 billion a year on drugs. It is a substantial amount of money. A number of other European countries and the USA have regulations in place to govern the situation. Mr. Watt will be aware that a number of companies are buying up GP practices, so they could have ten or 20. We do know that we have a high prescription rate of drugs. I am not medically qualified to say whether that is right or wrong but, apparently, compared to other countries we do dish them out fairly plentifully. We do not have any way of tracking that. I wish to raise the concern that people may be receiving more medication than they need or more expensive medication than is necessary. I acknowledge that we have made progress over the years. It is not that long ago that a standard antibiotic was approximately €28 and now we can get it for €8 or €9. I acknowledge the work that has been done by the Department in that regard. Has Mr. Watt discussed with his colleagues or with the Minister the need to bring in regulations to ensure transparency so that if anyone working in the public system or entities attached to the public system or working within it are receiving any benefit, financial or otherwise, or benefit-in-kind from a pharma company, that the information is put on a register.</p>

          <p eId="para_519">You raise a fundamental question, Chair. First, based on prescription patterns, an awful lot of drugs are prescribed. I have the number of 60 million prescriptions a year in the GMS system in this country in my head. I do not know if that encompasses drugs under the refund scheme as well, but the figure may encompass both. There is a very significant level of prescription and it is a worry if it is inappropriate prescribing. The overall cost now is very expensive at €2.5 billion and it is increasing by 5.5% a year, which is not sustainable. The cost is not sustainable and the level of drugs being taken is an issue as well. We negotiated a deal with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, which the Government will sign off soon for an enhanced scheme to reduce the price, but we need to push ahead with more prescribing of generic, off-patent drugs, biosimilars and so on. There is a big job of work to do in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> You also raise an interesting question, Chair. Public health officials who work in the public system cannot receive any hospitality or supports from anybody beyond a certain level covered by the ethics legislation. GPs are not public servants, even though a lot of their income is funded by the public system. I do not know whether the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, or other bodies have ethics guidelines to ensure that people are not unduly influenced when it comes to their prescribing patterns, but I imagine it is not an issue. It is a good point.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">The question is whether there has been discussion at senior level in the Department or with the Minister regarding those who have contracts with the public service or entities within the public service on whether they are receiving benefits, financial or otherwise, or benefit-in-kind from a drugs company. Is Mr. Watt aware of whether there has been a discussion in that regard – "Yes" or "No" – on the public registration of that?</p>

          <p eId="para_522">I do not know. I have not had a discussion with the Minister and neither have colleagues. The point I make is that public servants are not allowed to receive benefit-in-kind or gifts above a certain level under existing ethics legislation. It they do, they have to disclose it. I think the limit is €350. Any public servant receiving any benefit-in-kind from a pharmaceutical company would have to declare that anyway. That would be declared and registered. As I understand it, GPs are not public servants, even though they benefit significantly from the public purse.</p>

          <p eId="para_568"> On Mr. Watt's unilateral decision to refuse the committee access to the report, even in a confidential manner, the board of the national children's hospital had said it was looking forward to discussing the report and its contents with the committee. If we were to invite representatives of the board in the new year, would Mr. Watt block them from discussing the report's contents, just as he has refused to furnish us with the report?</p>

          <p eId="para_577"> The second question concerns plans by the Department for the introduction of a Covid vaccine compensation scheme. Has the Department made a decision on that? The Government published the Meenan report in December 2020 and one recommendation of that report was that a compensation scheme be established. I seek Mr. Watt's thoughts on that.</p>

The total cost for the three years is about €500 million. I will write to the committee with the exact numbers. We pay some of it in advance but most is paid on delivery.

          <p eId="para_582">We have procured, I think from memory, about 25,000 doses of the antiviral drugs. It is not that expensive. I will check and we will come back with the exact details. We and other member states have pre-purchased them from Pfizer as part of the European Union deal. We will come back on exactly what the vaccine spend is to date and prospectively. It is evolving in terms of the uptake. We will also come back on the antivirals.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">On the vaccination and booster programmes, I compliment the staff who organised and delivered the first and second vaccination programmes. I had the first dose in May and the second in July. I queued for the booster dose on Sunday morning. It was a long queue and I spent a few hours there but it shows there is a huge demand for it. I acknowledge the tremendous work of the front-line staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> There has been talk that there is not a great demand and we may have vaccines to spare. I have two questions on that. First, have any vaccines passed their best-before date? Hopefully, those we cannot use or are surplus are sent to the developing countries that need them. Second, is there a serious plan to ramp it up? I think there is a huge demand for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_585">I thank the Chair for those comments. It is not just the front-line workers but also the staff doing the negotiations, administrative staff and all the people in the Department of Health and the HSE, front-line and non-front-line, who are involved in this. It has been an incredible public health endeavour, considering the amount of vaccine administered.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> We are doing everything we can to ensure there is no wastage. We are donating any doses we have which might be going out of date to other countries. There is always some wastage at a local level. It is always possible but is being kept to a minimum. Everything is being done to ensure the supply we need is used and, if there is surplus, it is donated to other countries. That is the policy but I do not think there has been significant wastage of deliveries received.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">We have, however, diverted prospective deliveries that were due to come to Ireland to other countries, particularly in the lull after the end of the main second vaccination programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> Deputy Dillon asked about vaccination compensation. I have not yet addressed that question. It is something the Department has committed to doing. We will have to look at that.</p>

          <p eId="para_590">Absolutely. Deputy Munster asked about the dental issue.

          <p eId="para_591">I thank our witnesses - Mr. Watt and his team from the Department of Health and the staff member from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - for their work in preparing for the meeting and for attending. I am conscious that the Department of Health has faced unprecedented challenges for the best part of two years. We are probably facing into another difficult year. It is to be hoped that we can get through it. I acknowledge the work of the staff. All members mentioned the front-line staff. I also mentioned the administrative staff and everyone else behind that. I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, and his staff for their attendance and assistance throughout the year. This is the final meeting of the year and, on behalf of the committee, I thank the secretariat. It is dangerous to mention names because I will leave some of them out, but I thank Sarah, Eoin, Pat, Sam and Shane for the service they have provided. I also thank Martin, the clerk to the committee. I wish the staff of the health service all the best for Christmas and the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> Is it agreed to request that the clerk seek any follow-up information and carry out any actions arising from today's meeting, of which there are a few? The meeting was fairly robust and there were a lot of questions. I know Mr. Watt does not have all the information to hand. It is agreed that the clerk will follow up and, as always, the Department will supply that information to the committee. That is agreed. Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statement and the briefings provided to the committee for this meeting? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> We will suspend until 1.30 p.m., when the committee will resume in public session to consider correspondence and other matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">The public business before us comprises the minutes, accounts and financial statements, correspondence, work programme and any other business. We will then go into private session before adjourning. The first item is the minutes of our meeting of 9 December. The minutes were circulated to members. Do any members wish to raise any matters regarding the minutes? No. Are the minutes agreed? Agreed. As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> The second item is accounts and financial statements. Four financial statements and accounts were laid before the Dáil between 6 and 10 December 2021. They should be on the screen now. I will ask Mr. McCarthy to address the accounts and financial statements before opening the floor to members.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_510">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2021-12-16T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_596">As the Chairman said, there are four sets of financial statements to deal with. The first relates to University College Cork. Those are the 2019-20 financial statements. I have given a qualified audit opinion for those statements. The university recognises an asset in respect of deferred pension funding and that is standard practice for universities. I do not normally qualify in such circumstances. However, in this case, the amount of the asset that is recognised includes €11.1 million in respect of liabilities relating to professional added years for transferred in service. There is an agreement between the university and the Higher Education Authority that the expenses relating to the professional added years for transferred in service would be split on a 50:50 basis, but the university is over-recognising by €3.8 million in respect of that. In my view, that is not in accordance with the agreement and, therefore, I have qualified the audit opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> I also draw attention to significant non-compliance with procurement rules by the university. More detail in that regard is given in the fees statement on internal control. </p>
          <p eId="para_598"> The second set of financial statements relates to the Oberstown Children Detention Campus. Those are the financial statements for 2020 and I have given a clear audit opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> The third relates to the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo. These financial statements relate to the year of account 2017. ReBo finished its restructuring operations in July 2017 and it was intended that the board would be dissolved at that stage. However, the dissolution had to be done by way of new legislation and that Act was only passed in 2020. I gave a clear audit opinion but there was a very significant delay in the finalisation of the 2017 financial statements. The reason for that was that the board, in 2017, did not keep adequate accounting records. It failed to correctly record and explain the transactions for the year and, therefore, we were unable to carry out an audit of the financial statements. There was engagement with the Department of Finance, where the board is now housed. In 2021, the board appointed external accounting expertise to investigate and rectify the accounting records. Once that was done, we were able to complete the audit. </p>
          <p eId="para_600"> There are a number of further periods of account that we have now proceeded to audit with very few transactions. I hope we will be able to do those fairly promptly. As it stands, the board continues in existence until we have completed that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> The accounts of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland for 2020 have been presented. I gave those a clear audit opinion.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">On ReBo, I presume Mr. McCarthy will come back to us sometime next year. I presume it will be reported as an audit at that stage. Until that happens, there is little we can surmise from what Mr. McCarthy has given us to date. Am I right in that understanding?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_513">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2021-12-16T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_604">The number of transactions after 2017 will be very small. There was a total of fees for collection of approximately €1.6 million. That is the extent of the funds that are involved. ReBo was using the credit union fund to carry out the restructuring so the expenses on this account are purely the administrative expenses of the restructuring board itself. I hope we will get the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial statements audited pretty quickly in the new year. Each of those will come through as we do them. It should be the case that 2021 and a few months of 2022 will be the final period of account. The Deputy could certainly call the Department of Finance and the board members to discuss this matter if she wished.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2021-12-16T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_605">I have another point relating to University College Cork. The previous Committee of Public Accounts had a number of hearings with universities and third level institutions. There were very high levels of non-compliance or unorthodox transactions and so on. In actual fact, there was a "RTÉ Investigates" report on the issue. It is hugely disappointing to see that pattern still there among some of the universities. That gives us an indication that this is an area we need to look at again next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_606">Okay. Is everyone else happy? We will note the statements and accounts. Is that agreed? Agreed. As usual, the list of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes. I thank Mr. McCarthy.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> We move on to the next item on our agenda, namely, correspondence. As previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion at this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated and the decisions taken by the committee concerning the correspondence will be recorded in the minutes and published on the committee's web page. Six items of correspondence have been flagged under category B, namely, correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_608"> No. 953B is correspondence from Ms Vivienne Flood, head of public affairs, RTÉ, dated 3 December 2021, and is a response providing further information requested by the committee concerning the employment status of contractors who have worked with RTÉ. In that regard, the correspondence refers to the Eversheds review, stating that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_609">Contrary to claims that RTÉ has been operating as a "bogus employer", arising from this review, we have addressed the employment status of any individual deemed to have characteristics akin to employment. We have therefore taken a proactive and comprehensive approach to dealing with residual issues due to practices which occurred in the past. Since 2019, RTÉ has implemented significant reform in this area, and has adopted an "employment first" principal.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The correspondence continues by stating that because the Department of Social Protection audit process is ongoing, RTÉ cannot provide high-level data such as the numbers of personnel involved, categorisation of individuals, income levels etc. As the Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection previously informed the committee, the audit could take well over another year and will assess the employment specifics of the contractual relationships of some 500 individuals with RTÉ. It is therefore a significant investigation. The correspondence from RTÉ concludes by stating that it “cannot provide any further details as to these reviews, which are either ongoing or pending, either in correspondence, or in committee session, until their conclusion.” Is it agreed that we note and publish this item? Agreed. I have flagged this item for discussion, along with Deputies Catherine Murphy and Munster. I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2021-12-16T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_611">Individuals are telling me little progress has been made on things like pensions, holiday entitlements, etc. It appears that RTÉ is prioritising the engagement with Revenue and the Department of Social Protection. That aspect is disappointing. It is important that we know what is happening in this context because we want practical changes. Representatives of RTÉ are telling us that there have been changes, but other people are telling us that it is not happening in reality. That is disappointing.</p>

          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2021-12-16T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_612">I do not think Deputy Munster is with us yet. Regarding the inquiry taking more than a year, that is fair enough. It is a substantial undertaking in that it is addressing the contractual relationship of approximately 500 contractors, as RTÉ terms them. The issue concerns what is happening regarding those people who have been reclassified and what their situation is now in respect of having proper PRSI credits paid for them for the years during which they were wrongly classified in that regard and any other benefits they would have been due if they had been categorised as PAYE workers during that time. We will require an update on those aspects. Representatives from RTÉ are due in with us in our first sitting in January 2022, so we will look for that information then. Is everybody else happy with that item? Okay.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> No. 957 is correspondence from Mr. Martin Whelan, head of public affairs and communications, National Treasury Management Agency, dated 6 December 2021, which provides further information as requested by the committee regarding the State Claims Agency, SCA. It includes responses to requests for information in relation to the outstanding financial liability in respect of cell sanitation in the Irish Prison Service; the outstanding financial liability in respect of An Garda Síochána active claims; and a progress update on open disclosure and any engagement the SCA is having with the legal profession to encourage mediated settlements, as opposed to court settlements. Is it agreed that we note and publish this item? Agreed. The only comment I have regarding this correspondence is that there are a considerable number of claims in this context. There are 2,399 active claims against the Prison Service and many of those probably concern cell sanitation. We should keep an eye on this matter because it involves a significant number of people and a certain amount of money. In addition, 150 staff members and 47 members of the public are also involved in those claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> No. 959B is from Mr. Jim Breslin, Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, dated 6 December 2021, and provides information requested by the committee regarding capital funding being withheld from the University of Limerick, UL. This arises from a matter we examined when we engaged with representatives of UL in June, namely the acquisition by the university of a site in Limerick city centre in 2019. It will be recalled that this concerns the old Dunnes Stores site. The Secretary General states that the funding has been withheld "pending assurances from [UL] in relation to capital management procedures". Several questions regarding this matter remained unanswered when we raised it with the representatives of UL, who stated that the matter was the subject of a review by KPMG. I propose that we note and publish this item and request a progress update from UL on the KPMG report. Our last update from UL on the matter was on 21 October 2021, in correspondence referenced as R0842. Is that agreed? Agreed. This item was flagged for discussion by Deputy Carthy.</p>

          <p eId="para_618">I thank Deputy Carthy. We might have got this before, but, if not, could we request KPMG's terms of reference for the conduct of that inquiry and the details of who drew them up. The fourth paragraph down piqued my interest, which referred to the total grant amount calculated for UL for 2021-22 as being €2.4 million. Of that, some €757,000 was approved for release in August to support time-sensitive payments relating to additional places and ICT supports for disadvantaged students, with a decision on the balance of those funds pending. I wonder if one aspect relates to the other. It does seem like the institution is on a short leash. For that reason, I would put this matter in with what we have heard about the audit in University College Cork. There is an issue with both these institutions. The concern for us in this regard is when we will have representatives from both institutions in before the committee. We will want to see that report from KPMG in advance of speaking to witnesses from the two universities, but it does seem to be the case that the Department is keeping a close eye on things in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">The last paragraph of the letter referred to the report of the review being undertaken of the purchase of the site in Limerick having not yet been finalised. It continued by stating that the governing authority of the university had confirmed that it will act to address any issues, findings or recommendations highlighted by the review in due course. I suggest that we follow up this matter after today's meeting and that we seek a copy of that report from the Department as soon as it is finalised.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">The next item is No. 966, from Mr. John Dollard, chief superintendent of An Garda Síochána, dated 8 December, providing information requested by the committee regarding media reports of an official strike action by senior officers and its impacts on investigations by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC. We will not publish this item because the information has been provided on a confidential basis and because it concerns an industrial relations dispute. The chief superintendent states that the matter is being progressed through all available dispute resolution processes, including the industrial relations machinery of the State. I ask members to bear in mind this is an industrial relations issues and that they should respect the confidential nature of the information. This item was flagged by Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy.</p>

          <p eId="para_627">I was looking for clarification, in the first instance, as to whether we have written to GSOC as well on this matter. The length of time, at the best of times, that GSOC investigations take can be quite frustrating for those who are dealing with the system. Separately, can we get confirmation GSOC is on our work plan for next year? It would be useful if we had it appear before the committee.</p>

I refer not to the totality of the core duties of the Garda but to those that relate to GSOC. We should write to the Department of Justice as well to see if there is any conflict with legislation relating to GSOC.

          <p eId="para_641"> The next item is our work programme. On 25 November, we agreed we would agree to the work programme for early in the new year. The updated schedule has been circulated to members. On 20 January, we will engage with RTÉ and representatives of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media - that is some Department - which provides RTÉ with State funding. The secretariat will work to schedule an engagement with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, for 27 January, and on 3 February, we plan to engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA. We will also invite representatives from the Department of Transport to attend those meetings. Members have requested that those meetings would run one after the other because of the close relationship between the bodies. On 10 November, we planned to engage with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and National Broadband Ireland to examine expenditure on the national broadband plan. We will continue to revisit the work programme each week. Do members wish to raise any matters relating to the work programme?</p>

          <p eId="para_642">Is there a reason we must deal separately with National Broadband Ireland and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications? The timeframe for putting specific questions to each body will be very limited. If it is the case we will deal with each body separately, I propose that we waive the correspondence meeting in the afternoon and have National Broadband Ireland for the full session, beginning at 9.30 a.m., and the Department for the full session in the afternoon, and hold any correspondence over until the following week. It would be a short timeframe within which to deal with any organisation. We had difficulties when we tried to hold meetings under two hours. If we were to give ourselves even less time, I do not think we would get to the crux of what are a series of important issues that have come to light in recent weeks with regard to the national broadband plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">In the case of National Broadband Ireland and the Department, we will be dealing with a single item. I agree it is a substantial item, and it will be up to the committee to agree to how it wants to handle this. Perhaps it cannot be done in that timeframe. I am open to suggestions on that. I will open the floor to other members. It is one we are all interested in.</p>

          <p eId="para_645">I want to be fair to the Deputies who are not attending this meeting. In previous discussions, there was particular interest in TII and a number of specific issues relating to it. The same is true of the NTA, in the area of public transport and related matters, where there is rail, bus and a range of other areas. I do not think we should rush it or try to compress it into one meeting to make way for a double-header with National Broadband Ireland and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.</p>

          <p eId="para_646">Okay. Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned that we will probably invite the Department of Heath back in, and that might be sooner rather than later, given that today's meeting was dominated by the national children's hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_647">I support the point made by Deputy Carthy about a one-day meeting. I think it will be more coherent if we do it that way, although I agree it should be done in two separate groups because there is an oversight aspect in respect of the Department, which we have to drill into. As for TII and the NTA, they both operate in the area of public transport but have separate remits.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">There was a significant overrun in respect of the Sallins bypass and there are deficiencies in what was produced. The local authority is the ultimate body in that regard. My concern is that we will not capture some of the projects where there are problems. There will be no shortage of material for both of those. We should be considering both of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> As regards health and the national paediatric hospital, we absolutely have to put that back on the agenda for some point in the first half of next year. Health representatives, whether from the HSE or the Department, would normally appear a few times a year before the committee. We did not get into much of the Vote at all. It was mainly the pent-up questions we had on the children's hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> A matter that is probably more for Mr. McCarthy is that of the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the site on Military Road in particular. I continue to have serious concerns in respect of that site and the selection process for the site. Are there any further insights? Will it crop up in an audit? If not, it may fall within our annual review of the OPW.</p>

          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2021-12-16T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_651">On that matter, it is probably best if it is dealt with in the context of consideration of the OPW and the appropriation account. As I recall, the site was actually in the ownership of the OPW. It is not that it identified and bought the site. As such, the issue really relates to whether it is a good option for delivering the service that is required, rather than being a procurement issue. The project is under way. I am not 100% certain what stage it is at. The Deputy raised questions previously in respect of whether it will provide the level of accommodation that is required by An Garda Síochána. The Garda will have a view on the issue as well. If An Garda Síochána appears before the committee, that might be a matter members wish to raise with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_653">In fairness, other issues relating to the OPW will come up. We had it in twice already. I know the site on Military Road is an issue in terms of whether the accommodation is adequate but there are a range of other issues as well because the OPW has a wide remit. We should add it to the agenda to have it appear in the new year, as well as the Department of Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> I return to the issue of TII and the NTA. Any member wishing to come in on this should raise his or her hand. From what members have said, it would be a bit too compressed to try to do the whole lot in one 90-minute morning session. There would be less than an hour and a half for the next one. I propose that we take one organisation in the morning and the other in the afternoon. We will send an invitation to them on that basis. </p>
          <p eId="para_655"> That concludes our consideration of the work programme for today. Are there any other matters members wish to raise before the committee goes into private session? We will now go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 20 January, when we will engage with Raidió Teilifís Éireann.</p>
