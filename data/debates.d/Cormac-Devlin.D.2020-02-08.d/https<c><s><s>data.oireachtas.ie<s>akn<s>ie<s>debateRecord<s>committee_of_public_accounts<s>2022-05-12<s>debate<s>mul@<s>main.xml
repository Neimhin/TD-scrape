          <p eId="para_12">I welcome everyone to the meeting. No apologies have been received. Please note that to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, to be respectful of other people’s physical space and to adhere to any other public health advice. When people are speaking, obviously they can take off their masks.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee. He is accompanied by Mr. Peter Kinsley, deputy director of audit, from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> This morning, we engage with the University of Limerick, UL, to examine its 2020 financial statements. The university has been advised that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters to which the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention: non-compliant procurement; the purchase of a site for the city campus, formerly known as the Dunnes Stores site; the overriding of controls; and the president’s remuneration. UL has also been advised the committee might wish to examine the fact the Department had withheld capital funding until certain governance issues have been resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the university: Professor Kerstin Mey, president; Ms Mary Harney, chancellor; and Mr. Gary Butler, chief financial performance officer. We are also joined by the following officials from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science: Mr. Keith Moynes, assistant secretary with responsibility for the higher education policy division; and Ms Emma Leonard, principal officer with responsibility for the climate action and capital planning unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. As such witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits or objective of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2022-05-12T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_21">The group total income of the University of Limerick for the accounting year 2019-2020 was €288 million. Some €90 million of this is recurrent State grant and pension funding. Academic fees amounted to €113 million, with 28% of this received directly from the Higher Education Authority. Research income recognised in the year was €33 million, including more than €23 million from State sources. In the year, other income fell by €6 million, largely due to the impact of Covid-19 related restrictions. Total expenditure of the group in 2019-2020 was €285 million, representing an increase of €4 million. Pay and pension costs account for €196 million of this. The group surplus for the year 2019-2020 was €3.9 million, and this compared with a deficit of €2.1 million in the previous year.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> I am satisfied that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the transactions for the year and of the financial position of the university at end of September 2020. Consequently, my audit opinion on the financial statements was unqualified. As is the case for other universities, the audit report includes an emphasis on matters relating to the deferred pension funding asset. The purpose of this is to draw attention to the assumptions that underpin that part of the pension asset for which there is no explicit funding guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> My audit report also draws attention to four matters that are disclosed in the university’s annual statement of governance that accompanies the financial statements. The first matter is the significant expenditure incurred by the university on procurement that was not in compliance with the relevant procurement procedures. The second matter relates to the purchase of a property in Limerick in April 2019 for the development of a city centre campus. Arising from concerns raised by an employee, the university engaged a firm of consultants to conduct a review of the purchase. The review included an examination of the university’s due diligence procedures around the purchase as well as the accuracy of the information provided to the governing authority when its approval was sought for the purchase. Members will be aware from updates provided by the university that finalisation and dissemination of the report has been held up as a result of High Court proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> The third matter I draw attention to arises from an investigation into a series of allegations made in 2017 and 2020 about the actions of a member of the university’s senior management. The investigator found the senior manager had breached the university’s recruitment and procurement policies and procedures and, in relation to one of the allegations, the senior manager’s actions were both inappropriate and unprofessional. The senior manager had left the university before the investigation report was completed in November 2020. The statement of governance sets out the progress in implementing the recommendations in the investigation report.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The final matter I draw attention to in my audit report relates to the arrangements entered into by the university relating to the resignation of the former president, effective from the end of August 2020. The contract of employment with the former president did not contain clauses dealing with early termination or a notice period, which are standard clauses in employment contracts. Following negotiations, the university paid an amount equivalent to four months’ salary, some €65,000, and just over €30,000 in respect of legal costs incurred by the former president. It also incurred legal costs of more than €15,000 on its own behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Having reviewed the documentation relating to these payments, in my view, the agreement with the former president has the typical characteristics of a severance agreement. Therefore, before agreeing to the terms for ending the employment, the university should have consulted the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science about what was proposed and secured the prior approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Those steps were not taken in this case. The statement of governance presents the university’s view that the arrangement with the former president around his departure was not a severance agreement and, therefore, did not require prior approval of the Departments.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">I welcome Professor Mey back to the committee for her second appearance. As detailed in the letter of invitation, she will have five minutes for her opening statement. I note the statement is very long, so I would ask her to summarise it in four or five minutes. It has been made available to members.</p>

          <from> Professor Kerstin Mey<recordedTime time="2022-05-12T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend today’s meeting, which concerns the financial statements of the University of Limerick for 2019-20. Those in attendance with me are Ms Mary Harney, chancellor of the University of Limerick, and Mr. Gary Butler, chief financial and performance officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> If the Chairman will allow, I would like to briefly share some thoughts on the institution, of which I am extremely proud to be president. A modern university must meet a variety of societal needs. It must be: a centre of high quality education and research; a place for the discovery of new knowledge and better understanding about the world and ourselves; and, perhaps most importantly, a vital force in realising the full cultural, social and economic potential of the communities it serves. Since its establishment, the University of Limerick has been a dynamic catalyst for change for the people of Limerick, the broader mid-west and nationally. The capacity of our university to build and sustain deep and mutually beneficial relationships with industry continues to be a major driver of the region’s economic prosperity and social transformation. In addition, our strong academic and growing international research profile has attracted talented people across a broad range of disciplines, nationalities and cultures to come here to study, live and work.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Beginning this month, the University of Limerick will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its establishment in 1972. In addition to celebrating our unique heritage, this will be an opportunity for us to articulate and promote our excellence in research and education and highlight the extraordinary achievements of our students, alumni and staff. This important anniversary also coincides with, and has very much informed, our current strategic plan, UL@50, which we have recently refreshed, and also the development of our sustainability framework, which will provide us with a roadmap for development over the next decade. Students are at the heart of everything we do and the campus settings in which they receive their education is to the forefront of our drive for sustainability. Our objective during the lifetime of the strategic plan and beyond is to ensure that the university continues to evolve and prosper and contributes to a thriving world so that we can continue to provide future generations with an exceptional, inclusive and recreational environment in which they can excel.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> I would like to share with the committee the performance of University of Limerick relative to its peers during the past number of years. We are honoured to be the recipient of multiple awards for our world class campus, marketing and communications success, excellence in the provision of academic and professional services, gender equality in higher education, our research and for our incredible Erasmus programme. In addition, we have: grown our student numbers to well over 17,500; our graduate employment is up 15% on the national average; we have become the first Irish university to engage with apprenticeships from level 7 up to doctorate qualification; and we have surpassed 10% of employment market share in Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> Regarding our financial position, as requested, I have provided the committee with a comprehensive briefing paper outlining the university’s financial position at the end of the 2019-20 year. I have also provided some more detail on many of the matters which members raised at our previous attendance before committee. My intention in so doing is to assure the committee of my personal commitment, as president, to ensuring our university’s sterling reputation for excellence in education and research shall be matched by a commitment to the highest standards in corporate governance, transparency and accountability, and an open and inclusive, supportive and empowered organisational culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> The 2019-20 year was unique and was characterised by the extraordinary uncertainty that accompanied the arrival of a global pandemic. We also had to contend with the evolution of Brexit. The governing authority, executive committee and staff of the university, in partnership with the student unions, worked tirelessly to ensure the continuation of academic activities and impactful research while also safeguarding our financially sustainability. In the relevant period, the university returned a surplus of €3.9 million. The executive committee and the governing authority are agreed that this surplus must be reinvested in areas that will directly and demonstrably further enhance the student and staff experience, including implementing the broad learnings from Covid-19. At this month's governing authority meeting we agreed to consult widely, especially with the student body on our intentions in that regard. The consolidated university statement of comprehensive income and net profit for the year to 30 September 2020 are shown on page 38 of the financial statements. During the period in question, Covid-19 impacted virtually all areas of the university’s activities. From 12 March 2020, the campus was effectively closed to staff and students. While we continue to adhere to public health guidance and to assess ongoing and any permanent financial impact of the pandemic, it appears the worst is now behind us. Happily, the university is emerging from the pandemic in very good financial health.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> The Comptroller and Auditor General issued an unqualified audit opinion on the financial statements for 2019-20. The university welcomes this. In the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on information other than in the financial statements, attention is drawn to procurement non-compliance as disclosed in the annual governance statement; the purchase of a site for the city campus, the override of controls and the president’s remuneration. With respect to procurement, I draw the committee’s attention to a sustained reduction in the percentage of such expenditure deemed non-compliant. In the relevant period, non-compliance was 0.6%. That is two thirds lower than the prevailing rate in the sector, which is 1.8%. I am pleased to advise the committee that the university is one of the leading institutions regarding procurement compliance. There is still room for improvement, and I have outlined a number of further and better controls we have put in place. These will identify any future inadvertent or deliberate breach of public procurement protocols.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> The university is wholeheartedly committed to its civil and civic mission, and this is very much reflected in our strategic plan and the refreshed plan. We intend to contribute fully to the rejuvenation of Limerick city and we are working closely with our partners, including Limerick City and County Council, in that regard. We have opened up part of our existing city centre campus where our digital fabrication lab offers opportunities for exploration and learning to University of Limerick students as well as the community. The renovated space includes a Limerick City and County Council Community Engagement Hub and a further flexible space for teaching and events, which is heavily utilised. When circumstances permit, we hope to make the significant capital investment that will be required in order to develop a truly vibrant city campus, accessible to everyone and an exemplar of sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> I am well aware the committee has been particularly concerned to understand the circumstances which gave rise to the university’s acquisition of the former Dunnes Stores site for €8.343 million. KPMG was commissioned to conduct a review, which has been completed but which is the subject of a legal challenge. We are working with our legal advisers to try to unblock impediments to its publication. I appreciate this is still a very live issue. However, I hope the committee would permit me to draw a distinction between the process by which the property was acquired, arising from which the governing authority commissioned the KPMG review, and the enormous civic potential of this strategic site in the centre of Limerick city on the banks of the Shannon, which gives me cause for great optimism about the future of our city centre campus.</p>

Primarily I would like to afford time to the witnesses to take us through from April 2019 until today. I heard them speak about the investment in the site and their excitement for the university about this site. This cannot overlook the enormous cost of the site and the increased cost of the site from €3 million originally when it was valued by Limerick City and County Council to what was paid for it at more than €8 million. Will the witnesses take us through the reason for the increase in costs?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_55">
          <from> Ms Mary Harney<recordedTime time="2022-05-12T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_88">I thank Deputy Devlin. It is a very obvious question as to how we went from €3 million to €8 million. This did not happen. The €3 million referred to, both in the public domain and here, was a valuation done on behalf of Limerick City and County Council for the purposes of declaring the site derelict and putting it on the vacant site register. It was the council's intention to compulsorily purchase the site. Dunnes took on the council and got a judicial review. The council did not succeed in having the site declared derelict and put on the vacant site register. I want to read from the so-called valuation. It was carried out by a highly reputable national company. It states that the figure it provided was on a high-level desktop basis and represented its estimate of value of the unencumbered freehold interest in the property. It also states that in order to undertake a full evaluation, it would need to obtain confirmation of floor areas and undertake inspection. It further states that it would also need to know the planning potential of the site. The valuation document indicates that in view of the location of the property, it was likely at a minimum to be able to sustain six floors and perhaps more. It states that based on this approach, it could look at a valuation appraisal to assist in determining what the site value or acceptable purchase price would be. There was no €3 million valuation as a market value. It was a valuation done to declare the site derelict to put it on the vacant site register and for the council to compulsorily purchase it. The affidavit presented in the judicial hearing in which Dunnes got a stay showed that on 30 September 2015 and subsequently the council indicated it wanted to compulsorily purchase the site. I understand it might have wanted to put a cultural centre there.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> In 2013 or 2014, UL decided it should have a city centre campus as an experience for students and to play its part in the strategic development of the city. It looked at a number of sites and identified the Dunnes site as the preferred site. It is an iconic riverside site. It has been described as the preferred site in Limerick. Unfortunately, it was not available. Discussions took place with Dunnes over the time but it was not for selling. There was not a willing seller. There was a willing buyer. In April 2019, Dunnes indicated that it wanted to engage with the university to see if it was still interested. The university engaged in negotiations. Dunnes looked for €10 million. I understand from the documentation given to the governing authority that the university put €6.5 million on the table and that those involved in the negotiations settled on €8 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> When we made the decision to purchase this site on 5 April it was a unanimous decision. I have read there were dissenters. There were no dissenters. There was great enthusiasm and excitement because of the location of the site. We were told that valuation papers were tabled in the negotiations. We made our decision based on the information before us. It subsequently transpired, as a result of a freedom of information request, that there were no written valuation reports. We were horrified as governors that we were told something based on a document that did not exist. This is why we sought an independent inquiry. This is why it is so important for me and the governing body to know whether we were misled or given the full facts when we made our decision. We are entitled to expect if a proposal is coming from the president and deputy president of the university that all of the information in the memorandum and proposal is accurate. This is what we are awaiting in the KPMG report.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">Deputy Devlin is right. The governing authority decided we should have an investigation. The governance committee of the governing authority said it should be one of the big four. I was not involved in that and nor was the governing authority. The president can deal with that. Essentially, what the investigation was to do was establish whether or not the correct information and the full information was put before the governing authority. This is the purpose of the report. That is why I said it to the Chair that nobody wants it more than me and the governing body. I assure the committee that it comes up at every meeting as to why we cannot see the report and publish it and move on from the controversy. It was a really good story. When we got the site not only were we all excited in the university but it was very well received in Limerick that the university was going to come into the city and create a campus at that location. Unfortunately, since the freedom of information request and the knowledge that there was not a written valuation, the matter has been dogged by controversy, including here this morning. I regret this very much, as do my colleagues.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">I would like to update the committee on what we have done in terms of the preparation of the financial statements for 2020-21, which is the year following the one we are looking at this morning. In doing that, we did a review of the assets that the university had on its balance sheet in order to assess whether the carrying value was correct and was not overstated in the financial statements. In undertaking that exercise, we had independent advice on a reinstatement value for insurance purposes on the site as it stands and then a new-build cost if we were to build the equivalent today. Both of those figures came in at around €20 million. That gave us confidence that the amount that we were carrying in the financial statements was not overstated. This is a fairly common approach in terms of reassessing values each year to ensure that the financial statements give a true and fair view. That information was shared with our external auditors, PwC, in order that they could review it and approve the sign-off of the accounts.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">There is a governance process in place between the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the university. We have paused funding while we await the KPMG report because we wanted to close out that governance process. There is a process in place to look at the governance processes and to get assurance about them. That has been a constructive process between the HEA and the university.

          <p eId="para_105">I can answer that. Its a very good question. The current audit and risk committee recommended that we should bring in-house our internal audit function.

          <p eId="para_207">The situation is that one of the people who would be adversely affected by all of this is a former employee who has lodged papers with the High Court because, obviously, the contents of the report may put that person in a bad light, or that person may feel that. However, we can only surmise all of this because we have not seen it.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">If the chairperson of the board of governors has not seen it, what is the function of the board of governors of the university? I am actually puzzled at this stage. I read all the documentation the witnesses sent us. We have been trying to follow this. The more I look at the documentation, the more I am unable to figure out what exactly the role of the governing board of the university is. I have served on a number of different bodies but I have never come across a situation like this.</p>

          <p eId="para_292">I very much welcome our guests. I will start with the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement, where he stated his view that the agreement between the university and the former president regarding his resignation had the "typical characteristics" of a severance package. UL stated, based on its legal advice, it was satisfied that the recognition of payment did not constitute a severance package. It also referenced Circular 09/2018 and concluded that prior approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was unnecessary. I am trying to establish that the circular stated, in the case of a university, the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science required prior approval through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> I will provide the context in respect of the former president's resignation. He was paid more than €180,000 from 1 October 2019 to 31 August 2020. No contract or notice period was established in his terms of employment and he was paid €65,000 in September 2020 for his remaining four months, when an interim president was also appointed. His legal costs, which were in the region of €30,000, were covered by UL, in addition to UL's costs. Legal costs cost in the region of €45,000. My first question is for the Department's representative. Will he please explain whether the Department considered the former president's remuneration as a severance package? </p>

          <p eId="para_304">It would be helpful to have a little perspective here. On 5 May 2020, the president informed me he was going to resign because he said the virus impacted on his ability to serve the university. I sought a date from when that would take effect because we were in the middle of a pandemic. I pay tribute to the staff and students for the manner in which they adapted to the huge challenges of changing the way they worked and learned. We were getting ready to open up, which was the intention in September, and I wanted to make sure we had a president during that very difficult and challenging period.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> The then-president said he wanted to be paid for a year through his legal advisers. Bizarrely, his contract had no notice period. I took legal advice. The current Minister, Deputy Harris, in a similar situation when the director general of the HSE was resigning, said in the Dáil on 17 May 2018 that payment in lieu of notice is normal. The Department was involved in a Supreme Court case way back in 1940, the Murphy case, and there is also Independent Newspapers and the Carey case in August 2003. There is significant case law that suggests people are entitled to a payment in lieu of notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> I obviously did not want to pay a year. As we wanted to minimise that, negotiations took place between our external lawyers for the university and the former president's lawyers. As part of that, and on advice, legal fees were paid, which were €25,000 plus VAT. All of that was approved by the governing authority, although not the amount of the legal fees because we were not quite certain of it at that point. The governing authority approved the payment. The president got four months in lieu of notice and two months' holidays. He worked remotely until the end of August. I wanted to be in a situation where we could appoint an interim president and have a competition for it, rather than anoint somebody. That was obviously going to take some time over the summer. They are circumstances in which that was-----</p>

The university took a certain approach. Our own view, as a Department, was different. However, these are complex matters. The decision or interpretation that we took was that it was a severance. The university did not take that approach. The chancellor has outlined the rationale that the university took. We are taking a different view on that. These are complex issues and there are probably elements of judgment attached to them, but we take the view that this was a severance. We are looking at the issues.

          <p eId="para_346">The legal advice we received is that the agreement is in writing; that there is valuable consideration; that a sum of money is paid to the employee as consideration for waiving their rights; that the rights being waived are listed individually; that the employee is at a minimum strongly encouraged to take independent legal advice; and that the agreement specifies the working arrangements for the remainder of their relationship. It would typically also be included that the agreement is unequivocal in full and final settlement of all claims, with either a stipulation in relation to confidentiality or a reminder that existing obligations continue. The return of the employer’s property, as well as a confidentiality clause in relation to the settlement agreement itself, are typical.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">I thank the witnesses for being here today. I want to return to the issue of the site purchase for the city campus, and particularly the events of 5 April, when there was a governing authority meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I will preface my comments by saying that I differ slightly from some of the previous members in that I would be concerned, as a member of the Committee on Public Accounts, if, despite legal advice not to publish the KPMG report, the university went ahead and did so and, as a result, the State or the university incurred significant costs. I would like to say that. However, I echo the absolute concern raised by all the members here, as well as, I can imagine, by the members of the governing authority, who do not feel that they can see sight of that KPMG report. I will return to that in a moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> In essence, the KPMG report is a University of Limerick document. It was commissioned by the University of Limerick. It has no statutory basis. It is essentially a report that from the university and that was commissioned to KPMG for the university. Would that be correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_354">That is correct. Okay. It is not unusual, I suppose, for people who are party to the findings of a report to seek the recourse of the courts to prevent their publication. This happens pretty much with every Government report that files a hard finding. All of that being said, I understand the university’s position, but I hope the witnesses will appreciate our frustration as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> I will come back to the issue of 5 April. I think Ms Harney said earlier in her comments that the governing authority was told that an independent valuation was available. Is that Ms Harney’s evidence? Perhaps she might speak to that point.</p>

It is a riverside site. It is the premier site in Limerick. A property person said to me recently that if it had gone on the open market, there would have been a cat-and-dog fight for it. We were therefore excited that we now had it. At that point, after we got it, Limerick City and County Council dropped its attempts to have it declared derelict and put on the vacant site register. There was great enthusiasm, both within the university and externally. I do not think that the enthusiasm over getting the site took away from our responsibility to use our critical faculties and to look at the proposal before us-----</p>

          <p eId="para_371">I can understand why it might be the preferred site. However, Ms Harney can understand our concern that just three days earlier, a funding application had been submitted to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, which included options. This site had not been included in that. First, I cannot get my head around why, if this was the preferred site, it was not included in that application. Second, just three days had passed. Can Ms Harney talk about how a document can be submitted to the HEA, but three days later an entirely different proposal can come before the governing authority?</p>

          <p eId="para_372">That is an excellent question. From memory, in December 2018, the governing authority approved the procurement of what is called the "opera site". It was not an ideal site, but it was the only other site that was available. We approved that and then we made an application to the higher education strategic infrastructure fund. That application was only submitted a couple of days. When the president phoned me to put the matter of the Dunnes Stores site on the agenda for 5 April, among the reasons he used was the fact that we needed to change the site for the purposes of the HEA application, as well as the fact that he did not want Dunnes Stores to change their mind. That is why it went to that meeting for a decision. The reason we wanted to go to the city centre, besides the fact that we wanted to play our part in revitalising the city, is that the university, for those who do not know, is 4 km east of Limerick city. We wanted to bring the university into the heart of the city. That has been an objective for quite a number of years.</p>

          <p eId="para_379">Speaking on the issue of good faith, and I accept what Ms Harney has said, a document comes before her outlining an option to purchase it. I imagine there is huge enthusiasm in the room for it and it is approved. I accept all of that. However, there is a difference between that and the results of the FOI where the governing authority was told that a valuation took place and FOI and I imagine the university's own investigation show that no valuation took place.</p>

We were told that valuations were tabled at the negotiations so clearly when you are told that, you assume written valuations are tabled. What transpired when the FOI request came in looking for a copy of that valuation was that no such valuation existed. That sent alarm bells ringing among the governing authority.</p>

          <p eId="para_397">Where I would disagree with Ms Harney is on the idea that the corporate entity cannot share the document among itself. In my view, the document is within the University of Limerick and I do not see any reason why the governing authority could not see that report in advance of it being published unless it had received legal advice that circulating it to 27 people on a governing authority would be tantamount to publication. I believe the governing authority or at least a sub-committee of the governing authority should have access to that KPMG report given that it is an internal document.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">The reason I am asking Professor Mey this question is because right now, the educational landscape within the State is such that there are employees of universities or technological universities on precarious contracts. To my knowledge, there are not enough people in proper career progression. Many lecturers are still below the bar and are going from contract to contract. I speak for staff within the University of Limerick. It seems to me that if there is a withdrawal or holding back of funding, it stymies the ability of the university to fulfill its mission and obligations to its own staff but also its wider mission to the mid-west and Munster region. I say this as a former Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation. I am very much aware of the work of EPI-STEM, Lero and other such entities and the translational effect of the research provided by the University of Limerick. I worry that if the HEA is withholding funding, it will have a downstream effect on the university's ability to allow staff to progress from below the bar to above the bar positions or to allow the university to ensure that people progress and that there is a career path for employees within the university. Is it the case that the holding back of this funding is affecting staff's ability to progress?</p>

          <p eId="para_409"> We learned about the €2 million mentioned by Mr. Moynes from a media outlet last Thursday, which I believe was very unfortunate. We were completely blindsided. We first learned we were approved for the grant and we also heard in the same call that the grant was being paused. That is not the way to do business. This blindsided us and it damages our relationships. I know the president has had a call from the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to apologise over the leak. He does not know how it happened. I hope we can engage with the Minister have these moneys paid over to the university as quickly as possible. The Deputy is correct because this does impact on our ability to make things happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">I, together with the chair of the audit and risk committee, met with the HEA chairman and CEO last August and I believe they were genuinely impressed with all the reforms the governing body had carried out in the university. The governing authority confirmed all those reforms and I, together with the president, had another meeting with them, including the CEO, on, I believe, 12 November. I believe the HEA, and I am not speaking for it nor do I have any such right, is satisfied serious reforms in governance have taken place at the University of Limerick. I hope the Minister, when he visits the university on the 23rd of this month and engages with the president and her colleagues, will be in a position to release that funding.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">Moving on then to what are reasonably modest but significant sums nonetheless in respect of what has been spent on external consultancy costs and adviser fees, the university spent nearly €600,000 on project management services, total legal expenditure was €926,000, estate planning was €250,000, brand refresh and implementation was €87,000, and public relations was €33,000. This is all money that has been spent on external services. Will the president tell me why the university spending €595,000 on project management services and what are these services? That is my first question for her.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> Also, in respect of the brand refresh and implementation, €87,000 would pay the fees for one lecturer above the bar, if I can put it that way. My focus here is on staff and students, on what they are receiving and on what I would call their rights and entitlements. It seems to me the amount of money, which is approximately €3.1 million and is a significant amount, is all money that has been in spent on external services that could reasonably have been expected to be ploughed into investing in staff, educational output, and research output.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">I thank the Deputy for his question. The university is a dynamic institution and develops rapidly and radically in the realisation of its vision to offer excellent education and research. A number of projects have been carried out in that space to support the university to realise its ambition going forward. I already talked about the brand refresh, that i was essential for us to have our appearance in the marketplace in line with the character of the institution, which is actually something that supports us in recruiting, attracting talent and affirming our position in a global and very competitive marketplace. On the details of the expenditure, I will bring in my colleague, Mr. Butler, to talk the committee through some of the details.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">Will the president speak specifically to the legal expenditure, because this is by far the greatest amount at €926,000? In 2019, the university spent €1.04 million on legal expenditure alone. It is a hell of a lot of money on legal fees.</p>

          <p eId="para_416">I will come in on that question, if I may. The president referred earlier to the expenditure on the legal fees and we said we would provide more detail on that. It creates a situation whereby there are a number of cases for which legal advice was needed. We also often seek legal advice throughout the university on different developments we are undertaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> On the expenditure mentioned by the Deputy, I would also like to comment on project management and consultancy. These are large figures but are an investment in our student record system. This system was introduced in 1999 and it is fair to say there was not regular investment in that, so a project has been undertaken to update and refresh that system to ensure it is fit for purpose. It is the bedrock of the university in how it manages its student records, and that investment will continue because the university takes very seriously the ability to have systems that work and are fit for purpose. That is the area around which the consultancy and project management moneys were spent. Further investment will be seen in these areas in future years.</p>

          <p eId="para_472">I am happy to repeat it. If the Deputy has not heard it, it is worth hearing because it will help our engagement. The €3 million valuation - I read from that report - that was done for the purpose was desktop. No inspection took place of the property and it was to be used for internal purposes only. That was emphasised by the reputable company that carried it out. It was done for the purposes of having the site declared derelict and having it put on the vacant site register because the council wanted to CPO it. Dunnes took a judicial review and it got a stay on that happening. UL always wanted to move into the city because we are four miles east of the city centre. That was identified as the preferred site but there was not a willing seller. However, in April 2019 Dunnes approached the university and asked if we were still interested and the university said yes. Negotiations took place between the university and Dunnes Stores. My understanding from what the governing authority was told is that we made an opening offer of €6.5 million. Dunnes was looking for €10 million and through the negotiations we settled on €8 million. That proposal was put to the governing authority and it unanimously supported that proposal. In the context of that proposal the governing authority was told that valuation statements were advanced in those negotiations. It subsequently transpired that there was no written valuation when a FOI request was submitted. The governing authority was obviously concerned that there was no written valuation and that is why the KPMG inquiry was established.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">The point I make is that €3 million is not a valuation. It is a derelict site, a vacant site. I am sure the Deputy knows that if someone is going to CPO property they put in an opening offer. It sometimes goes two, three or four times higher than that. I do not want to read it again but it is in the record here. The people who carried out that valuation said it was desktop that they had not seen the property and they would need to have access to it and inspect it to know its potential from a planning point of view and then they would give a valuation in the context of a purchase or acquisition. The point I make is that €3 million cannot be compared with €8 million. It would not be fair or right to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">Earlier I dealt with that as well. The former president informed me on 5 May that he wanted to resign because he was not able to carry out his duties because he was vulnerable to Covid. I sought to get a date from the president. He engaged through his lawyers and said he wanted a 12 month payment in lieu of notice. Unfortunately his contract of employment had no notice period. We took legal advice. There is a lot of case law which I mentioned earlier. Carey<i> v.</i> Independent Newspapers, Murphy <i>v.</i> Department of Education and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, in the context of the resignation of the director general of the HSE all upheld that in this kind of situation payment in lieu of notice is paid. The negations took place between our lawyers and the lawyers for the former president. They settled on a four-month payment in lieu of notice. He got two months where he worked virtually. Part of it was his holidays. It was four months. If it had been a severance payment he would have been entitled to over €12,000 tax free. We taxed it all. If it had been a severance payment of course I would have consulted the Department. That would never be an issue for somebody like me. I would naturally follow the advice and do what was appropriate. The Department spoke earlier. We differ on this. They say doctors differ and patients die. Lawyers differ too. The Department's view from its legal perspective and the view we had were very different and I followed the legal advice that was available to me</p>

          <p eId="para_478">I thank Ms Harney. There has been significant concern around the cost of the new student centre. It is around €20 million. There was an increase which was understandable in the context of construction related inflation that has taken place.

          <p eId="para_479">The facts are right. As the Deputy may be aware, the project had to go out to a new tender to employ a construction firm. The tender process was concluded but the prices for construction are further exploding. Therefore the contract with the current construction firm, as far as I am aware, has not yet been concluded amid fear of a further spiralling of the costs could create issues for the construction firm.</p>

Suffice it to say that we carried out an independent investigation. The disclosure in this case came to my predecessor but proceedings were paused at the request of the person who initially made the complaint. It then came to me to be activated. As is the procedure, I appointed a group from the governing authority to look at the allegation. This group appointed Ms McKenna, a barrister, to carry out the investigation. Her report then came to hand. She made findings and each of these has either been implemented or is in the process of being implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_528">As to what has been implemented, we are pioneers in higher education and were the first university to deal with apprenticeships. We offer six apprenticeships so far and a seventh will commence in September. These apprenticeships start at level 7 and reach up to level 10, doctoral level, in the case of principal engineers. We are providing the talents for the future. We have developed a range of innovative flexible programmes, including professional diploma and microcredential programmes, to support the reskilling and upskilling agenda of the Government and the national skills strategies. Significant processes of transformation have already taken place in the university. We have significantly enhanced our research performance with regard to quality, international standing and the money that has been competitively awarded under the Horizon 2020 projects. We were the best performing university engaged in both rounds of the July stimulus package. Our graduate employability is 50% higher than the national average.</p>

With regard to the accounts for 2020, I note that the total expenditure on legal matters was €926,000. That sounds extremely high. Even at €400 an hour, that is 2,320 hours. I am being generous with that €400 an hour. At 40 hours a week, that is 58 weeks of legal advice. That sounds extremely high. Are there a number of major legal proceedings ongoing?

We are going to use every legal vehicle open to us to make that report available to the governing body and, I hope, to the committee and others. It would be an awful pity if the body that asked for the report, which was commissioned by the university, could not get sight of the report before its term of office ends.</p>

Earlier, I outlined a process that we went through called the 2020-2021 financial statements where we did a review of the carrying value of all the assets on the balance sheet.

We have reduced that to €2 million. We have done a lot on governance issues to make sure that our oversight role is taken seriously.

When it was brought to my attention by the president, because it was not part of our strategic plan and we had not done a business case, I did not allow that to go to the governing authority and asked for the money to be withdrawn, which it was. A subcommittee of the governing body was set up to look at whether we should have a facility in Dublin. I assure Deputy Burke that we use our critical faculties to make sure that anything we are doing is in compliance with our strategic vision.

In response to the previous questions, Ms Harney said "we trusted what was put before us".

Even when we decided to enter negotiations to buy the opera site, the preferred site would have been the Dunnes site but it was not available. The proposal was in writing, including pictures of the facility etc., and was put before the board. To the best of my knowledge, the deputy president presented the report and the president made comments. Two members of the governing body asked questions. One asked if full due diligence was done and was assured it was. Another asked when the facility would be made available and was told the end of May or June.

It is in the interests of everybody on the governing authority, particularly those who attended the meeting on 5 April and voted for this proposal. It is also in the public interest.

          <p eId="para_686">Ms Harney is chancellor of the university and chairperson of the governing body. She stated that nobody expressed concerns in respect of the valuation of the site. I am puzzled about this. A verbal assurance was given but no documentation was presented, yet no one asked was there a second valuation or evidence of a second or third valuation. I have sat on boards that handle far smaller amounts of money than this - I chaired one of them - and I can assure Ms Harney that for deals that involve a tiny fraction of this amount, one would seek not one or two but three valuations. One would not rely on a person's word. Much of this seemed to rely on the good faith of former senior staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> Ms Harney mentioned and Professor Mey confirmed that a deposit was paid on a house in Dublin that did not fit in with the strategic plan. Certain individuals sailed off to Dublin and put a deposit - I do not know how much it was - on a house the purpose of which was questionable. Obviously, it was decided that the house was not needed and that decision was probably correct. Fair play for stopping it. The same individuals, however, sailed in to the university and stated that there was a site that was worth nearly three times what Limerick City Council valued it at but no one questioned that or asked for a written copy of even one valuation. That is beyond belief.</p>

There were a number of additional procurements where there were extensions of contracts because there was a reliance on the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, to complete processes.

We will be starting a cultural audit to identify where there is room for improvement that will involve all among members of the campus community. Since I have taken on the role as interim president and now as president I have worked hard to establish consultation processes, dialogue and a new communications platform so that we have regular exchanges. The executive goes on roadshows in order to develop a much more dialogical relationship in the universities and all of that contributes to establishing a culture of empowerment and trust that is underpinned by transparency and full accountability.</p>

          <p eId="para_736">The whistleblowers came forward and the witnesses have told us that the process was paused. Then there was a fresh round and the McKenna report followed that. I am reading from the briefing document, which states that the investigator found evidence that a member of senior management had breached the university's policy and procedures, that in the case of one allegation the investigation found that the actions of the member of senior management were inappropriate and non-professional, and that this manager left the university. Was any payment made to that person on leaving the university? Are there other protected disclosures in this same range of issues that are unresolved at this stage? Deputy Munster asked a question earlier about how recruitment happened. Does this relate to that issue? Can the witnesses give us some sort of indication on what the terms "inappropriate" and "non-professional" mean?</p>

Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have a view on whether the exit package as described has characteristics of a severance package or would it have been appropriate for departmental approval to have been given?

          <p eId="para_752">I am satisfied that it has the substantial characteristics of a severance. In my view, sanction from the Department should have been sought in that regard. It is clearly a legal issue. The only way to finally thrash it out would be through a legal case. There is not one in this situation. The problem clearly stemmed from the comprehensiveness or lack of comprehensiveness of the original contract of employment. We have looked at other universities and seen the kinds of scenarios like termination and notice period included in the contract of employment. It is clearly good practice, and I expect to see the University of Limerick doing that in future. There is a learning there.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> As to the value of the settlement or agreement, that is something on which I have not previously commented. In every situation, the circumstances determine what is a reasonable amount.

          <p eId="para_774">The business before us is the minutes from previous meetings, accounts and financial statements, correspondence, our work programme, and any other business. The minutes of our meeting of 5 May were circulated to members. Do members wish to raise any matters? Are the minutes agreed? Agreed. As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> No financial statements and accounts were presented to the Oireachtas Library between 2 and 6 May 2022. We will return to this item next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Moving to correspondence, as previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee’s meetings and published on the committee’s web page.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both, and follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts. No. 1217 B is from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 28 April 2022, enclosing the minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in response to our report on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board’s 2019 financial statements. Our first recommendation was that the report outlining the timeline and estimated costs for the completion of the national paediatric hospital be published as a matter of urgency. We have requested sight of it on a number of occasions. The response to the recommendation, which is not accepted, restates the board and the Department’s position that the analysis is commercially sensitive and “must remain confidential at this time, so as to ensure that the NPHDB’s ability to enforce the contract is not prejudiced, and ultimately the project is not adversely affected.” In our latest correspondence with the Department on this topic, we asked for clarification as to whether the report could be provided to the committee on a confidential basis, and we await that clarification.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> Our second recommendation, which was accepted, included a number of changes that will improve transparency in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board’s accounts in respect of expenditure on this project, and that is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Our third recommendation was that future capital projects of this scale prioritise value for money, which was also accepted, and that a comprehensive review is carried out following completion of the project to ensure lessons are learned for future capital projects. This is a requirement under the public spending code and will be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carthy have flagged this item for discussion. I ask Deputy Carthy to try to be brief.</p>

          <p eId="para_781">There is not much to say. Again, the issue of commercial sensitivity in respect of the hospital is being cited as reason for not providing this committee with a report that was previously promised to us before its publication. For the life of me I do not understand how if there is a contract in place, the publication of a report into that contract could result in commercial difficulties. We have been in regular contact with the Department of Health in respect of this, but I propose that we write back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform asking it if it has an estimate of the final costing of the children's hospital and, if so, if it will share it with the committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_782">The Chairman has stated that the committee recommends "that a comprehensive review is carried out following completion of this project to ensure lessons are learned for future capital projects". We do not know what the timeline of this is, but it could be another couple of years before it is completed and we see the conclusion of this. In the meantime, a similar project which was earmarked as costing €300 million in 2017 is now being talked about as a project of the same scale costing €1 billion, that is, the new national maternity hospital, which is equally mired in controversy about its site. It is very difficult to see how lessons are learned if the project is completed before the other one starts. How do we get even an interim understanding or some lessons? The two-phase process is not similar, but how do we get some lessons we do not have to wait another five years for? That is what it looks like. We will have the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in before the committee. It would be useful to know what the most recent set of accounts is and whether another set of accounts is due soon.</p>

          <p eId="para_783">I will have to check that for the Deputy. The 2020 accounts are the latest set on which an audit has been completed. I will get an update for the committee for next week as to where the 2021 accounts are and when we expect to have them. I just do not have that information at the minute.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">The next item of correspondence is No. 1221 B, from Ms Anne Graham, chief executive of the National Transport Authority, NTA, dated 29 April, providing information requested by the committee regarding public funding of An Taisce. It is proposed to note and publish the correspondence. Is that agreed? Deputy Carthy, you have flagged this for discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_786">I do not have much comment other than to say that this correspondence should be a template for other agencies and Departments as to how to answer questions because, in fairness, the NTA answered the questions comprehensively and succinctly where necessary and should be commended for that. It is to be hoped others will follow suit. It is refreshing to put questions to an organisation and to get the questions asked answered.</p>

          <p eId="para_787">We will note and publish the correspondence.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> The next item of correspondence is No. 1222 B, from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 29 April. It provides information requested by the committee regarding National Broadband Ireland's 2022 updated interim remedial plan. The plan confirms a target of 102,000 premises passed by the end of contract year three, which is 31 January 2023. The Secretary General states that "under the contract, National Broadband Ireland is entitled to claim relief against its contractual obligations in circumstances where delays are due to circumstances beyond its control (such as the global pandemic)". The national broadband plan is approximately 12 months behind schedule, eight and a half of which are accepted by the Department, as Members will note in the correspondence, as beyond NBI's control. It appears that sanctions will apply in respect of the other three and a half months. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> I raised this over lunch break, when we had the opportunity to raise it with the Taoiseach. It was not to get in before I said it at this meeting, but I pointed out to him and the officials from his Department the fact that at least three and a half months are not accepted as within NBI's control. It is important a penalty is levied for that. The Taoiseach committed to speaking to the Minister about it. One of the reasons given in the correspondence relates to blocked ducts. It can be expected when starting to push cables through existing duct that there will be problems and glitches. Covid has been overplayed as a reason, as I have mentioned before. In the first quarter of last year, 2021, NBI was on the ground working, as far as I could see. If it was not, it should have been. While progress would have slowed, there was a certain amount of work NBI could do. It is important that we keep on with that and that, along with raising the matter with the Taoiseach, the committee writes back to the Department asking it to clarify if a penalty is now being levied for those three and a half months. On page 3 of the correspondence it states, "While these are addressed by the ... [updated interim remedial plan], sanctions are accruing against non-delivery of those Milestones." That is what it says about non-delivery. We should question that. Deputy Carthy, do you want to come in briefly on this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MattCarthy" eId="spk_718">
          <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2022-05-12T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_790">You have asked a number of the questions, Chairman. We were informed, if I recall correctly, that the target of 60,000 premises to be passed by March was still in place at the time of our hearing. My understanding is that the most up-to-date figures we have received are that 41,000 premises or thereabouts were passed. I think that those figures relate to last month and that only a little over 9,000 premises had actually been connected. There is a problem here and, for the life of me, I do not understand why the Department is not live to that and reflecting the urgency of remedial actions in order to get this project back on track. We have talked about the huge costs involved in this project and the number of communities that are desperately awaiting broadband. The Government pursued this particular mechanism to deliver it and, clearly, NBI is not doing it in line with its own targets and milestones. We need to keep on top of this issue, particularly in respect of the penalties, as you have mentioned, Chairman, and whether or not they are being applied or whether or not they can be applied. The fact that penalties have not applied to date is concerning from my point of view.</p>

          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2022-05-12T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_791">It is important. I am certainly not a fan of the contract, but whatever powers are there need to be used because only 27,000 premises out of the original 115,000 were reached by January, and we are now moving into phase three.</p>

          <p eId="para_794">It should not be arbitrary. The numbers are black-and-white. I know that allowances were made for Covid for time that was not available, but that cannot continue to be used as an excuse. In fact, if Covid has showed us anything, it is that it is even more essential that reliable broadband be provided.</p>

          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2022-05-12T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_795">It is important we pursue the matter because Members will note that in the reply given to me in the Dáil Chamber about a year and a half ago a Minister said there were no penalties. It is important we are absolutely clear. It is the first time I have seen any document from the Department state that sanctions are accruing against non-delivery of these milestones. The importance of this is that it is a first, so it is important that that is seen through.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">We will ask for clarification of that and of the nature of the penalty, that is, whether it is a financial penalty or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> The final item of correspondence is No. 1223B, from Mr. Mattie McCabe, board secretary of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, dated 29 April 2022 providing information requested by the committee arising from our meeting on 24 March 2022 with the SEAI. The correspondence provides responses to eight questions across a range of areas, including retrofitting and electric vehicles, EVs. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Is that also agreed? Agreed. Deputy Catherine Murphy indicated that she wants to discuss this further. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_724">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-05-12T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_798">Yes. We are in a very different environment now as against last year and this retrofitting scheme really has to succeed. It is important that we ask the Department how it is taking into account the changed environment in relation to inflation in both labour and materials and to get an update on same. It is useful to get this response but we are going to have to keep on top of that because we have legal obligations to meet our targets and if inflation is going to be an impediment, it would be an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> I wish to raise another issue. We had a discussion last week with the Department of Finance and I asked a question in relation to the target of 100,000 EVs by 2030. It is a nice round figure and I am always very wary of round figures. Apparently the Department of Transport provided that figure but there does not appear to have been a robust exchange between the Departments of Finance and Transport on the ability to achieve that target but we will end up paying fines if we do not achieve it. That is the point I was making last week, that it will come back on the Department's budget. I suggest that we look at the McKinsey report on the second-hand EV market because the vast majority of people will not be able to buy new EVs at their current prices.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">The McKinsey report. It is referred to in the final paragraph. We need to follow up on how to reduce the price of EVs. I personally think that the strategy should focus more on public transport and getting really good transport systems in place but the Government's strategy is to get 100,000 EVs on the road by 2030, a target with which we are supposed to comply but I do not see evidence of a sufficiently robust exchange between the various Departments on this.</p>

          <p eId="para_804">That is fine Deputy Murphy.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> The next item on our agenda is the work programme. The following engagements are confirmed for May: the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 May and the Department of Health and the HSE on 26 May. Two meetings have also been confirmed in June, namely, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on 2 June and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on 16 June. We also agreed to schedule an engagement to examine local government oversight and accountability in June. If we were to hold one engagement in relation to local government on 23 June, that would leave three meeting slots before the summer recess. I ask members to review the work programme in advance of next week’s meeting so that we can prioritise engagements for those remaining meeting slots. We had a discussion earlier about how to handle the local government issue and agreed that we would bring in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Is that agreed? Agreed. Again, I ask members to review the suggestions that were submitted for the work programme and to let the clerk know if there is any issue they would like to prioritise for the vacant slots before the summer recess and we can agree them next week. </p>
          <p eId="para_806"> As there are no matters that members wish to raise in relation to the work programme, I will take it as agreed. As I said, if there are any specific items of interest, please revert to the clerk. Is there any other business that members wish to raise? As everyone is happy, we will adjourn the meeting now.</p>
