          <p eId="para_3"> I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to update the House on the Covid-19 vaccine programme. Like so much of our nation's response to the pandemic, the vaccine programme is testament to the way that Ireland, as a nation, has come together to show the best of what it can achieve. One of the most powerful demonstrations of how the pandemic has brought out the best is in the development of vaccines against Covid-19. Private sector innovation has merged with public sector investment and support to ensure the speedy development of safe and effective vaccines. This is particularly evident in the procurement process devised by the European Commission which allows member states to access a portfolio of candidate vaccines against Covid-19. Through the leveraging of the EU's emergency support instrument, funding has been provided to vaccine manufacturers to meet, in some instances, the cost of production for a vaccine.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">As stated, 66,000 doses were administered to the residents and staff of long-term residential care facilities and 77,000 doses to front-line healthcare workers. The HSE also commenced administration of the second dose of the vaccine last week in 27 nursing homes and in hospital groups. That work of administering second doses is being significantly stepped up this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> The presence of Covid-19 in a number of care facilities continues to be a challenge and has meant that some residents and staff could not be vaccinated. Due to outbreaks of Covid-19, four nursing homes out of a total of 589 were not included in the first series of vaccinations on the basis of public health assessments and in some others it was not possible to vaccinate all residents and staff due to their Covid status. Those who were unable to receive a first dose will be vaccinated once it is deemed safe to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> It is important that all stakeholders are aware of how dynamic the situation is with regard to supply chains. This means that Ireland has to employ an agile plan to react to changes. For example, some adjustments may be necessary to the original target of doses being administered in March to take account of AstraZeneca's recent announcement regarding reduced or lower than expected deliveries of its vaccine.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> Acting on behalf of member states, the European Commission has negotiated six advance purchase agreements with a range of vaccine suppliers to date. In total, between initial volumes procured and additional opt-ins, Ireland has advance purchased over 14 million doses of vaccine. I wish to acknowledge the major efforts of the European Commission in developing the initiative and bringing it to fruition. Currently there are two vaccines in receipt of conditional market authorisation from the Commission and the European Medicines Agency, EMA. These vaccines, which are produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, have been reviewed by the EMA which has provided significant assurance that they are both safe and effective. These vaccines are currently being administered as part of Ireland's vaccination programme. The reduction in the quantity of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine supplies across the EU for one week was a challenge. The reduction in supply was required to allow the company to make necessary changes to expand its production. The increased level of production capacity will be beneficial for member states, including Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> A third vaccine supplier, AstraZeneca, submitted its application for conditional market authorisation to the EMA and may receive approval from the European Commission as early as tomorrow. Obviously, we are watching that situation very carefully. Ireland has secured 3.3 million doses of this vaccine and it is envisaged that its availability will be crucial in the context of vaccinations to be administered by pharmacists and GPs in our communities. Recently, AstraZeneca advised that it will be unable to meet its initial delivery commitments if or when it receives conditional market authorisation. I am advised that this is due to difficulties arising at one of its manufacturing plants in Belgium. Negotiations with the company are continuing. At a meeting last night, the company was still not in a position to provide clarity on full deliveries after the middle of March. While it is anticipated that this should not impact on the start date for the roll-out of the vaccination programme to the over-70s living in the community, its impact upon the pace of vaccinations is still difficult to gauge at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> It is important to note that funding was provided by the Commission, which leveraged its emergency support instrument, to facilitate production of vaccines on behalf of member states. This instrument is ultimately funded by the member states themselves. AstraZeneca's vaccine has been delivered to other countries outside of the EU. The Commission, understandably, wishes to find out how the funds that it has provided to AstraZeneca were used, given the absence of agreed doses of the vaccine. Greater control measures to monitor the export of vaccines and associated transparency measures may be the best mechanisms to facilitate this process and is something on which the Commission is actively engaged with the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> A feature of the vaccination programme is that the administration of vaccines will only be limited by supply. While vaccines are currently being administered to the first and second cohorts, namely, those in long-term residential care and front-line healthcare workers, the intention is to provide access to free vaccination for all adults. The vaccination programme conducted by the HSE exceeds expectations and is a testament to the commitment of all involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> I would like to finish by acknowledging the work of everyone involved in the vaccination programme. This includes: our school vaccination teams, community teams and peer-to-peer hospital teams; our GPs, practice nurses and pharmacists; the trainers who have trained thousands to vaccinate and who will train many thousands more; the Defence Forces who are working with us around the country; the national ambulance service, who have been quite extraordinary both in terms of vaccinations and their wider response to Covid-19; and the nursing home staff, both nurses and administrative staff, who have been really important in making sure we were able to get into the nursing homes as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">It also includes a group of people who do not get much attention and who are not seen, namely, the women and men working behind the front line. A large number of people are working behind the front line in logistics, management, IT and administration. The work done by both those on the front line and those behind it has been amazing. They have stepped up again and again. They work night and day and on weekends to make sure that the vaccination programme keeps moving and that the vaccine keeps getting out to the most vulnerable and to those who protect them. I will finish with a word of thanks to all of them. Not only are they stepping up and doing this incredible work, but they are doing it after a very difficult year in healthcare during which they and their colleagues have been asked to step up again and again, which they have done. I acknowledge them, their work and their commitment. Their work, commitment and professionalism are allowing us to protect our front-line healthcare workers and those who are most vulnerable and will soon allow us to move on to protect those over the age of 70 in the community. I thank them all.</p>

          <from>Deputy Cormac Devlin<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_26">I thank the Minister for sharing time and for his statement. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the roll-out of our Covid-19 vaccination programme. I thank the Minister and his ministerial colleagues in the Department of Health for all their efforts during this global pandemic. Equally, I acknowledge the tragic deaths of 3,120 people and offer my deep condolences to all those who have lost loved ones during this pandemic. Like everyone in Ireland, I am extremely grateful for the efforts of our front-line healthcare staff who have worked tirelessly and diligently to keep people safe over the past year. Just yesterday, we saw 1,335 new cases of Covid-19 confirmed, 437 of which were here in Dublin. While this represents a considerable reduction on the peak of more than 8,000 cases three weeks ago, it is still very challenging and worrying for society as a whole. Almost 1,670 people are currently in hospital, with the HSE reporting that 217 are in ICU. While our seven-day average of cases has fallen from a high of 1,322 to 249 per 100,000 people it is clear that Covid-19 continues to pose a serious danger and threat to people. Sadly, more people will die but the public health message is very clear and straightforward: stay home and stay safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> There is light at the end of the tunnel and, as we heard from the Minister, there is hope. The vaccine programme is being rolled out widely.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">The Deputy's point is made. As Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I had understood the Minister was sharing time with the Minister of State. That was my initial understanding. That is why I called on the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. However, the document on speaking time before me has the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and Deputy Devlin. That was apparently the arrangement made. I was certainly expecting the Minister of State. The points have been made but I am afraid the Deputies will have to take them elsewhere because it has been decided that each group can share time. That was the agreement. I will call on Deputy Devlin again.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">That is correct; the time is allocated by grouping. I was just saying that there is light at the end of the tunnel and there is hope with the vaccination programme well under way. As the Minister noted in his remarks, more than 143,000 vaccinations were administered up to last weekend, with another 51,000 due to be administered by this weekend. This will constitute the vast majority of nursing home residents and front-line healthcare staff. News that people over 70 years of age will start to receive their inoculations in the next two weeks is very encouraging. During the first wave, this cohort was particularly vulnerable and the worst impacted. Many such people have been cocooning or restricting their movements. News that the vaccination programme is well under way will come as a great relief to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> There is a great enthusiasm for the vaccinations. Like all of my colleagues in the House, I have been contacted by constituents looking for more information on the vaccine programme. People want to know when they are likely to be vaccinated and what the arrangements will be. The Minister has highlighted the arrangement made with GPs and pharmacists. This is very welcome. I am sure there will be further news in that regard. There is a real hunger for information among the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> Of course, all of this is subject to supply and, as the Minister highlighted in his remarks, there are issues in that regard at times and supply can fluctuate but people want a rough indication of when they will receive vaccination. I ask the Minister to ask the HSE about sending information to all homes or about a robust information campaign which might include a website and a helpline which people could ring to ask questions and get the information they desire about the vaccinations. I thank the Minister and his officials and all of the vaccination teams for the great work they are doing as part of this national effort.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I will make a very short opening statement before moving on to questions to the Minister. I have to say that his opening statement fell far short of what was needed. No timeframes or targets were given and the Minister did not revise the timeframes he had given to Deputies in this House and to the public over recent weeks. It pains me to say it but it is very difficult to retain confidence in the roll-out of the vaccination programme when we are not given the information we should be getting from the Minister for Health. He had ten minutes to set out a clear strategy that would provide people with clarity and certainty but he has not done so. He shared time with a backbencher and did not use the opportunity he was given today to give us the information we need. This is not a time for spoofing but a time for absolute clarity and certainty and a time to give assurances and reassurances to the public with regard to the roll-out of the vaccines. We need strong leadership on this issue and it once again pains me to say that we are not getting it. That is deeply disappointing.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> Two weeks ago in this Chamber, the Minister said that the initial plan was "to inoculate 700,000 people by the end of March". In his opening contribution, he failed to point out that this was based on an assumption that AstraZeneca would be certified and that a set number of doses of its vaccine would be available. This only came out after I and others put questions to him. As we now know, that has run into difficulties. The Minister has provided no timeframes at all in his opening statement so let us get to them in the questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">Does the Minister still anticipate that 700,000 people will be vaccinated by the end of March?</p>

With regard to the plan, my understanding is that is exactly what we will get into now and I will certainly endeavour to provide any answers. That is what we are here for. Hopefully, the Deputy is still getting the daily updates as I asked that every Oireachtas Member would get a daily update on the vaccination programme. We are making a big effort to keep the Deputy and colleagues as updated as possible on a daily basis. If there is more that he would like or that he thinks that we can do, please let me know because we want to keep-----</p>

          <p eId="para_51">I was responding to the Deputy’s statement, which he will appreciate we should all be able to do. As he quite rightly said, the figure of 700,000 was an effort to provide in an indicative target for the Oireachtas and it was, as he rightly referred to, heavily caveated and remains so. As the Deputy will recall from our interactions last week, I said that if we get the supply that has been tentatively agreed with the pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca - remember both last week when we were discussing this and indeed right now, this company has still not even been authorised - the target is 700,000. The talk of the first, second and third quarter up to September is all heavily caveated around being conditional on supply. As the Deputy quite rightly pointed out, there are issues with AstraZeneca which I referred to in my speech-----</p>

          <p eId="para_52">I have to ask the Minister again please to answer the question. It was a very simple, direct question. Is the figure of 700,000 by the end of March still the target?</p>

          <p eId="para_53">I am trying to answer that question for the Deputy. The figure of 700,000 was conditional on supply coming in, including from AstraZeneca. As we are all aware, AstraZeneca has, very frustratingly, signalled that it will not deliver the full amount that was anticipated. Of the 700,000, which referred to people rather than doses, included in that-----</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I am trying to answer the Deputy’s question. Included in that was an assumption for AstraZeneca of just a little bit less than 600,000 doses. Right now, the company is not committing to that 600,000 and we are in negotiations to see what we can get. The 700,000 figure is contingent on the supply that comes in, which is still under negotiation with the company.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">My reading of the Minister’s answer is that the 700,000 target may not now be met, which is exactly what he has just said. He said last week that we were expecting 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the first quarter of this year. It is obvious that is not now going to happen. There are media reports that that figure could be as low as one quarter of that 600,000. Can the Minister give the House any information today as to what the estimation is now for the first quarter of this year for the AstraZeneca vaccine?</p>

          <p eId="para_57">At the moment the conversation and negotiation is still ongoing and quite a robust set of meetings are taking place between the Commission and the company, and the relevant officials are also in touch with the company, including from Ireland. At the moment, Ireland or any other EU state, or indeed the Commission, cannot say what the final agreed amount for the first quarter up to the end of March will be.</p>

          <p eId="para_59"> On the question of family carers which I asked last week and which I have also asked in various different ways, I got four different answers as to where they will sit. I was told that they could be in group 2, group 4, group 6 and group 10. The Minister said last week that carers who work for the HSE and for private providers are in group 2. Can he give for the first time a straight and consistent answer to this question? What group do family carers sit in? They want to know, they are watching this, they are asking and lobbying all of us, and have a right to know. They are not looking to jump the queue but they simply want to know in what category they sit. Rather than getting multiple answers, which confuse people and which is not what we should be doing, can the Minister please answer that question for me? We should be providing clarity.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">I fully appreciate that I am being asked exactly the same questions. The answer is the same as last week. There is not a single cohort we can point to. Perhaps this is part of what needs further explanation. The clinical judgement from the HSE, as the Deputy said, is that those in the formal caring sector are in cohort 2 and that family carers as a group are not in any individual cohort. Different carers who are in different positions themselves may fall into different cohorts, based on age, for example, and so forth.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">That is an unsatisfactory answer. Can I point the Minister to the HSE’s own roll-out of the flu vaccine, where carers are seen as a distinct cohort, yet when it comes to this vaccine they are not, and they are concerned about that. As the Minister knows, they do an invaluable job.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> I also wish to raise the issue of people in long-term care facilities and people with disabilities and the staff who work in these facilities. I am aware, for instance, in my own constituency in Waterford, that many of the staff and residents have not been vaccinated. They are asking when will they be vaccinated.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> In my limited time remaining I also want to ask the Minister about pharmacists. I met with the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, yesterday and they are concerned about when pharmacists will, in the first instance, be vaccinated themselves, and their role in the roll-out of the vaccine. It is reported that the Minister discussed dentists playing a role yesterday at his own parliamentary party meeting. It is my understanding, however, that pharmacists have informally been told that they will not be part of the roll-out for over 70s and yet they are obviously part of the roll-out for the flu vaccine. It is ridiculous that we have 2,500 pharmacists who can play a role, with all hands to the pump, to get this done quickly. </p>
          <p eId="para_64"> I ask the Minister then to answer these questions please on pharmacists and on people with disabilities in long-term care facilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">On the first question regarding disability settings, what has been done so far and the target for last Sunday was that residents aged over 65 both in the mental health and disability long-term care settings would be vaccinated. That is being done. They are moving now on to the vaccination of the staff both in the mental health and the disability sector and this is happening this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> As to dentists, there has not been an agreement as to vaccination with them. I have asked the Department to put such an agreement in place. Dentists, as they have pointed out themselves, are clinically trained to give people injections all the time. My understanding is that there has been initial conversations between the Department and dentists.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> With regard to pharmacists, the deal is in place and they will be part of the roll-out. Exactly when and how they are brought in, as we begin to scale up from the over 70s is an operational decision for the HSE rather than a political decision and they are working through it in detail at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">They are provided publicly by the HSE. I have the figures to hand, but I will make sure the Deputy gets them. Regarding the healthcare workers, Deputy Kelly is right that I made that commitment to Deputy Duncan Smith. The HSE is working on that issue and as soon as I have the information, I will make it available to all Members.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">Surely the Minister has that information instantaneously. What sort of an organisation would not know who it has vaccinated? That information must be provided, otherwise we have bigger problems here. It does not make any sense that we do not know how many Covid-19-facing front-line workers have been vaccinated in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, or the Coombe or any other hospital in this country. It is worrying that the Minister cannot provide those statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> As I have limited time, I will ask a few other questions. Regarding the volume of people who are to be vaccinated, we now know that we will not hit the targets for March. The Minister did not say that but I am going to take it in respect of the 700,000 people. Is the Minister still of the belief that we can have every citizen in this country vaccinated by September?</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> Turning to the role of the Minister, I appreciate that he is under severe pressure. I can see it this morning and it is not something I am comfortable with, to be honest. I appreciate it. The Minister is now in charge of quarantining, vaccinations and everything else in the area of health. I do not believe that the Minister and his Department should be in charge of quarantining; it should be the Department of Justice. Does the Minister believe that all three jobs should be done from his Department? I have nothing against the Minister personally. When it comes to the volumes of people being vaccinated, does the Minister think that people over 70 years old will be reached in the timeframe which he has stated previously? Turning to the nursing homes, I implore the Minister to not forget people in other elderly residential settings, such as people in assisted living etc.. Those settings are forgotten about at times.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">I will start at the end. I agree fully that there are older residential settings which do not come under the nursing home group, so they would not naturally fall into cohort 1. Most of them will come into cohort 2, which includes those people aged over 70 years old. We are starting with those over 85 years of age. We were only discussing this topic with the HSE this week to see what could be done, because, regarding the Deputy's point, there is a higher risk of contagion among a group of older people. I thank the Deputy for making that point and we have asked the HSE to look at exactly that matter within cohort 3.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> Regarding September, as Deputy Shortall rightly pointed out to me, it is not "citizens" we are referring to but "residents", and adult residents. I will finish on this point and respond to the Deputy's other points in writing. The September figure was, and remains, if the vaccines arrive according to a provisional schedule. However, that not only includes vaccines which have not even been authorised but those vaccines for which the companies have not even applied for authorisation yet. Were those vaccines to come in, the advanced purchase agreements we have and the conditional delivery schedules would allow the vaccination of every adult resident of Ireland by September. As per last week, though, that is all entirely conditional on supply coming into the country, vaccines being authorised and even vaccine production companies applying for authorisation.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">To clarify for Deputy Kelly, normally, when the statements and questions and answers are to last 135 minutes, his group would have six and half minutes but we have 100 minutes for the session this morning. We move on now to the Government side, and I call Deputy Murnane O'Connor.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">I will ask a few questions and I would like the Minister to respond at the end. First, I acknowledge all our workers who have been working so hard throughout this Covid-19 pandemic. I have also been thinking of all those families who have lost loved ones because of Covid-19. Some 70,000 front-line workers have yet to be vaccinated, however. I have seen the concern this causes in hospitals. In my constituency, only half of the staff in St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny, have been vaccinated. Will those who have not been vaccinated be prioritised and vaccinated as soon as possible? I was also shocked to learn this week that eight residents of a nursing home in Kilkenny, living in adjacent properties, were not vaccinated, while 34 of those inside the main home were vaccinated. That is a concern. I understand the situation because I rang the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. In fairness, she responded with information stating that the situation arose in respect of those residents because they have a front door and are therefore on a separate list.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> I reiterate, however, that we need a common-sense approach to this process. It is unacceptable to send our front-line workers to vaccinate 34 people, whether those are elderly residents or carers, and not to vaccinate eight elderly people who are adjacent. I believe they are on the community vaccination programme but that is only scheduled to begin in February, subject to the approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine. I ask the Minister to respond on that issue. We were expecting 230,000 doses of that vaccine next month but it seems we will now only get 200,000 doses, with another 100,000 doses in March. How far off the expected range of delivery of AstraZeneca vaccine will we be?</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I again raise the issue of family carers, who do a marvellous job. It is important to ensure that they are on the priority list. Members of the Garda and other front-line workers also do great work, and there are many other similar groups. The main point I believe we must look at concerns information. We need an information campaign of some kind because there is such confusion surrounding the lists for vaccination. We have also seen that in respect of our disability services, which are so important. Many important sectors must be prioritised. I am trying to go by the lists we have but I believe we must look at this again. I know everyone is doing their best but I ask the Minister to look at a separate information campaign in order that we are able to go back and provide proper information, especially to front-line workers and those providing other great services.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter with me again today, as she did last week. There was confusion regarding this residential home in Kilkenny. My understanding is that there are eight houses adjacent to that home, and that they all have their own front doors. We can say that it would have been logical to vaccinate all those people at the same time. Unfortunately, however, my understanding from the HSE is that when that application was submitted for the quantity of the vaccine, those eight adjacent houses were not included. Last week, through the HSE, I tried to secure the extra vaccine for those eight adjacent locations. Unfortunately, no surplus vaccine was available then but those residents will come under cohort 3 in the category of those aged over 65 years old. I have ensured that they are on the list.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">I will respond to Deputy Murnane O'Connor in writing regarding those questions I do not get a chance to cover. Regarding the position with AstraZeneca, the European Commission is in active and pretty robust conversations with that company. Neither the Commission nor the company has yet been able to provide a firm delivery schedule for the second half of March. We are waiting on that timeline.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> Many Deputies are very fairly raising the issue of family carers. Deputy Murnane O'Connor referred to members of the Garda as well, while, rightly and reasonably, reference was made to teachers in special education and cystic fibrosis patients last week, as well as many others. What I can tell the Deputy is that the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, the expert group, thought through these issues in great detail and came up with a recommended list, which was then reviewed and endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and ultimately signed off on by the Cabinet. That is the prioritisation with which we are going but obviously we must keep these things under review.</p>

          <from>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_99">I welcome the Minister to the House, and I have some serious questions to ask him. First, I pay tribute to people working in nursing homes where people are seriously ill, to the doctors, the nurses and the families who cannot visit their relatives and who are waiting, worried and extremely distressed. I welcome any initiatives the Minister can continue to undertake to supply services where they are requested by people working in nursing homes. Those people are doing a fantastic job, and they have unbelievable commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> In Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, there is serious concern about not enough vaccine arriving. Half of those in the hospital were vaccinated but the other half were not. Yet, we read about events in the Coombe Hospital and in other hospitals where there seems to have been an abuse of the vaccination process.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">It affects credibility in the context of what is happening. There is also a report that the level of vaccination at all hospitals in the south east was 100%. Why was that not the case in the north east? I appreciate that the Minister may not have the answer now, but I would like to hear his comments on that point.</p>

        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_72" as="#Minister_for_Health">
          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_102">I wholeheartedly endorse and echo the Deputy's praise of the nursing homes and for those working in the nursing homes. I add my thanks to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who is taking the lead on nursing homes, and who is doing a fantastic job and working very closely with the nursing home sector to ensure that it gets whatever help we can give it. This is a really tough situation. Many nursing home staff are out of work because of Covid-19, either directly or indirectly. A bit of hopeful news is that the number of staff who are out has decreased in recent days. The latest figures we have show that the number went from 1,800 to 1,700, and we hope to see this continue now that the vaccination programme is being rolled out, at least with dose 1. We are now moving into dose 2.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> In the context of the specific hospital referred to by the Deputy, the roll-out is an operational matter for the HSE. The political involvement was, essentially, to set and agree the prioritisation. Cohort 2 comprises healthcare workers. Within that is a sub-prioritisation that was provided by the HSE. I will explain how it worked. In the first instance for the first few days, four hospital groups were involved in an initial roll-out, and that was widened very quickly to all of them. The volume of vaccines going to which healthcare workers in what hospitals is an operational matter determined by each hospital group. The Deputy referred to half of the healthcare workers in a specific hospital being done. That is not out of line with the total. The estimate is that the front-line healthcare worker cohort is some 150,000 people. As of last Sunday, nearly 77,000, which is about half, had been done. It will be more now because second doses have been going on this week for healthcare workers. It is the case that, based on the supply we have, nearly half of the members of that cohort across the country have been inoculated. I share the Deputy's-----</p>

          <p eId="para_106">That is not acceptable to the people who have been talking to me. I accept that the HSE is accountable but I am waiting to get an answer from it, as are many of the workers in the hospital. They are angry, concerned and frustrated. What happened at the Coombe hospital and elsewhere is not acceptable. I appreciate that this is not the Minister's fault.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> My other question is on vaccination in the community, which I am aware is to be carried out by GPs and pharmacists. Are issues relating to guidance and consent being dealt with? There may be issues regarding people's mental capacity and ability to give consent. If older, vulnerable people are in a household bubble, will the entire bubble be vaccinated or just the individual? I appreciate that I have no time left, so perhaps the Minister will ask his Department to provide the answer as soon possible.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_108">Perhaps the Minister can come back to me in writing on some of the points I will make in the short time I have. There are huge issues that will be a major factor in the vaccine roll-out, one of which is the importance of access for those in rural communities. There has been a commitment for 15 mass vaccination centres in the State. I understand the logic with regard to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine because of the temperature requirements, but as the other brands come on stream we need to have significantly more centres than currently planned. We will need at least one vaccination centre for each county. My constituency of Laois-Offaly, which is more than 90 miles in diameter, would need at least two centres to reach into those communities. A significant challenge in reaching communities in the roll-out process will be low income groups and rural areas. We need to make the process as easy and as accessible as possible to ensure that uptake is high. The more localised we can make it, the better the uptake will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> It is good that GPs and pharmacies are signed up and ready to go. However, we also need to maximise the vaccination teams through the use of public health nurses, Army medics and school vaccination teams during the summer. I ask the Minister to consider this proposal and to reply back to me on it, or perhaps have one of his officials do so. These three groups are qualified to vaccinate people, they are there and they can be utilised. The vaccination teams in schools have a great track record. The Minister knows this and I know this. We should try to utilise them. Will the Minister come back to me on that? The Tánaiste talked last night on television about having up to 1 million doses per month. We need to make sure that all hands are on deck in order to ensure a speedy and efficient roll-out of the vaccines.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> I will now address the vaccination priority list. There are many competing groups that feel they should be prioritised due their role and their vulnerability. That is a challenge but I appreciate there has to be a pecking order. This must be based on logic, science and health. I want to address just three of the groups, the first of which is family carers, a group that has been referred to already. They really need to be higher up the pecking order. They do an important job and work with people who are in a very vulnerable position.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> The second group which has been overlooked is taxi drivers who have contracts with the health services. This is a very important one. I have been contacted by a number of these people in Laois and Offaly. They transport patients between hospitals, they transport blood samples and other supplies back and forth, they bring patients to the hospitals for kidney dialysis and so on. Is the vaccination of these taxi drivers a matter that the Minister has considered? Will the Minister have his officials look at it?</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> The third group that must be considered is undertakers. They do a very hard and difficult job, and especially over the past ten months, which involves interacting with large numbers of people. It is very hard to avoid it. They do removals and funerals. They must go into nursing homes. There is a particular issue for undertakers when they go into private nursing homes. They have told us that if they go into a public nursing home the bodies are sealed in body bags, but in a private nursing this tends not to happen. An undertaker must go in and handle the body. Tragically, some of those undertakers have died having contracted Covid-19. I ask that the Minister consider the position of undertakers, who do a very important and difficult job.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> I ask the Minister to review the priority list, and that the vaccination centres are as local as possible. There will be a better reach and a better uptake. I am aware that the Minister will not have time to respond here, but will he ask his officials to revert to me on those questions?</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_77">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_114">At the outset, I must express my complete dissatisfaction at the way the Minister has dealt with his speaking slot this morning. The whole purpose of this session is that he be accountable to Members with regard to the vaccine programme. That is the purpose of these sessions every Thursday morning. It is entirely unacceptable that the Minister would give away more than half of his time to a Government backbencher. I put it to him that this is not accountability, it is avoiding accountability. We need a ruling from the Chair on that. It is not acceptable that this would happen ever again.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> There is a real problem with the Minister overpromising. He talks a great deal about the vaccine programme when in the media but he talks very little about the actual management of Covid-19. There is no opportunity for accountability on the announcement the Government made earlier in the week, which raises huge questions. There are credibility issues, and many of the proposals from the Government on quarantining are just nonsense. We must have accountability in that regard also. The restrictions are to be extended until 5 March and yesterday the Minister was asked what will happen then. His response was that we would have the vaccine. We will not have the vaccines. A very small proportion of the population will be vaccinated by 5 March. The Minister is playing two sides of this. He is avoiding accountability in respect of the management of Covid and on the roll-out of the vaccine.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> The Minister is hugely overpromising. Everybody accepts that there are serious problems with suppliers and with pinning down supply. AstraZeneca has been a disgrace in the way it is failing to meet the terms of contracts it signed. Other pharma companies are not delivering on what they promised and there is uncertainty about aspects of different vaccines, not only in supply but also in efficacy. The Minister needs to be upfront about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">He must be frank and level with people about what they are rather than overpromising, because that gives them a false sense of security. That is what happened in the run up to Christmas, when there was an overselling of the vaccine. It contributed to people letting down their guard and we know the consequences of that. I ask the Minister to be upfront and frank with people, to give us the honest figures and to stop overpromising.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> We are not getting daily updates. We are getting weekly updates, and that is not sufficient. We asked for a daily update on the number of vaccines delivered to this country and the number administered. I again ask the Minister to give a commitment to do that. What is the exact position relating to the two cohorts that are the priority, which the Minister made promises about last week and which have not been delivered? How many nursing home residents and staff have still to get the first dose? When does he expect all nursing home residents and staff to be completed with the second dose? I have the same questions with regard to front-line healthcare workers. How many of them have received their first dose? At this point, when does the Minister expect all of them to be completed with the second dose?</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> I also have a question relating to disability long-term care facilities. It is good that residents aged over 65 have been vaccinated in those facilities, but I cannot understand why staff have not been vaccinated. Why would the Minister not have the staff vaccinated, just as there is a plan to vaccinate staff in nursing homes?</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> I would appreciate it if he could answer those questions. If he does not have time, can he refer back to us as early as possible with the exact figures?</p>

It was, and remains, a genuine attempt to give people a sense of the timeline. Members were asking last week if we are talking about the start of summer, the end of summer, next year or two years hence. I said, and this continues to be the position, that if all the supplies come, these are the timelines. It is reasonable to try to give people that type of direction-----</p>

The appalling way in which the company has treated EU member states and the Union itself has been incredibly unfortunate considering the major investment the company has received in public funds from across the Union. We must ensure that it upholds its commitments to the EU. In a certain sense, Ireland is being held hostage by that situation in respect of vaccinating its population. There is a high degree of expectation on the Government and the Minister to deliver in this area. Unfortunately, however, we do not produce vaccines. A multilateral approach is required on this issue and progress on vaccination can only be achieved by member states working united together. It is important to state that.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> There is another matter I wish to raise with the Minister regarding the groups in society that have been inquiring about when they will receive their vaccination. Obviously, it is imperative that those who are most vulnerable receive their vaccinations as soon as possible, but, if it is at all possible the Government should put enormous focus, at the appropriate time, on trying to return teachers and students to full-time secondary education. Perhaps it would look at that sector and give it an increasing focus when it comes to the vaccination strategy and where it lies on the chart at present. I believe that is the only way we can return people to normality in education. There may be many bumps along the road that we have not yet encountered, but I am sure we will rise to those challenges when they arise. I have every confidence in the Minister, the Ministers of State and Department officials, who are working exceptionally hard to deal with the challenges. However, on the specific issue of getting children back into schools and students sitting State examinations properly again, we must try to get them vaccinated as soon as possible to minimise the risk to their growth and development. Ultimately, this pandemic has been a horrific incident overall for the development of children and their lives. Unfortunately, it has made a massive dent in growth and development for anybody growing up in Ireland. It has been incredibly challenging for all age groups, but particularly for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> Can the Minister give some information on his understanding of what is happening with AstraZeneca? I understand as of this morning, although the situation is constantly evolving, that the company is meeting the European Commission tomorrow, but perhaps the Minister might be able to provide the House with some information on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">I thank the Deputy for his contribution and questions. I agree wholeheartedly with him that we need to get the information to people. There is a real hunger for it, particularly with regard to people over 70 years old. They are asking how it is going to happen and when they will be contacted. That information will be out shortly and much of it will come from GPs to their patients. There will be information shortly on that. The most important thing to say is that people will know ahead of time when and how they are to be vaccinated.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> Regarding AstraZeneca, there is an ongoing, robust exchange between the European Commission and the pharmaceutical company. There has not been closure on it. There was a meeting late last night about it and there is still no agreed quantity of supply to the Commission and, therefore, to us, with the company at this point. We take 1.11% based on our population.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">I wish to delve into one element with three questions momentarily. Before that, many Members have mentioned various categories in society and their places on the list. I do not take issue with that, but I ask the Minister to provide clarity on one niche area, which is Irish citizens based abroad who are in the service of the State and when they might expect to receive the vaccine. I refer to members of the Defence Forces who are on peacekeeping missions and our diplomatic corps. A number of foreign diplomats who are based here have been called home to receive their vaccines. What is the plan for those Irish citizens who do such important front-facing work?</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> I do not wish to labour the point about AstraZeneca because Deputy O'Connor and other Members have dealt with the details, but I would appreciate if the Minister would elaborate on one of the replies he gave to Deputy Cullinane regarding what type of engagement he or his officials are having with European Commission officials or other ministers across the EU. Is there an Irish Sherpa when it comes to vaccine procurement? Perhaps he would also elaborate on the status of both the CureVac and the Janssen Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines as they go through the various processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> The Minister and Deputy O'Connor talked quite rightly about the importance of giving people clear information. I am very concerned about the deliberate misinformation that is being spread by Members, members of the media and members of the public in terms of what exactly a vaccine procurement programme is. There are glib comments that we can just abandon the EU and get the vaccines ourselves. They ask why we cannot act like Hungary and get the Sputnik V vaccine or engage with Chinese or Indian pharmaceutical companies. It is important that the Minister elaborate on the exact importance of this programme, the opportunities it presents and how isolated we would be outside it.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">That level of misinformation and disinformation is starting to seep through. People are already emailing my office asking why we cannot just throw money at the problem and get a workaround. The vaccine nationalism being pushed by certain organs in the UK media is compounding the issue. </p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_140">I thank the Deputy for his contribution. With regard to his first question on Irish citizens abroad in service to the State, I will ask for an update on that and will make sure it is brought to him. On the engagement of the State with the EU at various levels, that is absolutely happening. We are part of the process whereby the Commission is engaging with AstraZeneca and there are contacts at an official level. As well as that, we are not just engaging with but are part of the European Medicines Agency. Very serious consideration and decisions are going on there about AstraZeneca and not only are we engaging with it but we are part of that process through our own agency, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA. I assure the Deputy that the State is very much involved at the relevant levels. I have raised the issue and the Taoiseach raised it at a Council meeting last week as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> There are two issues with AstraZeneca, which are our priorities. First is maximising the supply. What we and the Commission want is for the company to deliver according to what was agreed. The second issue is getting the supply in here as early as possible. I fully agree with the Deputy that we cannot go on our own. People who are advocating that are either being deliberately mischievous or are just honestly mistaken about what Ireland as a very small country on its own would be able to procure in a very competitive global market. I will supply the Deputy with a table on this matter. Through the EU advance purchase arrangement we have pre-purchased 14.4 million vaccine doses. AstraZeneca will not disappear and we will start receiving its vaccine very soon, but even if, hypothetically, we got no AstraZeneca vaccines, of which we have pre-ordered 3.3 million, we would still have over 11 million doses of other vaccines. That is absolutely the way to go.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">I raise the matter of family carers. I have been in contact with many carers in my constituency and their stories are heartbreaking. They look after the most medically vulnerable people in the State and they feel they have been completely abandoned. One constituent of mine cares for her elderly parents, both of whom have serious medical conditions. After one of them recently visited a hospital, both now have Covid-19. Their daughter appears to have no choice other than to care for them and potentially expose herself, her partner and their family to the virus. The other option is to leave them to fend for themselves, which is not in fact an option as they are both unable to look after themselves. Where is the plan for family carers? The Minister certainly did not clear that up when he was asked about it earlier on.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> I have been contacted by many constituents who work in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, about the roll-out of vaccines. I have been told that many workers who do not have contact with patients, such as clerical workers, have received the vaccine ahead of staff who have direct contact with patients. Nobody has an issue with extra vaccines being put to good use but staff expect the priority list to be adhered to and that does not seem to be happening in that hospital at the moment. On top of this, many staff members, including those who work in paediatric wards and the maternity unit, were due to be vaccinated last Monday week and the plan was cancelled without explanation. It is 11 days on and they are still waiting for a new vaccination date. As the Minister knows, staff are already under huge strain trying to deal with enormous workloads, the stress of looking after patients with Covid and the additional pressures of other staff being absent due to sick leave. Under the Government's plan, these staff were to be prioritised for vaccination. That is clearly not happening and I am not the first to flag it with the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> The maternity unit at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is running a full service. Its staff regularly deliver babies to mothers who are Covid-positive, they are running full face-to-face antenatal clinics and they also work daily shifts in the emergency department. Not one midwife nurse has been vaccinated at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital despite the fact that County Louth has some of the highest rates of Covid in the State. Front-line workers at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital have been putting their lives at risk to look after people since last March. They are saving lives and the Minister expects them to put on their uniforms every morning and face into another difficult, stressful and sometimes heartbreaking day at work. All they are asking is to be prioritised in line with what the Minister and the Government said the plan was.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> When can family carers expect to be vaccinated and when can midwives, nurses and other front-line staff at Our Lady of Lourdes expect to be vaccinated? The Minister said earlier that vaccination was an operational matter for the HSE. That is not acceptable. He is the Minister in charge and he cannot absolve himself of responsibility in the middle of a pandemic. Will he intervene to make sure those staff, who are very scared and have to face that risk every single day, are vaccinated?</p>

          <p eId="para_147">I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy. It is quite tragic listening to all the cases for urgent vaccinations, whether for midwives, carers, ambulance drivers or people involved in funerals and so on. The reason for that tragedy is that our vaccination programme is a shambles and there are reasons for that other than the lack of vaccines. They include the underlying weakness in our public health system, the lack of a national immunisation database, and the fact that we do not have the numbers of public health doctors we require. The row over vaccination production is being cast in terms of the UK versus the EU and we should be very careful about seeing it in that way. Like many companies, AstraZeneca has form in this. It was before the European Court of Justice in 2012 in another case of abuse of intellectual property rights. I am making a very clear call today for us to move away from the idea that we have to compete with other countries and other areas of interest. Rather, we should move towards something that has been called for on a global scale by Oxfam and international human rights groups, led by India and South Africa. They are calling for a "people's vaccine", as it has become known, which would mean freeing up the intellectual property rights and agreeing that on a global scale in order that every country that has the ability to engage in the pharmaceutical industry can do so. We certainly have that ability here. Just before Christmas, People Before Profit put a motion on the Order Paper. It read:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_148">That Dáil Éireann, in view of the serious threat that Covid-19 poses to people all over the world:</p>

          <p eId="para_157">It is clear from listening to the Minister that he prefers vaccination aspirations to targets, because people can be strung along with aspirations that will not be met and because that allows him to try to avoid the fact that if we continue the living with Covid strategy, there will be more lockdowns before we achieve full vaccination. Earlier this week the Minister, unbelievably, claimed that one of the reasons we could not pursue a zero Covid strategy was because we did not know for sure that another Covid variant would not arrive that would make the vaccine ineffective. What on earth did he mean by that claim?</p>

          <p eId="para_158">I would have to go back and check exactly what interview or statement the Deputy is talking about. As he has characterised that comment right now, it does not sound right to me but I am more than happy to look at what was said on the record and engage with him on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_159">I am fairly certain it was said at the press event to announce the extension of restrictions to 5 March, etc.. If we want to reduce the chances of more dangerous mutations that could undermine vaccines getting into the country, it would make sense to pursue elimination strategies within each country and to seek to keep new variants out. This also makes sense in respect of the points made by Deputy Bríd Smith regarding a people's vaccine? By the end of this year, nine in ten people in the lesser-developed countries in the world will not have been vaccinated. That is morally outrageous in view of the fact that we have the physical capacity to produce vaccines but are prevented from doing so by intellectual property considerations. Also, it is a health risk for the entire world because there is a chance of mutation each time the virus jumps from one person to another. Is this not a reason the Government should be supporting a zero Covid strategy and a people's vaccine?</p>

          <p eId="para_160">I thank the Deputy for his questions. We are in agreement on the strategy relating to the new variants. For example, South Africa and Brazil have the identified variant. Last night, the visa programme for those countries was suspended. In the context of new variants emerging globally, I agree that we need a robust system of protection in place which will keep those variants out of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> I am out of time. I am happy to study the Deputy's proposal. For what it is worth, my own view is that Ireland and the more developed and wealthier world do have an obligation to ensure there is vaccine availability for those countries that cannot afford it. I am more than happy to engage with the Deputy further on that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">I thank the Minister, his Department and all of our front-line workers for their work and commitment during the pandemic. I have three questions for the Minister, the first of which is in regard to Johnson &amp; Johnson. There is speculation that it is about to announce that it has a vaccine suitable for dealing with Covid-19. Has the Department of Health engaged with Johnson &amp; Johnson, which has a base in Ireland, and has there been engagement by the European Commission with the company on long-term planning in respect of its vaccine?</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> I know that there are a number of groups demanding assistance in regard to vaccination at an early date. One such group is the parents, brothers and sisters of young people with intellectual disabilities who are caring for them while working full-time at home but are not getting the necessary supports. Can they be prioritised for vaccination at an early date?</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> There is clear evidence that people who have a vitamin D deficiency have fewer defences if they contract Covid-19. I took part in a Zoom conference on Monday last. One of the presentations made by a medical expert stated that vitamin D deficiency is a huge problem in the context of depression and mental health. We need to roll out a national programme advertising and promoting the use of vitamin D. In the UK, a four-month supply of vitamin D is being provided to people in nursing homes and the elderly. We need to do this. What is the Department doing in terms of the promotion of the use of vitamin D?</p>

          <p eId="para_166">I thank the Deputy for his questions. With regard to Janssen-Johnson &amp; Johnson, I will ask the Department for the most up-to-date note on it. I have heard various different accounts over the past few days on timing. I can confirm that not only are we and the EU aware of it, but that the Janssen-Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is one of the vaccines we have advance purchased in anticipation of the company applying for and securing market authorisation. We have advance purchased 2.2 million doses of that particular potential future vaccine. It is a very interesting one for two reasons of which I am aware. First, the latest information I have is that it would be a single-dose vaccine, which would be very welcome. Second, as with the AstraZeneca vaccine, it can be kept at refrigerated temperatures. A single-dose vaccine at refrigerated temperature would be very attractive. However, we do not yet have information on the effectiveness of the Janssen vaccine in clinical trials or the effectiveness of it in the field. We will be keeping a close eye on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> With regard to carers, if I understand the Deputy correctly - my apologies if I do not - he is seeking prioritisation for those caring for people with disabilities. I will get him an exact note in that regard. In the context of those with disabilities who are in long-term residential care, it includes all staffing working in long-term care and caring for those with disabilities in long-term residential care. That is happening right now. In the formal sector - the paid carer sector - the decision of the HSE was that those who are employed as carers in the sector are deemed to be front-line healthcare workers and will, therefore, be in cohort 2. If there is a subgroup in this area in respect of which the Deputy would like a little more clarity, he can let me know.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I am aware of much of the commentary on vitamin D and its potential to boost the immune system and provide protection against viruses, including Covid-19. I am happy to ask the relevant group within the Department and NPHET for a view on that and other potential opportunities in terms of public health.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jackie Cahill<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_169">I compliment the Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on their work. Mental health is a huge issue within the Covid-19 scenario, one that we cannot underestimate.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> We are in a loaves-and-fishes situation in terms of the administration of the vaccines. I propose to focus on the prioritisation of particular sectors within my community that have made representations to me. A couple of weeks ago, I was criticised in the national media for making representations on behalf of front-line workers at Nenagh hospital. As long as I am privileged to be a Member of this House, I will make no apologies for making representations in regard to the genuine grievances of my constituents. Thankfully, some of the staff have been vaccinated. It was unfortunate that other hospitals within this group received the vaccine and that Nenagh hospital was left behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> As previous speakers noted, carers need to be moved higher up the priority list. It makes no sense that the patients for whom they are caring will be vaccinated and they will not. They are an essential part of our battle against Covid and their assistance is vital to people being cared for in their own homes. We are all aware of the pressure our hospitals are under. I urge the Minister to look at the higher prioritisation of carers within the vaccination programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Teachers, SNAs and school staff also need to be vaccinated. We all want to see our schools to be reopened as quickly as possible. The Minister also needs to review where these staff are on the priority list in terms of vaccination. Pharmacists and pharmacy staff can play an important role in the roll-out of the vaccine. When there is greater availability of the vaccines, pharmacists will hopefully play a key role in administering them. Pharmacists and their staff need to be prioritised for vaccination in order that they will be able to administer the vaccines safely.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> When I was in the Chamber earlier I heard a point made about undertakers. Undertakers have to deal with people who have died from Covid and as such they are at risk of contracting the virus. As in the case of deaths from other causes, they have to meet the families and large numbers of people. Their case for higher prioritisation in terms of vaccination is overwhelming. I ask the Minister to also review their position on the priority list for vaccination. Cancer support centres and other groups that are meeting many people also have a strong case for higher prioritisation for vaccination.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> I would like to comment on the agrifood sector and veterinarians. In the spring time, veterinarians have an extremely large workload. They might have to visit up to 25 farms per day.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">They have a lot of exposure to different people. There is talk that they will be used to administer the vaccine when we have more quantities of it. Vets should be given greater prioritisation for vaccination.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Later in the spring, industries will be under pressure if there is a cluster of infections in their vicinity. Much of the focus in the past year was on meat processing facilities and the clusters that were there. We have spare capacity in that sector across the country and we will be able to deal with them if there are clusters there. We hope there will not be any such clusters as we move forward. Milk processing peaks between mid-April and 1 June. We have absolutely no spare capacity in that processing sector. I ask the Minister to look at the possibility that workers in milk processing would be prioritised for vaccination.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> I know the Minister has an awful lot of people roaring at him to prioritise them for vaccination. I am making the case for constituents of mine who, in my view, have a genuine case for priority. I ask him to look at those groups.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">First, I pay tribute to the HSE staff nationwide who have put huge effort into the vaccine roll-out programme, from the pharmacists reconstituting each phial to the nurses administering the vaccine and ensuring that the maximum number of doses of this precious vaccine are obtained, as well all the support staff. I am sure it is painstaking work and particularly stressful with the eyes of the whole country on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> My first question is what consideration has been given to parents of children with high-risk medical conditions? These include children who are immunocompromised following chemotherapy or recovering from a transplant and children with additional needs who require a high level of care. Has the Minister considered the impact on the child's well-being, the difficulty in caring for those children and the very real risk to their life if their parents were to catch Covid-19? Will there be consideration for those parents and carers to be prioritised in order to protect their children, or will they have to wait?</p>

          <p eId="para_180">That is a very important question, similar to many of the other questions, in terms of prioritisation. The prioritisation we are using was proposed by the expert group and NIAC, considered and endorsed by NPHET and then agreed by Cabinet. That is what we are using. Of course, it has to be a live document and we have to be open to updating it as we learn more. That goes without saying.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I am not an expert on viruses but one of the points made to me in terms of the type of situation the Deputy is talking about is that we do not have any information on the impact the vaccines have on transmissibility. If I understand the very reasonable question the Deputy is asking, it is whether NIAC or the expert group would prioritise, or increase the prioritisation of, the parents who are in this very difficult situation such that they would not contract the virus themselves and then give it to their child. I think that is the crux of the very important question the Deputy is asking. I will get him a written expert response because I cannot give him one. For what it is worth, one of the things that has been said to me by the experts on similar questions is that the vaccine would protect the parent from getting sick but would not necessarily protect the child because we do not know what level of impact it has on reducing transmissibility. That is just one of the considerations. However, I will get the Deputy an expert response.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">I thank the Minister. Why is antigen testing not being used for nursing home residents and staff? This issue has been raised a great deal in the media. It is a cheap way of testing. It is not foolproof but it certainly would be of great assistance.</p>

          <p eId="para_183">I thank the Deputy for another excellent question. Rapid testing, or antigen testing, is now being deployed across the healthcare settings at a significant volume as of this week. I have set up an independent expert group to report back to me very quickly on exactly the question the Deputy asked: can we deploy antigen testing in non-healthcare settings such as schools, nursing homes, workplaces, here in the Oireachtas or wherever it may be? I am looking forward to getting a view on that. The short version - I will finish on this because I know we are over time - is that the evidence on antigen testing is that it is not a good surveillance tool and that PCR is what we use for that. As the Deputy will be aware, there is now weekly PCR testing in all of the nursing homes, which is very valuable. Antigen testing is not good as a surveillance tool. The tests to date suggest it is not particularly good for mass testing and picking up non-symptomatic infections. However, apparently what it is good at and what it has been successful in - there are mixed studies from around the world but this is what has been shown, at least in some of the studies - is picking up those who have a higher viral load and are more contagious. I am looking forward to hearing back from the expert group as to where we could, and how we would, deploy exactly what the Deputy has suggested.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_184">I have a number of questions for the Minister. The questions are coming from people in my constituency who are asking when they may be vaccinated. They include, for instance, people who have cystic fibrosis and their carers, people with Down's syndrome and their carers, people who are on dialysis and people who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. People in those four groups have been on to my office wondering whether they can be brought forward up the chain of command.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> Ability West in Galway sent a submission to me which I forwarded on to the disability matters committee. The organisation is seeking a vaccination plan for its service users, their carers and their families. The people in Ability West are willing to help and engage, they have the expertise, they have the staff available as trained vaccinators, they have locations for vaccination and they have a strong network and community of disability services ready to help across the entire sector. We need to vaccinate people with disabilities, both those over and under 65 years of age, regardless of where they live. We need to vaccinate all staff in the disability services, including section 38 and section 39 organisations and all the HSE-delivered services. We also need to vaccinate family carers who are taking on the key worker role.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> I have two further comments to make before I ask the Minister for a response. The first relates to firefighters. I read with interest during the week - I do not know whether it is true - that Dublin firefighters have been vaccinated on foot of an intervention by the Lord Mayor of Dublin. Firefighters living in Galway East, in Tuam, Athenry, Gort and Loughrea, do the same work. They are first responders. When will all of them be vaccinated?</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> Finally, we have had much discussion about people coming into the country. I understand the Taoiseach told his party last night that 800 people arrived into Dublin yesterday, 397 of whom were returning from holiday. If that is still happening when we are trying to curtail and eliminate a deadly virus, questions have to be asked about how we are patrolling and controlling the exits and entries from and into this country. I ask the Minister to comment on the points I have raised.</p>

        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_110" as="#Minister_for_Health">
          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_188">I thank the Deputy for his questions. As with other Members and people across the country, he is rightly raising issues for those who are more vulnerable, including people with CF, people with underlying conditions such as Down's syndrome and their carers. If the Deputy looks through the prioritisation, he will see that one of the groups we are coming to as quickly as possible is people with certain underlying medical conditions. With regard to their carers, the position at the moment is that if the carers are in paid employment, as many are, they are deemed front-line healthcare workers and are being vaccinated at the moment. They are part of cohort 2. Indeed, as referred to by the Deputy, for long-term residential care settings for disability, including section 38 and section 39 organisations, residents over 65 and the staff are included in cohorts 1 and 2. They are part of the plan at the moment. Residents over 65 have been vaccinated and the staff are being vaccinated now. They are being prioritised now.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> Forgive me if I have the details wrong, but if there is a particular disability community group that the Deputy is referring to, there are two things the group can do. It can engage directly with the HSE centrally, because these are operational matters for the HSE. Alternatively, a local group could engage with the local hospital group. That would be the place to go because that is where those operational decisions are being made. I would certainly be happy to facilitate that if it was helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> I wish to make a point with regard to the firefighters. I cannot speak for the Lord Mayor or the particular incident; I have no knowledge of it whatsoever. However, there is an important principle we have to protect with the vaccination roll-out. There cannot be political interference by me, any Member or any elected politician. Our role is to set policy. We have done that by signing off on the prioritisation schedule recommended by the national immunisation advisory committee and endorsed by the national public health emergency team. After that, the distribution according to policy is an operational matter for the HSE and there should be no political interference in that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> Certainly, at a policy level it is our job to ensure that the policy is right and appropriate. I can offer an example relating to the current prioritisation. One task I have asked NPHET to look at is a profile of those who have been hospitalised with Covid-19. A look at those profiles is one proxy for those most at risk. We can then map that against the prioritisation to ensure the prioritisation does indeed cover those who are getting very sick and being hospitalised by Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> There are different firefighters in different areas. Obviously, those responsible are looking at paramedics and they may indeed be looking at the firefighters themselves. Again, each of the hospital groups is putting detailed plans together and will communicate them, as they have been doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> I agree with the Deputy on holidays. Right now, there is meant to be no non-essential foreign travel and no non-essential domestic travel beyond 5 km either. The Cabinet agreed on Tuesday to a range of significant additional measures to clamp down on exactly the issue raised by him.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_194">I intend to use my four minutes to make statements. Then, in his wrap-up at the end of the session, the Minister might address my comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> I am here as a Member of Dáil Éireann for Cork North-West. I am here because of events that took place 100 years ago and I pay tribute to those who were in Tureengarriffe on this morning 100 years ago. My community and family were closely involved in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> We have fierce challenging times in respect of Covid-19 and with the management of the vaccine. Yesterday, Deputy Canney attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters. We raised the issue of people with disabilities. I have had engagement with some of the section 38 and section 39 organisations. Representatives of these organisations have been speaking about those aged over 65 in residential care getting the vaccine. However, they have to be taken to centres for vaccination. In one incident people had to be taken to Cork city, which is several miles away from the organisation - I do not wish to mention it by name.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> I believe there should be a facility for people who are long-term residents in section 38 or section 39 organisations to be vaccinated on-site. This should apply to all of the staff who need to be vaccinated as well agency staff. Many people who are working for these organisations throughout the country are agency staff. They need to be considered and we need to try to ensure that it is possible to have vaccination on-site. I understand the challenges, the question of the loaves and fishes and that everyone is trying to do their level best to get to the right people in the first instance. However, I believe that people with a disability should be prioritised and should be looked at as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> I have seen comments tweeted since this debate started in respect of pharmacies and getting the vaccines rolled out as fast as possible. That is highly commendable. We need a sense of urgency. The difficulty is that there is divisiveness in respect of the vaccine. We understand what is happening right across the world and with Europe and AstraZeneca and so on. The reality is that we have to be seen to prioritise vulnerable people and do what we can in the right way for the vaccination programme. We have to ensure that those who are less well off, the vulnerable, carers, home helps, those providing essential services for the care of elderly people and those with intellectual disabilities are looked after as fast as humanly possible. The Joint Committee on Disability Matters reiterated these points yesterday. We have been contacted and briefing documents have come back. We welcome this and we ask that we are continuously kept briefed as a committee on what is happening. We want to be informed as we make decisions. I call on the Minister to bear those points in mind. We need to ensure that our less well off are being prioritised and that there is a clear pathway for the vaccine as we go into what we hope will be an accelerated vaccine programme. It should allow everyone to get some breathing space from this horrific pandemic that has beset the country during the past 12 months.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">I wish to clarify that there will be no concluding remarks section for the Minister. We will move on to Deputy Marc MacSharry.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarcMacSharry" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Deputy Marc MacSharry<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_200">I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to make some points. Like Deputy Moynihan, I will simply make a statement and ask that the Minister take the points on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> I want to make three points. The Minister made the point that our role is to make policy. Our role is a little more than that. Our role is to provide leadership in what is a difficult time. It must be reflective of the front-line workers whether they be cashiers or shelf packers in retail outlets, our heroic healthcare professionals or front-line gardaí. That part is missing somewhat. I understand the difficulties of the Minister with the loaves and fishes side of it, and I will deal with that in a moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> The second issue is communications. There are too many cooks. We have the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach trying to get a message out. We have the Tánaiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, throwing in a well-timed torpedo now and again. We have 30 members of NPHET, all with their own individual media careers at this stage plus the nightly announcement of figures and so on. We have approximately 30 other medical academics and professionals on media. We have Deputies, commentators and journalists. This is adding to the polarisation of society. It is adding to the anxiety that all of us have in the context of this ongoing nightmare. It needs to be addressed. I was saying this to the Taoiseach even before he became Taoiseach. I said it last night at our meeting and I am putting it on record today. The Minister needs to control the narrative with the truth and not have anyone with a profile adding or deducting from that in a Government setting. It should come from the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach rather than others, for example, 30 members of NPHET and 30 academic qualified people, adding or deducting from the facts of the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The Minister said NIAC decides. Last week, I read into the record an email relating to NIAC and a transplantee. It was crystal clear and I will provide the email to the Minister later today. NIAC said it does not determine who is on the list. That is a problem. As a result, all of us in public life at the moment are getting email after email, call after call, text after text and social media message after social media message asking about this group or that group. They are all worthy. The transplantees are a major group. These people have had to cocoon, along with their families, for obvious reasons, since last March. They do not know where they are. This morning we heard from the Irish Association of Funeral Directors. Undertakers have no choice but to go in and out of various houses to care for the deceased and their families. They have no visibility on what the situation will be. We need to be far clearer about that but I am afraid there is ambiguity around it.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> The third point relates to vaccine supply. Again, I have said every week that Europe has failed us on this. Anecdotal evidence suggests we were coming to the queue late because we put our European eggs into one basket. We put them into the development of a French vaccine that has not yet materialised. We came late to the queue with Pfizer and Moderna and later again with AstraZeneca. This suggests that, in what was a fraught Brexit negotiation environment, we were passively leaving anything associated with Britain until last.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Last night - I know it is in the media today - I made unfortunate comments that I immediately withdrew, and I apologise again for any offence that was caused, but the point is a real one. Wherever there is a viable vaccine that is safe and available, we need to be at the table. I might not like the idea personally of dealing with Russia on products, but if they have a vaccine that is safe, let us talk to them. The UAE has approved its vaccine. Hungary seems to have gone off and tried to do a unilateral deal. Whoever has a vaccine to put an end to this misery, we want their assistance and we want to be at the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> Finally, whether the number of vaccinations is 40,000 per week at the moment or the 100,000 per week speculated by the Tánaiste yesterday evening, we are looking at a full year of this. A full year of lockdowns is not acceptable and, therefore, we must look at seriously limiting North-South access, other than to those who have to have it, and seriously limiting who can come into and leave the country in order that, within the country, when we flatten the curve, we can get back to some level of normal life in the interest of the mental health of our entire nation.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">Yes, two and half minutes each, and that includes our questions and answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Early years preschool and afterschool services are currently finding it very difficult. The providers are essential workers who have been asked to keep their premises open to look after children of essential workers and vulnerable children. A 28-page document came out yesterday stating that the services to be opened are getting funding, yet other services that are closed are getting the same funding. They cannot survive at 70% capacity. The cost is the same. They are very concerned as to how to keep themselves safe. They are not included as a priority group for Covid vaccination, even though they are front-line workers. I wish to highlight their legitimate concerns. I was contacted by 38 groups in Limerick city and county. They are looking at opening communications; not a hurried email on a Friday evening telling them they have to remain open for front-line workers. Communication is key. Surely other families could also avail of the services. It is not sustainable to operate at their current capacity. Crèches have been in contact with me stating they are operating at 20% capacity. Some crèches have only five or six children where they previously had 50. As it stands, those businesses are not sustainable. One preschool owner is waiting to see whether they will get their ECCE payment. They do not know if they will get it. This goes for all services. They still have the same overheads. They will be unable to open next Monday if this payment is not made.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> PPE gear is another major issue. While the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, said there was no cut to PPE gear, schools are closed and crèches and early education services, which are open, have been given no funding for PPE since last June. I now call on the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, to do his job and turn the childcare sector into a safe place to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> The Minister for Health is always saying he would like to simplify and explain to us how things work. Let us say I am self-employed and I go into a shop tomorrow morning looking for a sandwich that costs €1. Let us simplify it. If I have 70 cent, I do not get that sandwich, or else the person who owns the shop has to take on the loss of the difference. Anyone who is keeping his or her premises open for front-line workers needs to be represented and paid 100%.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">It is mainly questions I have. I would like a bit more time but I do not have latitude for statements. I asked the Minister last week about the urgent need to offer the vaccine to home helps in west Cork and throughout the country. In his answer, he promised to furnish me with more details as to when this may be offered but as of yet I have had no information. Could he give us any update? Home helps, as he knows, are working with the patients one-to-one and, in some cases, washing them. It is not something they can do in a socially-distanced situation, so it is vital they be offered the vaccine.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">I thank the Minister. I would greatly appreciate that being furnished to us and getting some timeline. I have also had numerous queries from, as he mentioned, carers, pharmacists and part-time fire brigade personnel, who have a huge issue because they are attending home fires and accidents on roadsides and have not been offered the same as the elderly and undertakers. I suppose there is a clatter of them out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals is a registered company in Ireland and has headquarters in the Liffey valley area of Dublin. Has the Taoiseach spoken to the CEO of the company to establish when Ireland will obtain the vaccines? If not, why not? Surely Irish citizens deserve answers. The time for allowing EU bureaucrats to dictate when an elderly Irish citizen gets vaccinated has passed, and this is beyond incompetence on the part of the Government. This is an extremely serious situation and leadership must be shown. Are the delays due to the EU being slow to place an order? Given that the AstraZeneca vaccine is only a tenth of the price of others available, why did the EU hold off on ordering? It now looks like Northern Ireland and Great Britain are most likely to be back to some kind of normality in the next three to six months, way ahead of the Irish Republic. We have people coming in. I raised this issue a number of months ago with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and asked that he make sure that PCR tests were done in the airports, and that was denied to me. Now we are talking about an all-Ireland approach. The sad thing is that in Northern Ireland they cannot agree among themselves, so I cannot understand how we will get some kind of agreement with the Northern Ireland Government. However, we certainly could have controlled our own airports and we failed to do so month after month. It is not a matter of stopping people coming in here; it is to ensure they have PCR-----</p>

I ask the Minister to forgive me if I do not use my two and a half minutes to table questions for answer but I wish to make a few comments in the context of openness and accountability, the importance of which I am sure he very much appreciates. He made a speech today. He did not use his time. He did not share it with the Minister of State. I would have thought this was the perfect time to bring an element of openness and accountability into the title of this, which is the vaccination programme. It is absolutely - I will put it mildly - unfortunate that the Minister did not use his time to do that because I am on record many's the time as saying I have worked with the Government on draconian legislation in return for maximum information. We did not get that today. In fact, the Minister used his time again to acknowledge the wonderful work being done by the front-line staff, which I absolutely agree with. Let us put that aside, though. Let us acknowledge that and deal with issues and let us have reasons. The Minister failed to use his speech to deal with practical issues such as the problems with spare vaccines and how they were used - I would have liked him to have dealt with that - and vaccines having to be discarded because they were incorrectly stored. He gave us figures, which are very welcome, but he did not put them in the context of how many front-line staff and residential staff are still waiting. That would have been very helpful to us in then working through the figures and working with him in what is a pandemic that is absolutely threatening to our health and our lifestyle. I am really angry that this is what has happened today and that the Minister chose not to use his time.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> It is quite clear that he believes vaccines are the only game in town. I would have thought vaccines were just part of an overall programme. I would prefer if there were a zero Covid strategy. I agree with my colleagues on the left that that is what we should aim for and that vaccines should be a part of that. I would have thought the Minister would have come in here today and told us about the vaccine contracts. What have we signed up to? How much money have we given? He had an extraordinary sentence in his speech: "Private sector innovation has merged with public sector investment ... to ensure the speedy development of safe and effective vaccines." What we have ensured, certainly, is the production of vaccines at a huge profit to the companies. It would be very helpful if we had copies of the contracts and details of the indemnity. How much money has been put in? The Minister has chosen to do none of these things, so it is difficult to have trust. Most of all, there is no overall plan with vaccines as part of that strategy.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">I have time only for a statement. I raised with the Minister a few weeks before Christmas the need for a separate Minister or Department or part of a Department, or a separate and unique voice, in the overseeing of the roll-out of the Covid vaccine. While my suggestion was met not quite with derision, nonetheless there was a strong sense of we know what we are doing, that we do not need a separate Department or section to deal with what I then described as the single most important piece of work this Government will undertake during its time in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">From a human perspective, our response in rolling out the vaccine matters more than anything. From a political perspective, it will be the benchmark by which this Government is judged. As Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly already has a significant workload. Twelve months ago, nobody could have foreseen the unthinkable challenge that would be faced by the healthcare system. It is not possible for one person to manage healthcare and be in charge of the vaccine roll-out. What I am saying is not personal or political; it is practical. I refer to the putting in place of a national plan to facilitate the macro picture and the micromanagement that is needed as well as the detailed planning that helps to ensure confidence, buy-in and belief in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> A few weeks ago, I raised the issue of Sligo University Hospital, where there has been real concern about those who got the vaccine, those who did not and when the latter group will get it. Such concerns are repeated throughout the country. A significant part of the problem is the lack of full transparency with regard to detailed planning. Many people, especially those on the front line, are on edge. Any hint of unfairness, injustice or queue-jumping feeds the sense that we are not in this together. The only way to combat this is by appointing a chief vaccinating officer or other person who would be the face and voice of a vaccine roll-out. That person could be the Minister or others could take on board some of the responsibility, but we desperately need a single face and voice to reassure people.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">Mar gheall ar pholasaí Fhine Gael agus Fhianna Fáil, ní bheidh a dteach féin ag mórchuid oibrithe ar fud an Stáit. Oibríonn na daoine seo go dícheallach agus go crua. Chíonn siad ó thuairisc na seachtaine seo nach bhfuil toil pholaitiúil ag an Rialtas le luach na dtithe seo a ísliú. Tá an gnáthduine fágtha ar leataobh gan teach ar phraghas réasúnta le fáil acu. Tá an dóchas imithe ag na hoibrithe agus na teaghlaigh seo go mbeidh a dteach féin acu. Is ar an Rialtas atá an locht.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> This week, the Society of Chartered Surveyors released the Real Costs of New Apartment Delivery 2020 report. The report reveals the full development and purchase costs of residential housing developments in Dublin and its commuter belt for last year. For workers and families looking to buy or rent an affordable home, it made for very grim reading. The cheapest apartment detailed in the report was €359,000. To buy that, a working couple would need to have a deposit of €36,000 and a gross income of over €90,000. The cheapest apartments in Dublin city centre cost a staggering €439,000. To buy that property, a couple would need a deposit of €44,000 and a gross salary of €112,000. The Tánaiste knows as well as I do that these prices are beyond the reach of the vast majority of workers and families in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> Under the watch of Fine Gael in government, the price of homes has risen so high that working people on good incomes can no longer afford to buy their own home. That is the reality. An entire generation of workers has been locked out of home ownership. That is why 70% of the apartments outlined in the report of the Society of Chartered Surveyors are not even for sale. They are being developed for a build-to-rent market, snapped up by institutional investors, vulture funds or so-called cuckoo funds that are exploiting the scarcity of housing to turn over massive profits. They have been aided and abetted in doing so by a tax regime brought in by a Fine Gael Government that gives them the upper hand over workers and families. The rents they charge are excessive and a disgrace. In Dublin suburbs and the commuter belt, rents now range from €1,800 to €2,000 per month. Here in Dublin, a month's rent will set a renter back between €2,200 and €2,600. If ever there was proof of how broken our housing system is, this is it.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> The Tánaiste said that he would stand up for those who got up early in the morning to go to work. What about the hard-working people, especially young people, who get up every morning but cannot afford to rent or buy a home? They are paying huge rents and cannot afford a home, or they are forced to live far away from their work and families, condemned to spend hours making the long commute to work, day in and day out. There is another cohort of people who are living at home with their parents. This is not only an issue in Dublin but is repeated throughout the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> The former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, repeatedly promised to deliver 6,200 affordable homes by 2021. Not one of those has been delivered; not one. Does the Tánaiste accept that Fine Gael's housing policy has failed these families? Does he accept that proposals brought forward by Fine Gael have fuelled this issue? What is he going to do to deliver affordable homes for working people who want to rent or buy?</p>

          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_232">I thank the Deputy. All of us in this House acknowledge that the cost of housing in Ireland is far too high, particularly for those who want to buy their first home. Those costs are very high relative to people's incomes. That is particularly so in the cities, especially in central Dublin to which the report referred to by the Deputy relates.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> I note that the whole premise of the Deputy's question was to compare the housing record of my party in government with his party's record. It is fair that we do exactly that. When it comes to housing, Sinn Féin is for it in principle but always seems to be against it in practice. Its record, whether in Northern Ireland or in local authorities in this State, is very poor when it comes to providing social housing, keeping rents down and permitting builders to build houses that people need to buy.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> What is the solution? More social housing is, of course, a part of the solution. More social housing benefits everyone, not only people who are on the housing list, but also people who are renting in the private sector because it helps to bring down the general cost of housing for those who do not qualify for social housing. That is why we need to build much more of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> Deputy Doherty mentioned Deputy Eoghan Murphy. In 2019, the last year in which he was the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, we added 6,000 units to our social housing stock. North of the Border, where Sinn Féin is in government and has been for 13 of the last 20 years, much less social housing has been provided on a <i>per capita</i> basis. Sinn Féin provided less social housing than Deputy Eoghan Murphy in 2019. That is Sinn Féin's record and that is a verifiable fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> When it comes to private housing, we need to build more of that because people need homes to buy and people in Ireland want to own their own homes. That is true of 65% or 70% of people and we want to make that a reality for as many people as we can. However, Sinn Féin representatives on local authorities across Ireland vote against zoning land for housing, housing developments, social housing and mixed housing of all sorts. That is particularly verifiable in Dublin City Council and other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> We have the help-to-buy scheme which Sinn Féin is against. That scheme is there to help people with their deposits, allowing them to reclaim some of the income tax they have paid in previous years. Sinn Féin has consistently opposed that but it has helped thousands of people to get their deposits together and buy their first home.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> We also have rent pressure zones which were brought in to moderate and control rents. While they have not brought rents down, they have been successful in slowing rent inflation, ensuring that in many parts of the country the maximum rent increase is 4% and, in many cases, is much lower than that. Contrast that with Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland, where it voted to increase rents. These are the facts. Sinn Féin built fewer social houses in 2019 than Deputy Eoghan Murphy did as the Fine Gael Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. Sinn Féin votes to increase rents in Northern Ireland. It opposes the building of new homes on local authorities across Ireland. Sinn Féin would make a bad situation much worse.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">Seriously, what planet is the Tánaiste living on? It is time for him to get his head out of the sand. The Tánaiste has been in government for ten years. The Tánaiste was Taoiseach for a period of that time, yet he tries to blame everybody else for this issue. That does not wash. The reality is that this is his housing crisis. It costs €439,000 to buy the cheapest apartment in Dublin city. Under his Governments over the past ten years, people are paying rents of up to €2,600 per month, yet the Tánaiste wants to blame everybody else. He knows the facts fine well. Sinn Féin has not opposed a single social or affordable housing development in Dublin. Contrast that with the Tánaiste's councillors who have voted against thousands of social and affordable housing schemes in Clondalkin and Tallaght. That is the reality of it. The Tánaiste has been told time and time again that some of the policies that he has introduced are fuelling house prices. Do not take Sinn Féin's word for it. The help-to-buy scheme has been attacked by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which stated it will push up house prices and that is exactly what it is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Look at the shared equity scheme that the Government is introducing. The most senior civil servant in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said that the scheme is about lining the pockets of developers.</p>

It has been in government on this island longer than my party has in the past 20 years. Sinn Féin is a party of government, an establishment party north of the Border. When it comes to social housing, its record is not good. It built fewer social houses in Northern Ireland in recent years than we have added to the social housing stock south of the Border, certainly since 2016. Sinn Féin increased local authority rents in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin councillors did that and cannot blame anyone else for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">Before I get on to the main issue I want to ask the Tánaiste a question. The Minister for Health was in the Chamber earlier. I asked him how many vaccines were brought into the country this week. He said 48,000. He is wrong. According to figures given to a number of journalists, in particular Craig Hughes, who has published them in the past few minutes, it was 23,570. How can a Minister come into the House and not know how many vaccines came into the country this week? Will the Tánaiste please address that with the Government? It is scary, very scary, as was the Minister's performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> The Tánaiste is on record as saying he does not believe in zero Covid. I do not believe in the phrase "zero Covid" myself, but I do believe in the tenets of it. I believe in an aggressive national suppression strategy. Let us be frank. I am trying to be constructive. The Government has made many mistakes during this crisis. The Opposition has also made mistakes. There is no point in going through them. We all know. It is a case of hands up on all sides. We now know the vaccine will not be the panacea for 2021 that we thought it would be. It is going to take much longer, so we need to work on suppressing the virus. The Taoiseach has said it will be a long-term suppression strategy. I want to get to the point of distinguishing the difference between the Government's long-term strategy and what many of us in the Opposition are saying. We need to give people a chance of some form of normality in 2021, whether it is for funerals of close family members, which I have experienced myself recently, weddings, community, sport or getting the hospitality sector back up and running. I believe the public are ahead of us. Conor McMorrow's report on "Prime Time" last Tuesday night was the straw that broke the camel's back. We saw flights coming in from a number of destinations, but Lanzarote in particular. We heard they were full of Irish people. Everybody is making such sacrifices. The public are ahead of us and they want us to suppress the virus. As part of that, they want to see people being quarantined when they come into this country, not the half-baked strategy that is there already. We must also have a strategy for the Border - I believe the Government has taken on board some of our suggestions in that regard - and also on managing airports. Then, panzer-like, we can focus in on where the virus is in the community and suppress it. With the vaccines coming, we then give an opening to this country and bring back people's civil liberties and what they are allowed to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">I thank the Deputy. I welcome the constructive suggestions that have come from the Labour Party in recent weeks. He is right; neither the Government, the Opposition, any government, NPHET nor any expert has got everything right when it comes to managing this pandemic. What we all hope is that when this is over we will have been seen to have got most things right most of the time. I know the Deputy does not like the term zero Covid. Labour is proposing a different strategy, which is that of aggressive suppression. I think that is a term that is often used in Australia to describe the strategy in some states there. We do need to move away from slogans to the actual detail as to what different strategies mean. As I mentioned yesterday, if one asks supporters or advocates of zero Covid, it means different things to different people. For some people it is a long, hard lockdown to get to zero community transmission for 14 days in a row. For others, one does not have to get to zero at all; it is just about best endeavours to get there. For some, it is all about mandatory hotel quarantine at ports and airports. For others, it is about many other things. I agree with some things such as aggressive test, trace and isolate, mass antigen testing and others I do not agree with such as a <i>de facto</i> hard Border between North and South, preventing people from moving north and south or turning some of our Border counties into buffer zones. However, I do think there needs to be a detailed debate and discussion on these issues. We need to talk about the practicalities and we also need to talk about the pros and cons. Nobody should enter any discussion or debate on these matters by ruling out any strategy or dismissing or rejecting any proposals or suggestions. That is very much my approach and that of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> As Deputy Kelly will be aware, our strategy now is to get Covid levels down. We want to get numbers down as low as is possible. I do not know how low that is, but as low as is possible between now and 5 March. That then will allow us to click back in with our testing and contact tracing to keep a handle on the virus so that it does not slip out of our control once again. In that period, we do want to bring about the phased reopening of schools, starting with children with special and additional needs, for reasons that people understand. During that period as well, we are cracking down very severely on international travel. International travel is already down 97%. We already require people entering the country to have a negative PCR test result. If they do not have that, they will be subject to mandatory hotel quarantine. People coming from high-risk countries such as Brazil and South Africa are going to be subject to mandatory hotel quarantine whether they have a negative test result or not. It is our intention to expand that, as we develop the capability and capacity to do so. We do not have that now, but we are building it up and it will allow us to extend mandatory hotel quarantine more widely as the weeks go on.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">I welcome the fact that the Tánaiste said he is not stuck on one policy or one strategy and that he is open to looking at what I and others are proposing now. I predict he will end up coming closer to us. I do not say that everything I say is 100% the way to go, but we are willing to work with the Government to ensure the best strategy. The public have had enough. We cannot go through 2021 the same way as 2020, with the numbers going up and down. When we get the numbers down, we have to keep them down.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> In fairness to the Tánaiste, in recent days he said we have to save the summer holidays, there will possibly be no travel at Christmas, yet on 4 March we will exit to level 4. His position has moved. What I am saying quite clearly is that through a suppression strategy based on bringing in the legislation and the quarantine infrastructure and doing all that I said, and more, we can get to that point and keep it there. I know the Tánaiste likes to be on the right side of an issue and of history.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">We may well end up in the same place. There are many things that we have done in the past year to fight this pandemic that I never thought we would do. The Government and I will always keep an open mind on these things. We may not be as far apart as people may think. When we have a discussion like this, in slogans, it misses the detail. This is the complexity of what we have to deal with and there are a number of things that we will have to do to defeat the pandemic. There is no silver bullet or single action that will make it all right this summer. Unfortunately, that is not a promise that anyone can make or keep.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Our strategy is to suppress the virus, to get as low as we can go over the next couple of weeks, to roll out and speed up vaccination because that will change the picture- again, it is not a panacea, but it will change the picture considerably - and for us only to open up where it is safe and sustainable to do so. We do not want to go to level 4 on 5 March only to have to go back again three or four weeks later. That is the very strong demand from the public now. They want to know that if we are going to ease restrictions on 5 March or whenever, that it will be sustained.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">I must go back to the issue of capacity in our hospitals and to a question I put to the Taoiseach previously that he refused to answer. I refer to the closure of St. Brigid's hospital, Carrick-on-Suir, a wonderful facility that is over 200 years old. HIQA has deemed it unsuitable. However, it was deemed suitable for use as a Covid-19 hospital by HIQA at the beginning of the pandemic. If it was deemed suitable for Covid patients, how is it not suitable now for providing respite and palliative care? It is a 14-bed hospital, with three palliative care beds and wonderful staff. The hospital has enjoyed huge buy-in from the community and huge support. Indeed, much of the equipment in it was provided by local community fundraising efforts in three counties, namely, south Tipperary, south Kilkenny and east Waterford. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, has refused to meet Councillors Kieran Bourke and David Dunne, the action committee or the staff, the excellent nurses and doctors associated with the hospital. She has point-blank refused to meet them. I ask the Tánaiste, as a member of a partnership Government, to ensure that the Minister of State meets the people to whom I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> I have received a letter from the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who is a neighbour from down the road. Her own constituents use this hospital, which flies in the face of what she is doing. The letter states that another wonderful facility, St. Theresa's hospital, Clogheen, and nursing homes have been booked for step-down and respite care but that is simply untrue. Last Thursday, Covid patients were admitted to St. Theresa's hospital, Clogheen, and all other patients were moved out, under the supervision and management of its wonderful matron, Ms Walsh, and her team. There have been no negotiations with private nursing homes. </p>
          <p eId="para_282"> We are told that a new hospital would cost €5 million to €6 million and I want that examined. I want an independent arbitrator to evaluate what is wrong with St. Brigid's and how much it would cost to put it right in order to reach HIQA standards. This was done in Clogheen two years ago. An excellent job was done, with six-bed wards converted to four-bed wards. There is room for an extension on site and there is also room to build a new hospital on site. </p>
          <p eId="para_283"> The Minister of State refers to a diabetic clinic in St. Brigid's but a huge monstrosity has already been built by the HSE. It is meant to be a primary care centre but it is not functioning properly. It is two-thirds empty and a diabetic clinic could be located there. I want answers from the Tánaiste today. The people want to know how much it would cost to make the hospital HIQA-compliant. Other hospitals that got worse reports from HIQA were commandeered for Covid-19 and have now reverted to normal hospitals. There is something vindictive going on with regard to St. Brigid's. The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, must meet the staff and the action committee to explain what is happening. Something is not right here. We are not getting the full truth or even half of it. This is an excellent facility and the palliative care beds therein are badly needed. There are only two palliative care beds in Clogheen and none at all in Clonmel. Palliative care beds are badly needed in the south east of Tipperary. Clogheen is now off the radar because it is being used as a Covid-19 step-down facility. St. Brigid's in Carrick-on-Suir was available for that purpose but the HSE decided to close it in the middle of a pandemic. Talk about iillogical. This strange and bizarre decision is totally unacceptable and it will not be accepted.</p>

          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_284">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. In terms of the overall picture on hospital capacity, everyone acknowledges that we are doing so much better now than has been the case for a very long time. January is usually a period when our hospitals have no spare beds and when we hear every morning about hundreds of people being forced to spend some of their hospital stay on trolleys. As of today, for example, we have 400 to 500 beds free across our system. There were 121 patients on trolleys this morning but mainly for clinical reasons. In Clonmel this morning there is nobody on a hospital trolley awaiting admission to a bed. The Deputy will know how different that is from the experience that we have often had at this time of year in our hospitals. That is down to the winter plan, the additional bed capacity in our hospitals and in the community and the amazing work of the staff in our hospitals and across our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> I do not have an up-to-date note on St. Brigid's with me but I know the Deputy has raised it previously. My understanding is that it was closed to overnight patients because it did not meet HIQA standards but it will continue to be developed as a healthcare hub for the area, including a diabetic clinic which the Deputy mentioned, as well as primary and community care. I will get more information on it for the Deputy and will let the Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, know that he has raised it again in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> There is one final thing I wish to say before finishing up. I want to recognise the very considerable milestone that was reached yesterday, namely, that 3 million polymerase chain reaction, PCR, tests have been carried out in Ireland since the pandemic began. That is more tests per head than many of the countries with which we are often compared like Germany, Finland and Australia. I congratulate everybody working in our testing system in the laboratories, swabbing centres and in management in back offices, for having reached that considerable milestone. They deserve to be congratulated for that.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">I do not know why the Tánaiste cannot answer the question I asked. I accept that he does not have up-to-date information on St. Brigid's but I asked why a hospital that was deemed to be suitable for Covid patients last March was deemed unsuitable for any overnight patients in November. That is a simple question. I also ask that Ministers and the HSE stop sending out letters that are untrue. I do not want to use the word "lies" but it is untrue to say that Clogheen is available because it has now been designated as a Covid hospital, which is a pity.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> The Tánaiste spoke about trolleys and referred to the national figures. I salute those on the front line, including the nursing staff and deplore the way they have been blackguarded with regard to vaccines and so forth. However, the hospitals are empty or have capacity because the fear of God has been put into the people by RTÉ and by the Tánaiste himself. He appeared on Claire Byrne's show the other night and told the people that they are going to be locked up forever. Fear has been instilled in people, which is having an effect on their mental health. That is why the hospitals do not have people in them like every other year. People are afraid of their lives. They cannot go to their GPs in my area and can only speak to them over the phone. They are sent straight in for a Covid test, which is why we have such a high number of tests. Fear is stalking the land. That is why the hospitals have spare capacity, although I am glad they have capacity. That said, the Government wasted eight or nine months when it did not build additional ICU capacity.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">People have good reason to be afraid. This pandemic is real. There are 3,000 families across the country who have lost loved ones and are still grieving for them. Had it not been for the actions that people took individually and as a community, as well as the actions that Government took, we would be experiencing much higher levels of mortality and sickness than we have now. At least until we have a critical mass of the population vaccinated and we develop new treatments, there are reasons for people to be afraid.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> We have increased ICU capacity. As the Deputy knows, ICU is not just about a bed but is a whole system of care. We have the beds and we have the kits but training up the staff has to be done over a period of years. We have increased ICU capacity and are using that surge capacity at the moment. It is encouraging that the number of patients in hospital is now falling. It peaked at around 2,000 and is at around 1,700 now and we will see that reflected in the ICU numbers in the coming days. </p>

          <p eId="para_291">I wish to raise the issue of vitamin D supplementation as part of a suite of measures to help to protect our citizens against Covid-19. We all know that the vaccination roll-out will be somewhat delayed and we still do not know if the vaccine will prevent transmission of the virus. We also know that many new variants are emerging and will continue to emerge over the next period. Therefore, it is pretty clear that the fight against Covid-19 nationally and globally will be much longer than we had hoped. I am being as positive as I can be in saying that.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> All ways and means that we have as individuals to protect ourselves, those we care for, our neighbours and friends should be deployed. I have listened to many medics, including Professor Luke O'Neill. This morning he recognised and supported the role of vitamin D in boosting the immune system and thus helping to protect people from different viruses, including Covid-19. I believe that the UK is about to mandate vitamin D supplementation to help protect its citizens. I acknowledge that there have been no double-blind placebo chemical trials but more and more medics, as opposed to alternative healthcare practitioners, are saying that vitamin D has a positive impact. </p>
          <p eId="para_293">The Tánaiste and all other Members want to ensure that our citizens have the very best protection. We agree with the overall approach involving handwashing, the wearing of masks and social distancing, but vitamin D supplementation has a role to play. In my view, and in that of many medics in this country and across the globe, this role is significant. One way or the other, vitamin D plays an important role in supporting our immune systems in fighting Covid-19. That is also what vaccines do. Vaccines do not kill Covid-19, they help our immune systems to fight it. Vitamin D can do likewise. Will the Tánaiste look at the advice in respect of vitamin D supplementation?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_168" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_294">I thank Deputy Harkin for raising this issue because I know it has been a topic of discussion among the general public and among healthcare professionals over recent weeks. The issue was previously raised by Deputy McNamara so I looked into it. As everyone in the House knows, many Irish people are deficient in vitamin D, not least because we do not have much exposure to the sun, a situation that is now worse than ever because people are unable to travel to sunshine destinations. There is evidence that vitamin D may be of benefit in the context of Covid-19 outcomes and there is very little evidence that the taking of vitamin D supplements causes harm. There is research on this matter from Spain, from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, from Trinity and from TU Dublin and articles have been published in the Irish Medical Journal. The respected medical journal, <i>The Lancet</i>, says that it is uncontroversial to promote it and that it may be beneficial with regard to Covid-19 outcomes. Government has asked NPHET to examine the issue and to provide us with formal advice which we can stand over and give to the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> The HSE says that people do not need vitamin D in their diet every day because it does not need to be immediately stored for future use. However, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the HSE recommend that all babies receive a vitamin D supplement during their first year of life. Vitamin D3 is the preferred form of the supplement for infants. Most people should be able to get enough vitamin D by eating a varied and balanced diet and getting some sun, if possible, although that is very hard at the moment, as people will know. If one takes vitamin D supplements, one should be careful not to take too much. Taking 25 mcg or less per day is unlikely to cause any harm and may be of some benefit.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">I am pleased to hear that, like many people, the Tánaiste is open to the real possibility - in my view it is a certainty - that vitamin D supplementation may help. The European Food Safety Authority has concluded that a cause-and-effect relationship has been established between dietary intake of vitamin D and normal functioning of the immune system. The Tánaiste has mentioned this. We know that we do not have enough sunshine in this part of the world to ensure a sufficient dietary intake. Vitamin D protects the immune system, which is the single most important weapon we have to protect us against Covid-19. It is more important than masks, social distancing and so on. Our immune system protects our bodies. I ask the Tánaiste to give the strongest possible consideration to looking at the possibility that supplementation with vitamin D, along with all of the other measures, could help to protect our citizens.</p>

As I am sure she will appreciate, notwithstanding my background as a doctor, I am here as Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and do not wish to dispense medical advice as to which supplements people should or should not take. As the Deputy stated, there is evidence that vitamin D can be beneficial in the context of Covid-19 and there is very little evidence that taking supplements of 25 mcg per day does any harm. We have asked NPHET to examine the matter and to give us further advice, which we can then share with the public, as to whether we should issue a general public advisory in this regard. It is to be hoped that we will have that advice soon.</p>

          <p eId="para_299">The failure to introduce a mandatory post-arrival hotel quarantine for international travellers arriving in the State has been well-flagged. It is a glaring omission in the Government's plan to contain the importation of cases of Covid-19 and is a decision which must be reversed. There is, however, another glaring omission, namely, the failure of the Government to act on the advice of NPHET and the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, with regard to ending discretion in the taking of a post-arrival PCR test by all international arrivals. NPHET has said that its modelling shows that even the best performance in respect of pre-departure Covid-19 tests will miss up to 40% of cases. I know the Tánaiste avoids answering my question but perhaps he will try to answer this one; why has the Government chosen to ignore the advice of NPHET and the CMO as to the issue of post-arrival PCR testing? Will it introduce a mandatory requirement for all international arrivals to take a PCR test post arrival, as recommended by NPHET?</p>

          <p eId="para_300">As the Deputy will know, we now require that anybody entering the State to have a negative PCR test. If people do not have such a test, they are subject to mandatory hotel quarantine. We are examining a change which would result in a requirement for two tests, five days apart. This is recommended by NPHET and we are giving it full consideration. We will make a decision in that regard quite soon. This is the model used in Iceland where two tests are required, five days apart, with quarantine in between. That may well be where we go.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> I will ask the Deputy to do something for us. Sinn Féin is in government on this island and there are two things it can do to help. Sinn Féin co-chairs the Government in Northern Ireland. It is not now the case that people arriving in Belfast have to have a negative PCR test, let alone two. I ask the Deputy to use his influence as a member of the leadership of Sinn Féin to have mandatory PCR testing introduced for people arriving into Belfast in addition to quarantine for those who do not have such a test. I also ask the Deputy to use his influence to put a stop-----</p>

          <p eId="para_308"> The People's Vaccine Alliance, which is made up of organisations including Oxfam and Amnesty International, estimates that wealthier nations, including Ireland, have collectively bought enough doses to vaccinate their entire populations almost three times over. To put that in context, the alliance is of the view that these nations represent 14% of the world's population but own 53% of the supplies of the world's most promising vaccines. What influence are we using internationally, through diplomatic channels and the EU, to ensure some form of equality in the vaccine roll-out for poorer regions which may not have access? There are two reasons we should do so. The first is that it is the right thing to do and the second is that it will help us all.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">The Government is actively involved in this question and is showing leadership on it through involvement with the WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. We are providing money and, down the line, we may even provide spare vaccines to developing countries to help them with their vaccine programmes. We know how infectious diseases work. Covid will always be present somewhere in the world. It is endemic at this stage. Nobody will be safe until everyone is safe. That means that vaccine programmes like those that were used to fight polio, smallpox and other infectious diseases are needed across the world. That is the role we are taking through the UN, the WHO and the EU.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">I wish to raise the need for the re-establishment of the NPHET vulnerable people's subgroup. The work of this subgroup under NPHET was invaluable in the planning for the most vulnerable groups and individuals in society and enabled representation and clear communication with Government from those working on the ground, particularly in disability and voluntary groups. As the Tánaiste will be aware, the group was dissolved after it was deemed that it had met its terms of reference on 28 August and its last meeting was held on 24 June last year. During that meeting, those within the disability and voluntary sectors were concerned about the dissolution and highlighted the need to retain a channel for communications and engagement with Government should a second wave emerge. This has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> I argue that for as long as the virus is with us we need to have this group active and reinstated and perhaps give it a further function afterwards to assist in dealing with the trauma caused by the virus to vulnerable people and individuals. Why does the Government not reinstate this group?</p>

          <p eId="para_314">Yesterday, the Tánaiste told leaving certificate students that clarity on the exams will be provided within the next few weeks. This comment went down like a lead balloon among students who are already feeling a real strain on their mental health. This strain on 17 and 18-year-olds is being caused by both the continuing uncertainty and the continuing threat of a forced leaving certificate examination. The Tánaiste’s comments indicate to me that the Government is both out of touch and out of the loop when it comes to really understanding what is going on here. The Irish Second-Level Students' Union, ISSU, poll published last week showed just 4% support for a stand-alone leaving certificate. Does the Tánaiste accept that stand-alone exams cannot now go ahead given such a crushing level of opposition from the students themselves?</p>

These are the same students who lost a chunk of fifth year and are now also losing several weeks, perhaps even longer, of sixth year. It is very difficult for them. I know that they want an answer from Government as soon as possible on what is going to happen with the leaving certificate examinations and we want to do that but it requires some planning, co-ordination and consultation and the ISSU, as mentioned by the Deputy, is part of that discussion now. A group has been set up involving the Department of Education, the State Examinations Commission, two representatives from the ISSU, together with the teachers' unions, principals and management. It will meet again on Friday and we will try to bring this to a conclusion as soon as possible because we understand the pressure and stress that people are under. In developing a plan, however, we need to be able to answer the questions that they will then ask thereafter and that it what we are working on now.</p>

The journalists work from the kitchen table and bring the news to people's homes. People love these newspapers more than ever, particularly in Covid times.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> Last Friday evening, with less than 24 hours' notice, two journalists with 40 years' service were summarily dismissed and were told to go elsewhere. Mr. Malcolm Denmark and Iconic Newspapers are gobbling up these newspapers, including the <i>Tipperary Star</i> and many more regional newspapers. He has also put a bid in now of €6 million for regional newspapers in England. He can do what he likes over there as that is his own business, but we are going to be devoid of these wonderful publications and it is a shameful way to treat excellent journalists and their families who have put their shoulders to the wheel. They laid waste to another ten staff members in those papers at the beginning of the pandemic, which crisis was used for this purpose. They are in receipt of PUP payments together with everything else but they are destroying our regional newspapers. The Clonmel <i>Nationalist</i> is a wonderful publication.</p>

I note that it will now be used in respect of ports. Is there not a role for antigen testing in our hospitals, in our schools, potentially, when they reopen, and in our airports in the absence of quarantine? Antigen testing could perhaps be used for people at least from safer countries to ensure that travel is taking place in a safe manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_324">I thank the Deputy. I broadly agree that there is a greater role for antigen testing in Ireland into the future but we have to be guided by public health advice on this. NPHET, as the Deputy will be aware, has not been particularly confident about the accuracy of antigen testing and it believes that in many instances it does not meet what the manufacturers say. NPHET has updated its guidance in the past number of days so antigen testing is now going to be used more extensively for outbreaks and for symptomatic cases, and it has changed the definition of a case in Ireland in Ireland to take into account the fact that somebody may test positive on an antigen test and not just on a PCR test. That is a significant change, which has happened only in the past couple of days. Using the antigen test to screen people, for example, for travel or to attend events is a whole other issue and the evidence at the moment is that antigen testing is effective in symptomatic cases but not so much for screening, but that may change.</p>

Some outstanding issues remain, however. As it stands, we see that future patients will have costs covered for their medicine under the cannabis access programme, which is great. Existing patients on individual licences, however, will continue to pay large amounts of money upfront for medication for family members. This will amount to many thousands of euro in costs for those families. Has Bedrocon applied to be part of the cannabis access programme scheme? If so, has there been some outstanding issue regarding the inclusion of that company in the scheme? It is terribly unfair that those families already availing of medicinal cannabis will have to pay for this vital medication, while others will have it provided for free.</p>

The Deputy can go back and check over that from the press conferences etc. What we know now is that Covid-19 was present in Ireland well before that, and that someone had sadly died in Cork University Hospital, CUH, many weeks before the Italian rugby match and the associated Italian flights.

          <p eId="para_345"> The aspiration for a united Ireland is a legitimate one, and it is one I share, but the settled position for Ireland is the Good Friday Agreement and that states that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland can or will cause a referendum to take place when it appears that a majority of people in Northern Ireland would vote for a united Ireland. It is fair to say that we are not currently at that point. What we need to do in the meantime is to make the Good Friday Agreement work, to try to get the Northern Ireland Executive working better and to intensify North-South co-operation and east-west co-operation.</p>

          <p eId="para_346">The Government commissioned a report on pay and allowances for student nurses and midwives. Several weeks ago, as the Tánaiste knows, placements for student nurses and midwives in hospitals were paused for two weeks. That comes to an end this weekend and I have had many calls from student nurses and midwives worried that they have not had any calls from the hospitals where they were placed and they do not know whether they are going back to those placements on Monday. Why is that? Has this cancellation of placements continued beyond two weeks?</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> The Tánaiste is also aware that this House passed a motion on the issue of pay and allowances for student nurses and midwives, including for this report to be published. It has not been published. The motion also called for the March agreement to be reinstated. It has not been reinstated. In addition, the motion called for the second report, which the Minister has stated will look at permanent solutions to be put in place and expedited. That has not taken place. When are we going to see action on this issue and can the Tánaiste offer clarity on the placement issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_348">I appreciate that student nurses are going to want to know what the plan is quite soon. We will get that information out as soon as possible. The placement of student nurses was suspended because, as the Deputy knows, student nurses have to be supervised and tutored. Suspending those placements freed up hundreds of fully-qualified nurses to look after patients and that was the priority. A decision will be made shortly as to whether those placements can be reinstated.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Obviously, the hospitals will need to be less busy for us to be in a position to restore students. The Deputy will be aware that the issue of allowances, pay and so on, is ongoing. There will be engagement with the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and SIPTU about that.</p>

          <p eId="para_350">On many occasions I have brought up the matter of St. Joseph's Foundation, Charleville, which has been looking after children with disabilities since 1968. Deputy O'Donnell's father was a co-founder of St. Joseph's. It provides a service in north Cork and the south Limerick area. With a stroke of a pen it has been decided that the preschool children who have a disability will now be graded geographically. Limerick children have been sent to a facility in Limerick that has a waiting list of 180 for each service. It is not unreasonable to ask that we would have a phase-out system. There are five children within a neighbouring parish to Charleville who are now directly affected and are completely at a disadvantage. If this is to happen, could it at least be on a phased basis in order that the children in the services currently who are on the list could be facilitated in the St. Joseph's Foundation care service?</p>

The Minister for Health called on his Department to devise legislative options to give effect to the programme for Government commitment to extend eligibility for medical cards for patients who are terminally ill.

          <p eId="para_353">I thank the Deputy. I believe the review was published just before Christmas. Much to the disappointment of many people it did not recommend a change.

          <p eId="para_354">I have become aware of a situation with a constituent who, as the victim of domestic violence, had to leave her local authority home for her safety. When this person applied to Tipperary County Council for alternative accommodation she had to reapply to be included on the housing list. Given there is a total of 15 single-bedroom houses available for 690 approved applicants, this woman will be waiting for years. The council gave her a HAP package, but with the shortage of available housing there is little available to her. Is it not disgraceful that a woman who had to flee her home because of domestic abuse is now in a situation where she is officially classed as having given up her council home and must reapply to the waiting list, while her partner and perpetrator of the abuse remains in the house? I put it to the Tánaiste that we need to see measures taken to ensure that victims of such abuse are not the ones who lose out as a result of having to leave their home. Will the Tánaiste take measures to ensure that people who are forced to leave their homes due to violence are not classed as having given up their houses?</p>

          <p eId="para_355">I am very sorry to hear about that case and what that lady is experiencing. I recall that under the last Government we did change the law to give victims of domestic violence much stronger legal rights in situations like this so it is the perpetrator and abuser who has to leave the home, not the victim of the abuse or violence. Perhaps there is a legal remedy in this case that she may be able to take up using that law. Without knowing the detail of the individual case it is difficult for me to answer but the law does provide for that.</p>

          <p eId="para_356">My question is on the rapid antigen testing and it follows on from a similar question from Deputy McNamara earlier. This morning we saw the roll-out of two rapid antigen testing centres to cater for the needs of our hauliers. There is also mounting scientific evidence of the efficacy of such a test. I am not proposing that it would be a replacement for the PCR test but it certainly should be considered as a complementary tool. It is particularly useful for identifying the period or phase during which a person is infectious. In that context, it is especially suited for those working in congregated settings, for example. It is quick, cheap and painless and it has its place as a tool in our fight against this virus. Will the Tánaiste outline briefly the plans in place to deploy rapid antigen testing as part of our Covid response?</p>

          <p eId="para_357">There is a greater role for antigen testing in our response to Covid. We do need to be very much guided by the advice of our scientists and our public health doctors in this regard. They have concerns about the accuracy of antigen testing. It has been introduced at Dublin Airport and in Gorey for hauliers going to France. It is a requirement of the French Government, which accepts antigen testing to enter France. We do not accept it to enter Ireland; we only accept the PCR test in that regard. It does seem that antigen testing can be useful in an outbreak and it can be useful in identifying Covid cases where the person is symptomatic. The more symptomatic one is the more infectious one is, so it is useful in that regard also. The current advice is that it is not useful in screening because it would miss a lot of positive cases. It has been used in parallel to PCR testing in Letterkenny and a few other places. I have been told by the chief clinical officer of the HSE that it had missed many cases that were picked up by PCR.</p>

          <p eId="para_360">I welcome the opportunity to address the House today. We are all aware of the sudden and sustained impact that Covid-19 has had on our everyday lives. The priority for the Government throughout this crisis has been twofold: first to protect public health and limit the spread of the virus and second to put in place income supports that mitigate the financial impact on households.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Following the onset of the crisis, my Department mobilised quickly not only to introduce new payments but to build new IT systems and to reorganise and redeploy staff to ensure that it could deliver these payments and support our citizens. Supports such as the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the enhanced Covid-19 illness benefit payment have been absolutely vital over the past ten months.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> Since last March my Department has made more than 14 million payments under the pandemic unemployment payment scheme to more than 820,000 people at a total cost to date of more than €5.5 billion. The size of those figures reflect the scale of the challenge. I am acutely aware of the difficulties being faced by individuals and families across the State. My Department has taken hundreds of thousands of calls on our income support helpline, hearing from people directly about the issues they face.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> In the time available to me, I will outline a range of supports available from my Department to help those affected by the pandemic, beginning with the PUP. The pandemic unemployment payment was introduced on 15 March 2020 and remains an important income support for hundreds of thousands of workers and their families. The PUP is a simple, quick payment that ensures flexible and timely support to those who lose their employment because of the pandemic. This week, my Department issued payments to more than 475,000 people on the PUP at a cost of almost €143 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> Since 24 December, the number of people in receipt of PUP has increased by almost 200,000. This outlines in stark terms the impact that level 5 restrictions have had on the labour market. It is important today to acknowledge the staff of the Department who worked tirelessly over the Christmas and new year period to process payments and ensure that the people who needed our help got it in a quick and timely manner. As I said earlier, the total spend on PUP to date has been more than €5.5 billion, which will rise significantly further in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">It is worth bearing in mind that what was originally intended to be a six-week payment when it was introduced last March will now be in place for over a year and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> The scale of the Government's intervention through the PUP is unprecedented in scale but it was the right thing to do for our citizens. Research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, examined the impact on family incomes of Covid-19-related job losses and found that 400,000 families would have seen their disposable income fall by more than 20% in the absence of policy measures such as the PUP and the wage subsidy scheme. The ESRI also found that the PUP and temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, measures were particularly effective in cushioning families at the lower end of the income distribution from losses. In fact, the ESRI noted that some low-income families were financially better off than while in work. In its analysis of the budget changes, the ESRI also concluded that income inequality and poverty rates would have increased significantly in the absence of Covid-related policy supports such as the PUP and the wage subsidy scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Throughout the pandemic, we have supported people who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or who were required to self-isolate through the enhanced Covid-19 illness benefit of €350. Since last March, almost 121,000 people have been medically certified for receipt of the Covid-19 enhanced illness benefit and there are currently over 9,700 people in payment. The enhanced illness benefit encourages people not to go to work when they should be isolating. This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause further pressures on the health system. The support is payable for two weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to ten weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> In addition to these core income supports, a range of other targeted measures have been put in place as part of budget 2021 to address issues that have arisen during the pandemic. Increases to the qualified child payments are benefiting 419,000 children who are most in need. The value of the living alone allowance increased by €5. This means that the value of the allowance has more than doubled over a two-year period. My Department has put in place flexibility to support lone parents where maintenance payments have been disrupted during the pandemic. In response to concerns about increased domestic violence, my Department has introduced flexibility to the rent supplement scheme in order that victims of domestic violence can get the payment for three months without a means test. The school meals programme has remained in operation throughout the pandemic, including during the summer and Christmas breaks. Funding continues to be provided by my Department to run the programme during school closures.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> The fuel season was extended in 2020 by four weeks, at an additional cost of almost €37 million. Since 4 January, the weekly fuel allowance payment has also been increased by €3.50 per week to €28 for a period of 28 weeks. We have put arrangements in place so that births and deaths can now be registered online without the need for people to attend offices in person. As announced in budget 2021, parent's leave and benefit will be extended from two weeks for each parent to five weeks. This addresses concerns raised about the impact of the pandemic on parents of new babies. The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, is working on the necessary legislation in order that parents can avail of this additional leave as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> Covid-19 has had a significant impact on social protection expenditure. The 2020 Revised Estimates published in December 2019, prior to the onset of Covid-19, projected expenditure for the Department to be in the region of €21.2 billion. By November 2020, when I appeared before the select committee with further Revised Estimates, expenditure up to the end of 2020 was expected to be €31.57 billion, nearly €10.4 billion higher than pre-Covid estimates. The vast majority of this additional spending is directly related to the measures the Government has taken to support workers and their employers. Deputies will also recall that the Christmas bonus was paid to PUP recipients and those receiving similar payments, provided they had been on the payment for at least four months. This is in addition to payment of the bonus to recipients of long-term social welfare payments. The Christmas bonus in 2020 cost a total of €389 million, its highest level ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> While there is light at the end of the pandemic tunnel with the roll-out of vaccines, the impact of Covid-19 on people's incomes and economic activity continues to be uncertain. Earlier this month, I secured Government approval for the PUP to remain in place at the current rates of payment until 31 March this year. Obviously, given the extension of current restrictions until 5 March, we will now need to examine the future of the PUP beyond the end of March. That is a discussion I will be having with my Government colleagues over the next few weeks, taking account of where we are in terms of the trajectory of the virus and the roll-out of the vaccine programme. I assure the House that the Department of Social Protection will continue to support people for so long as restrictions apply as we have done at all times over the past year. Equally important, my Department is committed to assisting and supporting people to return to employment as we move beyond Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> As a former Minister with responsibility for business and enterprise, I am keenly aware of the impact of the pandemic on the livelihoods of the self-employed. Throughout the course of the past ten months, I have engaged regularly with businesses and groups representing the self-employed. I was pleased, with the support of my Oireachtas colleagues, to make changes in order that self-employed people can now earn up to €960 over an eight-week period, while retaining their full PUP entitlement. This is something that has been particularly welcomed by workers in our arts and entertainment sector and, indeed, our taxi drivers. I was also pleased to secure the extension into 2021 of the Covid-19 enterprise support grant. This was introduced in August 2020 to assist microbusinesses and provides up to €1,000 to cover restart costs where a person transitions from the PUP back into self-employment. This once-off grant is available to small businesses and is payable to those employing fewer than ten people with an annual turnover of less than €1 million. To date, almost 8,600 businesses have been supported under this grant at a cost of just under €8 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> The July jobs stimulus package, designed in response to the Covid-19 crisis, comprises an investment of €200 million in skills development, work placement, training and education, recruitment subsidies and job search and assistance measures. My Department will be ramping up its employment supports across the board. Measures will include the expansion of the local employment service, LES, into new areas that currently do not have a LES service. We have also secured funding for an additional 3,000 places on community employment, CE, and Tús schemes. An additional 100 job coaches will be assigned to Intreo offices across the country to help people get back to work. We have waived the waiting period for persons on the PUP who want to avail of the back to education allowance and back to work allowance schemes. Of course, we will also be working closely with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in signposting people towards the 35,000 extra higher education places, apprenticeship schemes and other supports that are available. These and other supports will be a key focus of the new pathways to work strategy, which is currently being developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> Before I conclude, I pay tribute to the dedication and hard work of the staff in my Department. Throughout a very difficult year they have shown great flexibility and commitment to meet the extraordinary demands placed upon them. They have processed the equivalent of eight years' worth of claims through the PUP scheme alone, and they have managed to do all that while still keeping on top of the day-to-day work of processing pensions, disability, carer's and other payments. The Department staff provide a great service in every county and I know Members will join me today in acknowledging their efforts and Trojan work over the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> I will now hand over to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and I look forward to hearing Deputies' contributions.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">There has been some public discussion about the impact of Covid-19 on the most marginalised and socially excluded in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">This has relevance to my remit in overseeing the Government's roadmap for social inclusion. However, this is a global pandemic so one has to acknowledge the global inequalities that the pandemic has brought to light.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> In some respects the virus does not discriminate. The rate of virus fatalities is actually highest in some of the richest countries in the world, such as Italy, the USA, Belgium and our near neighbour, the UK. It is when we look at global vaccine access that the issue of inequality comes more to the fore. Let there be no mistake about it; Ireland is certainly on the list of "haves" rather than "have nots" when it comes to global vaccine access. The odds are that when the vaccine has been rolled out in Ireland, there will still be people in developing countries who will not have access to it. I commend and support Ireland’s involvement in and support of the COVAX initiative to offset this likely pattern, as well as our other contributions to global efforts. </p>
          <p eId="para_379"> As regards Ireland’s vaccine strategy, it is important to acknowledge that it is based on the principle of equity and is clinically driven. This is not the case in every country. In Ireland, access to the vaccine does not depend on one's income, background or where one is from. When looking at the impact of Covid on the most socially excluded in Ireland, there are three realms or areas to look at, namely, vaccine access, infection rates and fatalities and the secondary impact of the public health measures. For vaccine access, the principle of equity is central, along with being clinically driven.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> Infection rates are more complex and need further examination. Health workers, among whom there is a high number of ethnic minorities, suffer by far the highest infection rates of any profession. I thank them profoundly for their service and their ongoing daily struggle. In terms of fatalities our oldest citizens are hardest hit, almost regardless of background, but so are those with underlying health conditions. It is in this group that the issue of inequality emerges. While some health conditions are due to the genetic luck of the draw, many stem from health inequality. As regards the national roadmap for social inclusion and Department of Health commitments within it, there are some key commitments relating to Sláintecare, GP access and a health inclusion policy that need to be implemented. On the topic of health inequality, I acknowledge the speech of Senator Eileen Flynn in the Seanad earlier this week when she spoke about the extreme health inequalities faced by Travellers. </p>
          <p eId="para_381"> The third area to look at when assessing the impact of Covid-19 on the most marginalised is the secondary impact of public health measures. It is in this realm that there is work to do and where more needs will emerge over time. These include access to education for poorer students, students with additional needs and migrant students with English language support needs, as well as people who need disability services and other groups. There have also been some positive outcomes in the area of inclusion from the secondary impacts of public health restrictions. Conditions in Irish prisons have improved and homelessness has gone down by 25%, although this progress is precarious. It is also important to reiterate how the Government has acted to help prevent poverty and social exclusion with the huge intervention of the pandemic unemployment payment. </p>
          <p eId="para_382"> I chair the interdepartmental social inclusion roadmap steering group, which monitors implementation of its commitments across Departments. While this roadmap was developed and adopted in advance of the imposition of public health restrictions arising from the pandemic, these commitments remain even more valid as we deal with the challenge of the impact of Covid on our society. Ahead of the second meeting of the steering group in March, I will be asking all Departments to consider this added dimension of pandemic impacts when reporting on progress in implementing the roadmap.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> The annual Social Inclusion Forum is also scheduled for March and my Department is arranging to hold it remotely this year. The community and voluntary sectors were consulted when selecting the topics for discussion at this year’s forum. It is notable that there was an eagerness to keep focus on pre-Covid issues of exclusion, which are of course ongoing. The forum and the processes leading up to it, including regional workshops to prepare for it, give people who are directly affected by poverty and social exclusion and those who work for them a voice in the development of the policies that directly affect them, as well as in the ways policies are implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> Community employment is a key area of my brief, although I will have to cut my remarks on it short because time is pushing on. I acknowledge the work done by community employment schemes across the country. We are all aware of the value of these projects, both to individual participants and to the community. Some of these projects continued to provide essential services, where possible, in compliance with public health restrictions over the past months. However, in common with most other organisations and businesses, some have had to restrict or suspend activities. Nevertheless, the Department has continued to fund these schemes and will keep doing so by extending the assignment period for participants as necessary. Given the impact of the pandemic and the necessary public health restrictions, some community employment sponsors have also faced challenges in maintaining the normal level of participation on community employment projects during the pandemic. This has resulted in vacancies on a number of schemes which, although not an issue for most schemes given the relatively low level of activity generally, is posing challenges for some.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> Accordingly, in order to support community employment and Tús projects to restore and maintain continuity of service provision to local communities, all community employment participants whose contracts would have come to an end since the imposition of level 5 restrictions last October have been given an extension, at least until the end of March 2021. There are 5,000 such contract extensions and if necessary, these extensions will continue past 31 March. There will be no sudden cliff edge or date on which all contracts will come to an end. Whenever we get to the stage of returning to normal, the phasing out of community employment contracts can be done on a staggered basis at a local level to ensure key services can continue. In doing this I am mindful that a key purpose of community employment and Tús schemes is to support long-term unemployed people by providing them with an opportunity to gain work experience and develop skills while delivering services to their local communities. Accordingly, in order to ensure a fair distribution of community employment and Tús opportunities, we will be prioritising a return to normal jobseeker referral processes once restrictions are lifted. We will also be introducing 3,000 additional places, as provided for under the July jobs stimulus and are actively engaging with sponsors towards this end. When providing community employment training places, we need to prioritise those who can be furthest from the labour market, such as members of the Traveller and Roma communities, those in receipt of a disability-related payment and people recovering from addiction. We need to focus in particular on those jobseekers who have been on the live register since before the original Covid emergency in March last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> I acknowledge the staff of the Department across the country who are also front-line workers and who have been taking risks for the good of others and for our battle against Covid. I acknowledge and appreciate them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Claire Kerrane<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_387">I will allow time for the Minister and Minister of State to respond. I join with them in paying tribute to the Department of Social Protection staff, who have clearly been working under extreme pressure since Covid first hit and are due great credit for the work they have done. I always find them to be extremely helpful and I thank them for all their service in this last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> My first questions relate to the PUP. I acknowledge what the Minister has said about a possible extension. As we all know, the PUP is due to end at the end of March and the plan was for people to be moved onto jobseekers' payments at that point. The Minister has said that this matter will be looked at in the next few weeks. I ask that that be done as a matter of urgency and that an announcement be made on it sooner rather than later, in order to ensure people have certainty regarding the next few months. I would like the Minister to extend the PUP. There are different requirements for jobseekers' payments and people get higher rates under the PUP. I ask the Minister to keep the PUP open to those who will need it in the months ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> Will the Minister advertise and publicise the fact that parents who cannot return to work due to childcare facilities or schools being closed can now access the PUP? That is a welcome move but I ask the Minister to publicise it because parents are simply not aware of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> I note what the Minister said about reports that showed people on the PUP are better off. There is a range of people on the PUP and people who earned over €400 a week previously are on €350 a week. Many people on the PUP are actually on less now so I assume when the Minister said that, she was looking at those who are getting €203 a week, who had previously earned €200 or less. We have to remember that nobody in this State is better off on €203 a week. That is usually the maximum payment for social protection and it is set below the poverty line. Nobody in this State is better off on €203, particularly when one looks at the cost of living, which has increased year-on-year in the last few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> As regards community employment, the issue is not the number of places. Today, there are over 1,700 vacancies on community employment schemes. The issue, which has been raised very well down in Kerry, is the three-year rule. </p>
          <p eId="para_392">People providing essential community services such as meals-on-wheels have to leave the scheme when the three years expires and in some cases that service cannot be continued. I am again asking the Minister to review the three-year rule because it is hampering important and essential services in our community, particularly services for the elderly. Places are not the issue in a great many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> I regret that nothing has been announced in regard to the fuel allowance and fuel costs. We know people are spending more time at home and that energy costs have increased in the last year. We know also that a report from the Minister's Department shows that carbon tax increases, including those introduced in the last budget, will impact disproportionately on low income households. There was a slight increase in the fuel allowance, which I welcome, but we need a specific measure for those affected by Covid. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is clear that we will face a major issue with utility debt. I am sure the Minister is aware of the ten asks of the National One Parent Family Alliance, NOPFA, one of which relates to a discretionary fund. I note a number of other countries have introduced such a fund. NOPFA is seeking an initial discretionary fund of €5 million to help those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment and, perhaps, those in receipt of the working family payment and other social welfare payments, to meet their bills. It is a major issue at this time of year in particular. I ask the Minister to confirm if she has seen the asks from the National Lone Parent Family Alliance and if she will consider the establishment of a discretionary fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> In regard to the fuel allowance, I again ask the Minister to look at suspending the 15-month rule, even on a temporary basis. A person who loses his or her job in October is not entitled to any assistance with fuel costs for that winter or the following winter. The allowance will not be payable until the following February 12 months, which is too long. This is leaving people who are losing their jobs with no assistance in regard to fuel costs. I again ask the Minister to consider suspending the 15-month rule, even on a temporary basis for the duration of Covid.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> On parental leave and benefit, the Minister said that the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, is preparing the relevant legislation and it will be introduced as soon as possible. I would like to know the reason for the delay in regard to this legislation given it will only change the reference from two weeks to five weeks. It is probably only a change in the figure from 2 to 5. Parents are desperately in need of this leave. They are currently taking unpaid leave that they cannot afford. This is leaving parents and families in precarious situations. I ask the Minister to raise with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, the need for this leave to be introduced as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> I want to raise another issue that is, perhaps, a minor issue in comparison with everything that has been said, including in the Minister's contribution. The issue is the continued use of the electronic pen in post offices, particularly for older people. A number of my older constituents have been in touch with me on this issue. The practice was suspended when we were in a far less grave situation in terms of Covid than we are today. Currently, elderly people are required by post offices to use the electronic pen to sign to collect their pension. They feel very uneasy about this. I appreciate sanitisers are available and that social distancing guidelines are in place but they are nervous. I do not understand why when this practice was suspended when the incidence of Covid was not half as bad as it is now, it is in place again now.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> I again urge the Minister to look at the rules in regard to the fuel allowance. Many people, children and lone parent families were in poverty long before Covid came along. The situation now is one hundred times worse for those families, particularly those families in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, including those in the entertainment sector who have not worked for almost one year at this stage. They need help with their bills. The largest of these bills is their utility bills but there is no assistance available to them in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">I thank Deputy Kerrane for raising these issues. I will try to respond to as many as I can within the time available to me. In regard to the future of the PUP, the Deputy will be aware that earlier this month I secured Government approval for the retention of the current rates of payment until 31 March next. With the extension of the current restrictions until 5 March, it is clear to everybody that we now need to look beyond the end of March in this regard. I will consult with my Government colleagues over the coming weeks on where we are in respect of the trajectory of the virus, the roll-out of the vaccine and where we are at in reopening the economy. I want to assure the Deputy that the Government will not be found wanting and has not been found wanting in supporting people who have found themselves in this very difficult situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> With regard to the community employment, CE, schemes, I will defer that question to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien. On the fuel allowance, it is payable up to 9 April. We continue to keep the situation under review and will look at it again at the end of March in the context of the circumstances prevailing at that time. The Deputy will be aware that the fuel allowance was increased as recently as the beginning of January 2021. An increase of under €1 was recommended by the Vincentians. We did better than that and increased it by €3.50. The current rate is now €28 per week. As I said, I keep these matters under review. Any person or family that is having genuine difficulty heating their home can apply to a community welfare officer for the exceptional needs payment in respect of heating costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> With regard to the 15-month rule mentioned by the Deputy, this has been the norm for some time now but I will discuss it with my officials. The Deputy's proposal would have a budgetary consequence. With regard to parental leave, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is preparing that legislation, which I expect is a little more complex than just changing a figure in the existing legislation. Government and the Minister want to get it through as quickly as possible. We are readying our IT systems such that payments can be made as soon as possible after enactment of the legislation. I will defer to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, to respond to the question on the CE scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_404">I note the Deputy's point in regard to the three-year rule. The Minister and I met 25 CE sponsors during the week and it is an issue that was raised. In essence, the three-year rule is currently suspended because we are extending contracts. Currently, and up until end of March at least, the rule should not be causing a problem. It is important to say that initially the CE schemes are for one year.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> On the fuel allowance, the increase in the carbon tax has not come into effect and will not come into effect until May but the increase in the fuel allowance came into effect in January. We have asked the ESRI to ensure that the increase in the carbon tax would be offset by the social welfare increases.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">I have a number of short questions. I would appreciate it if I could engage in a question and answer session with the Minister and Minister of State. The Minister will be aware that the decision to tax the pandemic unemployment payment came as a shock to people who were already feeling very vulnerable. On several occasions, I have heard people refer to it as a "kick in the teeth". The Minister will be aware that the PUP was introduced as an urgent needs payment. Under section 126 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 such payments were exempt from taxation for the 20 weeks up to 5 August when they were put on a statutory footing. The job of the Minister for Social Protection in many respects is to protect those people in receipt of these payments. When did the Department of Finance first bring to the attention of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, its intention to tax these payments and did she raise any objection to that proposal? In light of the statement by the Free Legal Aid Centre that the taxation of these payments for that period could be unconstitutional, did the Minister seek any legal advice in that regard?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_233" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
          <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_407">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. All legislation enjoys the assumption of constitutionality. The Minister for Finance determines taxation policy. The legislation has gone through both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance are of the view that it is constitutional. The Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are clear on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The position is that the PUP is taxable. It is important to remember that payments from the Department of Social Protection are, in general, taxable sources of income. For example, jobseeker's benefit payments are taxable. The PUP follows this general taxation rule for social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> The data show that in the case of people who are on PUP only, more of them are due a refund than are due to pay extra tax. In the case of lower-income households or those whose income solely comprises social welfare payments, a liability to tax typically does not arise because the value of social welfare payments received in a tax year is usually not liable for tax. Revenue will be adopting a fair and flexible approach to collecting tax due on payments made under the PUP scheme. Revenue has also given assurances that if any income tax and USC liability still arises following the allocation of the unused tax credits, it will work with PUP recipients to collect the outstanding liabilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">I am taking it that she did not raise any objections. The truth of the matter is that these payments were not taxable until the Government changed the law in November of last year. Since then, in the early weeks of this year, people who were not expecting them have been receiving tax bills of up to €1,400. This is a retrospective measure. People who received the PUP as an urgent need payment in the early part of this pandemic had every right to expect that it would not be taxed. I find it ironic that in the week following the revelation that Irish billionaires have increased their wealth by €3.3 billion, the Government has not found a way retrospectively to tax high and mega-wealthy earners within our society. There has been no proposal to tax vulture funds, cuckoo funds or banks, which are, in essence, exempt from paying tax for the next 20 years. The Minister will have to agree that there are double standards at play. I take this opportunity to appeal to her to use her offices to ditch the taxation on the payments that were made under the PUP scheme up to 5 August last year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_237">
          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_413">I will use the short time available to have a quick back-and-forth exchange with the Minister. In respect of the taxation of the PUP, the paper on this issue by the Free Legal Advice Centres and the arguments made in it are very compelling. It is important for us to pursue the point in regard to taxation that is applied retrospectively. Prior to the enactment of the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 last August, claimants could only be expected to have relied on the official information published by the Department of Social Protection in order to ascertain whether the PUP would be subject to tax. However, neither the application form for the PUP nor the relevant web page on <i>gov.ie</i> offered any guidance in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> There appear to be inconsistencies between the official statements released by the Department and the political statements released by the Minister for Finance regarding the original legal basis of the PUP and the implications it had for the potential taxation of the payment. In May 2020, the PUP was described as a social welfare payment that is taxable as income. That was in response to a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance. In August 2020, however, the PUP was categorised as a social assistance payment. Such payments are not normally subject to tax. The original Covid PUP scheme was described as having been paid pursuant to section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act. I foresee that this will, potentially and ultimately, become a matter for the courts. The Minister states that the taxation of the payment is constitutional but the issue of fairness applies in the question of whether anybody who made the application for PUP could reasonably have expected, when he or she applied for it, that it would be taxed. I know the Minister will come back to me on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> The second point I would like to make relates to persons who have contacted our offices in respect of loved ones who have passed away. There are, within the system, many sections of the Department and the Department of Heath that people have to go through to put in order the affairs of persons who have received payments, in terms of notifications and whatnot. I ask that the Minister sit down with her officials with a view to creating a one-stop shop for bereaved persons in order that when their loved ones pass away, there is as seamless a process as possible. If there is a one-stop shop, it would help many grieving families, particularly at this point in time when many people are losing loved ones. I acknowledge the sympathetic and empathetic manner in which social welfare officials deal with people in that situation. In my experience, the engagement has been extremely positive and I want to acknowledge the officials' role.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> My third point is in regard to community employment, CE, schemes. I welcome the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, in respect of the extension of the timeframe. What consideration is being give to CE supervisors' pension request? Where stands that process at the moment? I understood from the Minister's predecessor that there was a legitimate expectation on the part of CE supervisors that there would be a protocol or something put in place that would acknowledge their roles and provide for pension entitlements or some sort of acknowledgment of the work they have done, many of them over decades. I ask the Minister or Minister of State to indicate whether or not there is a realistic expectation on the part of CE supervisors that they will receive a pension or some sort of payment for the exceptional work they have done in our communities. We would all support such a proposal if it were to bear fruit as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_417">I thank the Deputy for raising those issues. To be clear, the PUP is classified in the same way as the jobseeker's payment but it has an extra benefit. It is important to say that. Full social insurance credits are being made to everybody who is on the PUP. We will all accept that this is a very valuable contribution. It is important that those credits continue because they are very important when people are looking for other benefits at a later stage, whether maternity benefits, pension or many of the other benefits that we pay out. The exceptional needs payment is not taxable and was never taxable because it is covering an expense that would occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> I will move on. The Deputy asked about deceased persons. I spoke recently to the head of the General Register Office and we are looking at doing a consultation on registration of deaths in order to make the process easier for people. This is a very difficult issue for people at this minute in time and I fully understand and take on board what the Deputy said in that regard. I know that our staff are very considerate in times of trouble for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> On the issue of the CE pensions, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, has met with a delegation of supervisors and there is ongoing work between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in trying to find a resolution to this issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul McAuliffe<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_420">I am sharing time with Deputy Ó Cathasaigh. I have a number of questions for the Minister but I will begin by responding to the claims by both the Labour Party and Sinn Féin regarding the waiving of the tax liability for people on the PUP and those whose employers received the employment wage subsidy scheme. Both parties are showing blatant hypocrisy because they are not equally calling for the tax liability of workers who worked throughout the pandemic and earned the same amount of money in the same period of time to be amended. They are suggesting that people who worked in supermarkets for that entire period should somehow pay more tax than people who earned the same amount of money. They are saying that healthcare workers who worked throughout the pandemic should pay more tax than people who earned the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">It is complete hypocrisy and populism from two parties that claim to be on the left and wish to raise taxes and have public services. They are not being consistent with their policies and with the people who have worked through this pandemic. If a person earns the same amount as another, the person should pay the same tax. I do not agree with the hypocrisy from the two previous speakers.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> I welcome the call that the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister of State had this week with representatives of CE schemes. I got significant positive feedback from them and I believe they felt heard, especially those on the front line. I am taking my lead, in particular, from the Finglas Meals on Wheels service. Those involved believe that for the first time the Minister was hearing their concerns directly. This applies especially to the issue of referrals. We have 13 vacancies in the Finglas service. The service has provided meals every day throughout the pandemic when it could, yet it has not received a referral from the Department in more than three years. Clearly, there is a need for vacancies but they are not being sent.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> I have made a broader point to the Minister several times. It is about the need to recognise these types of CE schemes as being more than simply a training opportunity. They are providing a front-line service supporting the health of people and supporting people at home. The Department does not solely fund the training scheme. Will the Minister outline the outcomes of that call and what actions she intends to take?</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> My next question relates to liaising between the Minister for Health and his Department. What additional measures does the Minister believe she can bring to the CE schemes that provide far more than simply a training opportunity?</p>

          <p eId="para_425">I recall the CE supervisor scheme that the Deputy is talking about. Many good suggestions were made during that call and we will take them away and consider them. I wish to be clear about one point. We always consider CE schemes as having a dual purpose. It is not only an employment and training opportunity but the schemes exist to provide a local community service as well - I wish to acknowledge that formally.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> It is probably fair to say that the activation services of our local offices have been very much reduced in recent months. That has had an impact on the number of referrals to CE schemes. It is probably down to 30% at the moment. As the economy opens up, the service will reopen and more referrals will come from local Intreo offices. CE schemes are entitled to look for posts as well, but I acknowledge that it is like working with one arm tied behind one's back given the reduced Intreo capacity in recent months. Anyway, that will ramp up as time goes on and as the economy reopens.</p>

          <p eId="para_427">While I appreciate that the Minister of State recognises the dual role and the fact that many CE schemes provide a community service, I believe some CE schemes are providing State services. A Meals on Wheels service is not equivalent to a CE scheme in a football club, GAA club or community hall. It is, and should be, a direct front-line service provided by the State. In many ways we are exploiting people who are on a training opportunity. I am a former Tús supervisor so I do not use the word "exploit" easily because the opportunity is extraordinarily valuable for everyone on a Tús or CE scheme. However, we should ensure we provide additional supports from the Department of Health so that the role is recognised and supported financially.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I have become aware of an information technology glitch that is delaying PUP arrears payments. I have been contacted by several people. Will the Minister shed some light on that? When will all the PUP arrears be paid? How many are on that list? She can come back to me afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> In recent days we have all come to realise that this lockdown will last longer, yet, for some, it looks longer again. I am talking about those who work in aviation and airports. It is not only pilots who have made representations to the House but everyone in the airport community right down to people who work in shops and so on. Will the Department consider a specific intervention for them? It seems 5 March does not look like any kind of deadline for them and there is such uncertainty. We know that we are in a transition and need to reduce carbon. Airline travel will be reduced over time, hopefully. We need to have a just transition for all airport workers to ensure they are supported.</p>

          <p eId="para_430">Since the introduction of the PUP in March approximately 850,000 individuals have applied for the payment. In some cases, they have done so on several occasions as they have moved in and out of employment or where the employer availed of the Revenue temporary wage subsidy scheme. Consequently, there were more than 1.5 million applications to be examined to determine if arrears were due. This is mainly due to the initial time lag in the commencement of payments. These arrears have now been paid. They were paid mainly on 1 December, when 286,000 people received arrears totalling €134 million. A smaller group of people received an arrears payment in the past two weeks due to the extension of the reference period for earnings to September 2020.

          <from>Deputy Marc Ó Cathasaigh<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_431">I will attempt to be brief to allow some time for the Ministers to come back on my questions. There is no doubt that the pandemic has had an extraordinary and adverse impact on our labour market as well as broader society. Our response in social protection measures has had to be equally extraordinary. As the Minister detailed earlier, the cost to the Exchequer for the PUP is in excess of €5.5 billion and climbing all the while. This is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> In a broad sense, it has been effective. The ERSI has found that the PUP and the various iterations of employment income supports have been effective in cushioning families at the lower end, that is to say, those at the bottom 40% of the income distribution, from income losses during the pandemic. I am acutely aware that this broad-stroke analysis glosses over many individual stories of financial hardship that all of us are dealing with in our inboxes and constituency clinics, whether they are conducted online or wherever.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> We know that this pandemic has not affected all of society equally. We know it disproportionately affects lower paid jobs, whether in retail, hospitality or the service industry jobs that have disappeared from the economy. We know that in terms of employment, younger people have had to bear the brunt in the effects on seasonal or part-time employment and on their education, college experience and social lives. The impact of this should not be discounted.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> I believe the Covid-19 responses have demonstrated an extraordinary act of intergenerational solidarity. A generation far less likely to feel the worst physical effects of the virus is making extraordinary sacrifices to protect our older and more vulnerable communities. I hope that on the far side of this pandemic, whenever we get there, we remember that act of solidarity when we come to addressing the types of issues that weigh most heavily on our young people. The climate crisis and the housing crisis come to mind in particular in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> I wish to turn to the question of lone parents and the impact the lockdown is having on this cohort. Lone parents are one of the cohorts in our society often farthest removed from the labour force. Among the key findings of the 2017 report from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection on lone parents was the fact that one-parent families endure the highest consistent poverty of any group in society. The figure is a little over 26%. Lone parents suffer the highest rates of deprivation, the rate being a shocking 57.9%. Children in one-parent families are three times as likely to live in consistent poverty than families with two adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> Measures were introduced in the budget for 2021 aimed at this cohort. The increase for a qualified child, IQC, rate is chief among these. We can reasonably anticipate that the pandemic will have exacerbated this situation, for example, with the lack of childcare, the closure of schools and the evaporation of part-time working opportunities. All these serve to create a perfect storm for lone-parent families.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> Are we undertaking the monitoring and reporting of lone parents in respect of education and poverty levels as recommended in the 2017 report? Is there data on the impact of our Covid-19 response on this cohort? Is this being monitored in real time? Is a plan being developed for the far side of this pandemic? How can the impacts be addressed once we come out of the Covid-19 crisis, in the income impacts on this cohort and in providing access to opportunities in employment and education to better the lot of lone-parent families?</p>

          <p eId="para_438">The Deputy has outlined all the supports we have been giving to lone parents. Significant support has been provided during the pandemic to customers on the one-parent family payment who lost their employment. They have been allowed to keep their primary payment and to claim the PUP concurrently. It is important to say that. That is of help to lone parents. Their representatives have highlighted the importance of the school meals, which have continued during the pandemic, including during the summer and the school holidays. They also continue during the winter holidays, over Christmas. We have funded schools to enable them to give the school meals to children. My Department has also put in place very flexible arrangements to restore payment rates for lone parents where maintenance payments have stopped. We have increased the qualified child allowance in the budget to €38 for children under 12 and to €45 for children over 12, and the one-parent family payment earnings threshold of €425 will be removed from April 2021. In answer to the Deputy's questions, we continually review the situation and we certainly take on board the findings and the reports we do on this issue. The ESRI has compiled a study and we are certainly looking at all the issues raised in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">I wish to take two minutes and then give the Minister two minutes to respond, after which I will come back in for the final minute.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> In these tough times, when Covid is affecting every person and every area of the country and when all areas are dependent on a little help from the Department and the Government, may I tell the Minister about my constituency of Meath West? The Department recently announced funding. I will give her a few examples of how it distributed that funding. The educational disadvantage funding for Louth and Meath, with a population of 340,000, amounted to €386,000; the adjacent constituency, with a population of 137,000, received €520,000. Under outdoor recreational infrastructure funding, Meath West received €29,500; the constituency beside us received €214,000. Under community enhancement funding, Meath West received €44,700; the neighbouring constituency received €112,000. Under CLÁR, Meath West received €80,600 and the neighbouring constituency received €630,000. Worst of all, under town and village funding, out of €15.4 million, all Meath West was entitled to was €100,000. That is 15 times less than the funding the adjacent constituency received. I spoke to the Minister before this funding was announced and told her of a project in my area, where there is a great deal of antisocial behaviour. It submitted an application for funding. Needless to say, the Minister did not fund it.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> I have three questions for the Minister. Is it acceptable or fair that a constituency of a similar size to Meath West receives 15 times more funding? What criteria does her Department use when assessing applications for funding? Does she think that if funding cannot be distributed fairly across the board, there should be another way of doing it, or is it a case of who you know rather than the people who are most deserving?</p>

          <p eId="para_442">First, I assure the Deputy that all the applications received by my Department are assessed independently. Second, if people do not send in applications, they cannot be funded. It depends on the number. Some counties are much better at submitting applications than others. If we do not get an application for a project, we cannot fund it. Third, if the application is not up to standard and does not meet the criteria set out under the scheme, it is not deemed eligible on many occasions. I do not even see those applications because the point is that they are assessed, as I said, independently. The most recent scheme was the outdoor recreation scheme. As far as I know, the applications for it first of all went through Pobal, which assessed them, and then, once they scored over a certain bar, they came to my Department and the funding was allocated, I can assure the Deputy, in a very open, transparent, fair and balanced way. The Deputy should get the community groups or the local authority to engage with my Department, see exactly where the application fell down and resubmit it. I will open up all those funding streams during this year and I am glad to say I have got increased funding for many of the streams the Deputy is talking about.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">What we ask for the people of Meath West is equal treatment, fairness and respect. The Minister's constituency received 15 times more funding than the people of Meath West. That is not fair. This has gone on and on for years. The people of Meath have been let down by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. We are constantly at the bottom of the pile. It does not matter what the funding is; Meath West and Meath in general are at the bottom of the pile. I ask the Minister to be fair with us and to give us what we are entitled to. That is all we ask for. I do not want any favours from the Minister but she should have a bit of respect for the people of Meath West.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">I assure the Deputy that fairness is something we uphold in the Government, and everybody is treated with respect and fairness. I can assure the Deputy that all the applications we received were fairly and independently assessed and were scored on their merits. As I said, some counties do not get as much as others because they do not put in applications. I cannot produce money and give it to them if they do not send in good-quality applications. I therefore ask those unsuccessful applicants to engage with my Department and resubmit improved applications. I have no doubt but that they will be successful. I want to see every community across the country supported in every way we can.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">I will begin by commending the Department on what has been excellent work over almost a year now. When we engage with them on any sort of issue, they are very fast and prompt in their response, so I commend her and her Department on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> Has the Minister seen the ten demands outlined by the National One Parent Family Alliance, which recently wrote to her with those ten demands? I would be interested to know if she has seen those demands. The alliance has put them forward as a manner in which to alleviate the deprivation experienced by our most vulnerable group, namely one-parent families, who are consistently at risk of poverty and deprivation, which has been enhanced throughout the pandemic. I will ask the Minister specific questions about those demands but I would be interested to know first if she has read all ten of them.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The alliance welcomed the confirmation that the PUP is available to parents who cannot work due to childcare issues and school closures. It believes, however, that the Government needs to go further and ensure that one-parent families are not pulled deeper into poverty. It is calling on the Government to implement ten urgent actions, seven of which are relevant to this Department. It is calling for special measures to increase payments to families with children and, in particular, lone parents. There is the fuel allowance assistance. Many of the actions proposed are already in train and in place, for example access for people caring for children to the PUP, communications with employers and potential beneficiaries and flexibility with rent supplement. Other actions required, such as payment increases, are best dealt with in a targeted manner via the supplementary welfare allowance. That payment is available to anybody who gets into difficulty. We have the exceptional needs payment, and I encourage people to use that payment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GaryGannon" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Deputy Gary Gannon<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_450">While the Minister is encouraging people to use the payment, will her Department initiate an advertising campaign letting people know that the payment is available? One of the issues is that when the announcements are made, they often go unannounced in the media and people do not know the payments are available. I see that two of the asks of the National One Parent Family Alliance pertain simply to advertising - for example, "Run a widespread public information campaign and issue a clear communication that parents are entitled to receive the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) if they are unable to work due to lack of childcare." The third action states, "Run a public-facing campaign to make tenants and PUP recipients aware of the entitlement criteria for the more flexible form of Rent Supplement." That is a very reasonable ask. The alliance is commending the fact that these measures exist; all it is asking for is that they be advertised more publicly and that one-parent families are made aware of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> The fourth action states, "Make a double payment of the fuel allowance (€56) for two weeks at the end of January/beginning of February to help low-income households with additional heating costs associated with being home more."</p>
          <p eId="para_452">No. 7 states: "Introduce a temporary top-up payment for Qualified Children (€30 per week for children over 12 and €15 per week for children under 12) to help families with the additional cost of food, electricity, internet and communication services, educational resources and indoor social activities." I double up as the spokesperson on education for my party. One of the things we are hearing about quite a bit at the moment is the digital divide that exists in homes. One of the compounding issues is the existence of poverty. It is not just the digital divide, but also increased poverty associated with electricity and broadband costs. Is it possible to provide an additional payment to parents to assist them with these costs that are increasing deprivation?</p>

          <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_453">The Deputy raised several issues. On the issue of the public-facing campaign to which he referred, we have been providing flexibility with regard to rent supplement. The Deputy and I can probably get the message out to people who contact us that if they are in difficulty, the Department is here to help. That is the one big message we need to send out. If people are having difficulties, whether that is with the cost of fuel or their rent supplement, they should go to their local social welfare office. We are here to try to help people through what is a very difficult time.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> The Deputy mentioned a temporary top-up payment for qualified children. That is another issue. I think it is No. 7. I increased the rate for qualified children under 12 and those over 12 in the budget, as the Deputy will be aware. The National One Parent Family Alliance is looking for support in respect of the cost of Internet, communication services and several other matters. That issue is best addressed in a targeted way rather than across the board. That is what the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is for. Indeed, many Deputies will know that the supplementary welfare scheme was established in the 1970s by Frank Cluskey, who was a Minister at the time, exactly for that purpose, that is, so that people who find themselves in difficulty can go to their social welfare office and get help. That is the most important message we can get out to people.</p>

          <p eId="para_455">Although the Minister and I can absolutely get that message out there, a sustained campaign run by her Department, whether through Facebook advertisements or whatever other way in which it can reach people, would be most welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> No. 9 calls on the Minister to "Prioritise lone parents in the provision of childcare services for essential workers and extend access to childcare facilities to all working lone parents of preschool and school-age children in line with public health advice." Obviously, that is motivated by several factors, but we must remember that many of the parents in one-parent families work in supermarkets or as SNAs. If they are expected to go to work, then we absolutely have to be able to provide them with childcare. Is that something on which the Minister's Department can provide assistance?</p>

          <p eId="para_459">Making a double payment of fuel allowance means everybody gets it whether they need it or not. The best way we can deal with that issue is through a targeted approach. If a person is in trouble with regard to the cost of fuel - the allowance was increased by €3.50 only at the beginning of the year - he or she should go to the local social welfare office and look for the supplementary payment because it is available specifically to help people who run into difficulties.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">I listened to Deputy Gannon very respectfully put his points to the Minister. He asked solid questions and got solid answers. It was all very respectful. However, minutes earlier, I could not believe my ears while listening to Deputy Guirke. His final contribution was to state "I do not care if the Minister does not like Sinn Féin or does not like me, but she should show a bit of respect and fairness for the people of Meath West." When did she say that she does not like the Deputy, Sinn Féin or Meath West? I am not here to defend the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, but let us be fair to this Parliament. Let us not totally debase our contributions here. Deputy Guirke's comments are absolutely absurd. Comments will circulate on Facebook in Meath West tonight, stating that Minister Humphreys hates the county and she hates Deputy Guirke because he is the Sinn Féin representative for the constituency. That is total tripe. Dáil Éireann is much better than that. In the same vein that Deputy Gannon finished his contribution, I will be respectful in addressing this Chamber and the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> The unemployment rate in my county of Clare is rather alarming. It has been one of the highest in the country through the past 12 months or so. In September 2019, the rate was 8.2% whereas in November 2020 it was 22.6%. It is all very fluid and volatile. The increase in the unemployment rate can largely be pinned on Covid, although there are other factors such as the airport and many things in the mid-west that are unique to the area. I ask the Minister and her Department to keep a close eye on the whole Shannon, Limerick and Ennis axis. She was in the area last year and visited the Molex factory. She knows how dependent the mid-west is on that kind of industry hub base between towns in the mid-west and the airport. I ask her to keep a close eye on that in the months ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> I refer to Tús, the CE scheme and the rural social scheme. Many of the schemes are not being referred with new names by the Department. The schemes are winding down and nearing expiration and they are not being provided with new names. I am thinking specifically of two fabulous schemes in my county, those in Ballynacally and Lissycasey, which have really enhanced the community. They are winding down as they are not getting referrals of new names. I ask specifically that the departmental officials who are present might look at those schemes and get referrals out to them. Continuation would be ideal in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> I wish to briefly address the issue of businesses and individuals that continue to fall between two stools. I know this strictly is not within the remit of the Minister's Department but there are many overlapping functions in this area at the moment. I am thinking specifically of the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, because there is still an issue for many sole traders who work from the home. Eamon Andrews, who lives in my community, is a photographer who works from his car boot with a laptop, a tripod and a camera. He does not have a physical premises and none of the supports so far have benefited him. There are still people falling between the stools.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> Another issue of significant concern relates to ferry and boat operators. I was contacted last night by Shannon Ferries and Killaloe River Cruises, which runs boats that go up and down the River Shannon. Those companies have fallen outside many of the supports put in place by the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social Protection and Revenue. They are falling between the stools and they really need the CRSS to be extended to encompass entities that are semi-dependent on tourism but also provide vital transport links. The companies in question are kind of falling between Departments. I ask that the Minister champion their cause. I think she gets how difficult their scenario is. Shannon Ferries has been operating for 52 years but it is now really struggling. Although it is not on the brink, it will need Government support as it continues to support the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> I will raise two final points and I would appreciate it if the Minister could respond in the remainder of my time before I pass over to Deputy Durkan. Responsibility for SUSI grants rests with the Minister's Department to a certain extent as there are elements of paperwork that are furnished by the Department. However, the difficulties that people have had in the past year are not being fully taken into account. The years do not perfectly align with the calendar year from 1 January to 31 December. There has been a shock to the economy as a result of Covid and that needs to be taken into account. A business that was going quite well on 28 January 2020 may have been decimated by now. </p>
          <p eId="para_467"> The final issue I wish to raise is that of PPS numbers. There is still a real lag in PPS numbers being generated by the Department. Many people are still waiting on PPS numbers and I ask for that to be examined. I ask the Minister to briefly respond to some of those issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_469"> I recognise that there are issues with regard to referrals. Intreo offices are only operating at 30% at the moment in terms of their referral capacity. That will be ramping up soon. If the Deputy wishes to contact me directly regarding specific projects, we can speak to local community development officers about them.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">I understand the Deputy's concerns regarding the photographer to whom he referred, for example. It is worth noting that self-employed people on the PUP can earn €960 over eight weeks and still retain their PUP payment. That may be some help to them. For those who are coming off the PUP, we have an enterprise support grant of €1,000. I know there probably is not much demand for that now, given the current restrictions, but it will continue to be available.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">I know that the Tánaiste is looking at supports for people who did not fit into any of the categories we currently have and I will certainly raise the matter with him. </p>
          <p eId="para_472"> I am familiar with the mid-west region and understand that it has been hit hard by Covid-19, the hospitality sector in particular. We will be doing all we can to support those affected.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State for their response to the Covid threat. Those congratulations apply to the Government in general. I also congratulate the previous Government. This pandemic is an unprecedented attack on our society that still continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> I echo the words of a number of other people when I say that in the event that some of the support schemes terminate on a specific date, it would be helpful if those availing of the schemes could be given advice well in advance as to the prospect of the schemes' continuation. The requirements of households continue regardless of whether deadlines have come or gone. That is something that could be of great benefit to people who are dependent on the supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department for how they have dealt with queries. That applies particularly to appeals. Most appeals have been dealt with administratively and satisfactorily. That is a good thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> The Minister referred to the availability of exceptional needs payments and I agree with her. That is what they are there for. I spent a small time in that Department some years ago and used to advise people on that subject. However, it is important that the response from the individual concerned is not always the same. That needs to be looked at, not in a critical way but in a way that simply addresses issues that might arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> The last point I want to make relates to something that still puzzles me. It has not happened in recent times but it did happen over the past couple of years. There have been cases where someone won an appeal and the appeal was subsequently overturned by a higher executive officer. I have my doubts about that because two of the things that always prevailed in the Department were due process and natural justice. Overpayments have always happened for one reason or another, including people not reading the regulations properly and so on. It was always possible that where a person received an overpayment and it subsequently transpired that he or she did not qualify for the payment which was the question of the overpayment but did qualify for an alternative payment at the same time, that was taken as being an underlying reason for granting the alternative payment. That has been discontinued over the past couple of years and I have not seen evidence of it in recent times. That was a part of the ethos of natural justice of the Department. The Minister and the Minister of State might look at that when they get a chance, notwithstanding the existence of other challenges.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">I thank the Deputy for raising those issues. I know that he has a great knowledge of the social protection scheme and I take on board the issue he has raised about appeals and their overturning. I commit to looking at that issue and will be happy to speak to him about it. If he has a specific case in mind, I am happy to discuss it with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> The Department of Social Protection is here to help people. Our number one objective is to help people when they need it and provide security for when someone is off sick or retires. We cover every aspect of people's lives. There is not one family in this country that social protection will not touch at some stage in their lives. The staff of the Department work extremely hard and treat people in a humane way. That said, there may be an odd occasion when difficulties arise and that is why the appeals mechanism is there. The message I want to get out, loud and clear, is that we are here to help people and will not be found wanting. It is fair to say that the Government has not been found wanting in the pandemic unemployment supports it has put in place. We have paid €5.5 million since the pandemic unemployment payment started last March. We extended it when it needed to be extended and kept it open for people so they did not have to worry that if they lost their jobs they would not get back onto the PUP. We have kept it open and people have been able to reapply for it. We will continue to support people insofar as we need to during this pandemic. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">The pandemic has forced us all to re-examine the way we view social protection. None of us would have imagined a situation where hundreds of thousands of workers were going to be laid off or lose their jobs and be forced to stay out of work for months.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> I listened to the Minister's speech. She spoke about the extended lockdown, the need to once again flatten the curve and protect the vaccine roll-out. We cannot strip away supports and benefits that allow workers and their families to observe restrictions and stay at home, where possible. Can we take it as read that the PUP is to be continued as long as the Covid restrictions keep businesses from operating? Does the Ceann Comhairle want to take questions one-by-one or as a group?</p>

My Department is working on the relevant IT system. We are working hard to have it ready by the beginning of April.

          <p eId="para_488">The long-term health effect of Covid, so-called long Covid, has yet to be determined. Initial indications are that the lifelong impact of the virus may be severe. Is the Department of Social Protection examining the possibility of a Covid disability payment or long-term enhanced illness payment, should the need arise?</p>

          <p eId="para_489">As the Deputy knows, we brought in Covid illness benefit for the purpose of allowing people to take time off work immediately once they got certification from their doctor. Whether they were off sick or had to isolate, a doctor could still electronically certify that the person in question should not be in work and the payment kicked in straight away, without waiting days. That is a payment of €350.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> We need to consider that the average period for which people are sick and receive that payment is three weeks, approximately 21 days. That is why the enhanced illness benefit is available for up to ten weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">People have asked about those who get Covid and who are sick for longer than ten weeks, but it is fair to say that there are individuals who have other illnesses and who are sick for much longer than ten weeks as well. We must be fair when we are looking at this so that people who have other long-term illnesses are treated equitably and that everybody is treated in a fair way. The reason the payment was brought in was to stop the transmission of the virus and to allow people to take time off work. It is still there for that purpose. If people are not feeling well and they think they have been in contact with a positive case, they should get in touch with a doctor and get the payment straight away. These are the rules. I will consider what the Deputy is saying, but I must look at it in the context of other citizens who have long-term illnesses as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">I have two questions for the Minister. The first is on extended parental leave. In the list of priority legislation for spring, we are told that the heads of the parents' leave and benefits (amendment) Bill have been approved but that a timeframe for pre-legislative scrutiny is still to be determined. The National Women's Council of Ireland and others are waging a campaign to have the legislation introduced. The drafting of a general scheme was a very weak response last year from the Government to a major campaign launched by women to have maternity leave extended during Covid, which was refused by the Government. They were then told that this legislative measure would be forthcoming but it has still not been introduced. Most of those women who fought then have either been forced back to or out of employment because of the difficulties with working and the inaccessibility of childcare. We now have a new cohort of parents coming on board. When is the anticipated legislation due to be published or is this a ball that is being kicked between the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Minister present? Could we get a date for publication and clarification that the leave in question can be taken before the legislation is enacted?</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> I acknowledge the increase in the fuel allowance in January to €28 a week for the 360,000 people who are dependent on it. However, these are extraordinary times and the Minister and I know there are many people aged over 60, 70 and 80 who we are advising to stay at home. The weather is very cold and damp and they have to scrimp and scrape on the heating because the fuel allowance is inadequate. While they are at risk and while the situation is still dangerous for them, we ask that the fuel allowance would be doubled from €28 to €56. Also, as a matter of urgency, could the Minister deal with the local authorities who control the heating in many of the older person's complexes and turn it off at 11 p.m. or midnight despite very cold weather where they have to endure cold conditions in their apartments overnight? It does not happen in every block of apartments, but we need a universal reaction across all local authorities to how we deal with older persons in accommodation with centrally controlled heating.</p>

          <p eId="para_499">I will respond first to the issue concerning local authorities. We will raise the issue with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and perhaps he will take it up with them or we could directly contact the local authority concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> As Deputy Bríd Smith said, we did increase the fuel allowance and €3.50 extra has been paid from January. The supplementary welfare allowance is available for people who find themselves in difficulty. If people are in trouble and they cannot pay their fuel bill, they should contact their local Intreo office and assistance will be made available to them. People have to explain their circumstances and the case will be discussed but the support is there for those who genuinely need it.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">Parents are at their wits' end trying to juggle work and childcare during the lockdown, with no support from the State. They are expected to double job, to hold down their regular work while also home schooling. Many are simply not able to do that. They have run through their annual leave already. They are being told by the Department to leave their job and go on the PUP. Other countries in Europe have brought in new entitlements to paid childcare leave from work to deal with the situation. Does the Minister not agree that it is about time we did the same? Germany, for example, has just introduced an extra ten days' paid leave per parent to enable them to mind children at home because of Covid measures such as school closures, illness or self-isolation. Austria, Italy, Portugal and Slovenia have also all introduced paid leave for parents with children. In France, parents affected by school closures or a child having to self-isolate are entitled to paid sick leave from work, yet here parents were told by the Department in a tweet this month:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_508">Workers affected by a lack of childcare should engage with their employer with a view to exploring all options available to enable them to return to, or continue with, work where possible</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_509">Where there are no options possible they are eligible to apply for the PUP.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> Once again, it is women who are hardest hit by this, shouldering the bulk of the childcare work and suffering the greatest job losses. During the first lockdown last year women were disproportionately affected by job losses and right now we have a higher rate of unemployment of women than men for the first time in many years. What is the Minister doing to help parents, especially mothers, remain in the workforce and to assist them with their additional childcare responsibilities during Covid? Will she give parents a break and introduce a special Covid parental or childcare benefit like in Germany and other EU countries?</p>

          <p eId="para_511">Parental leave is the responsibility of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and his Department and my Department make the necessary payments. To be helpful to parents, where they could not go to work due to childcare commitments, the Deputy is correct that in the first instance we encouraged them to engage with their employer. Some employers have been very good, and we must acknowledge that. They have allowed parents to work flexible hours and they have been able to balance looking after families, home schooling and also doing their work. It is not easy, but they have been able to do that. For those people who could not avail of those arrangements with their employer, we said they could self-certify and apply for the pandemic unemployment payment. I would encourage parents who are in that situation to avail of the support that is available currently.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">That is fair enough. I will make a few general observations and leave it to my colleagues to ask the questions. We will give the Minister a break from questions. I join with her and other speakers in congratulating the staff of the Department of Social Protection on the wonderful work they have been doing during the pandemic. I say a special word of thanks and congratulations to local staff in Limerick who have performed with unfailing courtesy and provided help above and beyond the call of duty. I thank them for the great patience and forbearance they have displayed in spite of all the annoyance we have inflicted on them in recent months.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> I was a little disturbed by the Minister's response to the question about the continuation of the PUP from the end of March.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Everybody knows that the lockdown in some shape or form, possibly its present form, is going to continue beyond the end of March and naturally the PUP should be extended to account for that. People are exhausted and under enormous pressure. There is a great deal of evidence that people's mental health has been affected by these continuous lockdowns. What people are looking for from me, and indeed from colleagues on all sides of the House, is a bit of certainty. If the country is still locked down and people still cannot go to work after 31 March, will the PUP remain in place or will people have to fall back on the basic rate of social welfare? If the PUP does stay in place, what rates will apply? I took careful note of what the Minister said in this regard. She said that the Government will not be found wanting and I shall communicate that to all of the people who get in touch with my office but those people would prefer a little more certainty. While I acknowledge that the Minister must consult her Cabinet colleagues, I urge her to come to a decision on this soon because it will give those people who are under significant pressure one less thing to worry about.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> I listened carefully to the questions and answers earlier but I did not hear anyone mentioning the vexed question of the over-66s. When the PUP was introduced, people over the age of 66 were specifically and definitively excluded. We all know people over the age of 66 who were self-employed - wet publicans spring to mind immediately - or employed and who continued to work. It is a growing phenomenon in society. As people live longer, more and more of them are working beyond the age of 66. Some people in that category qualify for the old age pension because they have paid their contributions over the years but others do not. Whether they are getting the pension or not, the reality is that as a result of the Government's necessary action to close down the economy to protect public health, they have been deprived of income they previously enjoyed. If they happened to be a day under the age of 66 when this kicked in, they were fine but if they were a day over the age of 66, they were automatically disqualified. The Minister said she was doing her very best to ensure that everything was being done fairly and equitably in all sectors but there is blatant discrimination against people over the age of 66. I want more people over the age of 66, if they are mentally and physically fit, continuing to work because that will take much pressure off the pension system. In some occupations people can work beyond the age of 66 but in others, they cannot. Building labourers, for example, are literally worn out at 55 or 60 and it would be cruel to expect them to work up to the age of 68, 69 or 70. People aged 66 should be entitled to retire with a full pension if they wish but we want to encourage more of them to stay in work. We also want to remove or outlaw those ridiculous contracts that compel people to retire at 65. If that step was taken, together with progressing the pensions auto-enrolment system, which seems to have fallen into some sort of Bermuda triangle, it would relieve much of the financial pressure that keeping the pension age at 66 would impose.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> I am sorry to have to disagree with my colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, with regard to the question of taxing the PUP. When the PUP was introduced and was in operation for several months, there was no question whatsoever of it being taxed. Then the Government decided to tax it, presumably on the basis that other social welfare payments are taxable in the sense that one's tax credits are reduced by the amount of the social welfare payment. However, the PUP falls into a completely different category. It is completely different from other social welfare payments in many ways. The Government introduced it initially on the basis that it would be at the same rate as basic social welfare payments but soon realised that some of the people who were losing their jobs were earning, in net terms, two, three or four times what they would have received on social welfare. It, therefore, raised the rate to €350 per week so that the fall in income would not be too steep. The rate is different as are the conditions to qualify for the PUP. Social welfare is something that can continue indefinitely but the PUP is temporary. It is a temporary emergency payment and the idea that the Government would come back, months after it has been introduced, and decide unilaterally to tax it retrospectively makes absolutely no sense. </p>

While they are not directly on the battlefield, as such, they are very essential front-line workers and they responded tremendously to a national emergency, pulling out all of the stops. We are fortunate to have a large social protection office in Longford town, under principal officers, Christine Gilligan and Brian Molloy, and the team there provided an exceptional service across a number of sections. It would be extremely remiss of me not to acknowledge their dedication and commitment in the face of the Covid-19 crisis over the past ten months.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> As others have said, the Covid-19 support payments have been a critical lifeline for many and it was important that payments were released as quickly as possible. However, there are a number of ongoing issues, which I hope the Minister can resolve. Some people are still trying to rectify back pay issues. I appreciate that there was a considerable backlog of applications and additional staff were brought in. Tremendous inroads have been made in addressing the backlog but there are still some outstanding cases. I would like the Minister to provide a firm date for the resolution of back pay issues from 2020. </p>
          <p eId="para_522"> I have issues with the decision to back tax the PUP. As others said, when it was introduced it was not a social welfare payment in the strictest sense as it was very much an emergency payment and a lifeline. The benefit for the Government and the Exchequer of taxing both the PUP and the wage subsidy scheme is questionable. It has been a divisive move that has angered many people. Nobody wished Covid on the country and nobody wanted to stop working because of Covid. We should take a sense-check on this and assess it. Certainly, in terms of what Revenue is saying, the net benefit from this tax is minimal. It was a retrograde step and while I appreciate that it is not fully within the remit of the Department of Social Protection, I urge the Minister to raise it at Cabinet level and review the decision. Workers have made significant sacrifices and we owe it to them to respond to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Others have mentioned the over-66s and I wish to refer to one small group within that cohort who have been adversely affected by Covid. I speak of people who turned 66 in 2020 and were due to get their State pension. One of my constituents turned 66 two weeks after registering for the PUP and another lady had a seven-week wait. In both instances they did not qualify for the PUP because they were going to get a pension later in the year but had no income for several weeks. While it may be a small number of people and involve a small amount, there is a principle at stake and I ask the Minister to examine this. </p>
          <p eId="para_524"> I have previously communicated with her on the issue of the inclusion of all families in receipt of the working family payment in the Christmas bonus scheme. This issue came to a head again last Christmas. The Government correctly decided to include Covid payment recipients in the Christmas bonus scheme. As it stands, some recipients of the working family payment got the Christmas bonus as it was paid concurrently with other social welfare payments such as the one-family payment but a small number were excluded and I would ask the Minister to examine this as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> A large number of people engaged with the Department for the first time in their lives in the last year. It has been a hugely difficult time for them. The road to recovery is going to be very difficult and I do not see a situation where the tap is turned off on the Covid payments. As we seek to help businesses to reopen and communities to rebuild, these payments will be needed in one form or another.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">In conjunction with the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister will have to retain some level of payment to help businesses and workers return to normality, particularly in our most marginalised and rural locations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_527">At the outset, I too express my gratitude to the front-line workers in the Department of Social Protection. I thank them all, particularly those in Mayo and the west, for all of their help and for doing the massive job they have had to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> I will ask the Minister a couple of questions. The first is on community employment schemes. Could contracts under such schemes be extended to, for example, 31 December to provide some certainty? The Minister needs to engage directly with organisations on the ground and to show some flexibility with respect to local needs and the make-up of the unemployed population in particular years. I fear that we are fixing things that are not broken and are ignoring things that are. That can be solved very easily with dialogue, discussion and common sense. </p>
          <p eId="para_529"> On the PUP, there are arrears owing and problems with the IT system. I would appreciate it if the Minister would look at those issues. I know she understands the stress and anxiety these delays are causing. People are waiting and checking their bank accounts every day to see if their money has arrived. That is just not right in the circumstances in which we are. We have talked about those aged over 66 many times. Most such people would not have been working if they did not really need to do so. It is grossly unfair to exclude them. I ask the Minister to look at that matter again. My concern about the PUP is that the Minister is giving it with one hand and taking it back with another through taxation. The PUP was initially described as an urgent needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are not taxable. I cannot see the difference between "urgent" and "exceptional". We really need to look at that because presenting more than 200,000 people with tax bills of up to €1,400 is just absolutely wrong. There is no case for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> With regard to the impact of the PUP on medical cardholders, has the Minister's Department cross-checked with the Department of Health to see how many people have lost their medical cards as a result of the PUP? That would be a poverty-proofing exercise well worth doing. </p>
          <p eId="para_531"> The Minister talked about a pathway to employment. I take it that this also applies to farmers. Young farmers face great difficulty in accessing green certificate courses. In Mayo, something like 200 places were available on a further education course in Westport but there were 900 applicants. All of these young farmers are locked out at a time when we want them to take up farming. We need to take down these barriers and to create extra places on such courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> Finally, it is grossly wrong that social welfare recipients are locked out of the 2016 incremental tenant purchase scheme and are not allowed to purchase their own homes, even if they have the means to do so, purely because they are dependent on social welfare.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe O'Brien<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_533">On community employment schemes, as the Deputy will know, since level 5 restrictions were introduced in October of last year, contracts have been extended until at least 31 March of this year. We will be monitoring the situation closely. We are open to extending it beyond that. I will also clarify that there is to be no sudden cliff edge when contracts come towards an end. The local community development officers in the Department will stagger the end of contracts to make sure that services are not impacted. It is fair to say that more communication and flexibility on the ground is needed. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I met 25 of the sponsor organisations during the week. There was much feedback and back and forth. Recently, one of the constraints has been that capacity at a local level among Intreo and community development officers is down to 30% because of staff being pulled in a different direction. I expect that staffing level to increase again and that engagement between sponsors and community development officers will increase over time as the economy opens up.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_534">I am sharing time with Deputy Verona Murphy. I will take four minutes and she will have four and a half. The Minister recently brought a memorandum to Cabinet proposing the extension of the pandemic unemployment payment scheme until the end of March. This is very welcome news and an action I support. In light of the extended lockdown, and the prospect that it could be extended even further, will the Minister confirm that the pandemic unemployment payment will be extended beyond the end of March? As she knows, the number of people receiving the pandemic unemployment payment has now reached 475,000, with more than 15,000 added in the last week alone. These workers would be still in work today but, because of the Covid pandemic and through no fault of their own, they are now effectively unemployed. We must continue to support these workers in these extremely challenging times and confirming that the pandemic unemployment payment will be extended beyond March would at least give these workers some peace of mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> It should be remembered that these workers still have to pay their rent and their mortgages and that their household bills have not gone away. The pandemic unemployment payment, while very welcome, is still a good deal less than what the vast majority would have earned if still in employment. It would be very helpful to confirm that the pandemic unemployment payment will be extended beyond March should we still be in lockdown which, unfortunately, looks very likely.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> Another issue I will raise with the Minister today is that of cross-Border workers and their entitlement to social welfare benefits when they are let go as a result of Covid. As the Minister knows, thousands of workers cross the Border each day to go work. Thousands travel from the North to the South and thousands more travel from the South to the North for work purposes. Will the Minister confirm what entitlements southern workers have to social welfare when working in the North but who are temporarily laid off as a result of Covid? They pay their taxes and national insurance contributions in the North. Will the Minister confirm if they are entitled to the pandemic unemployment payment? Are they required to apply for assistance in the North? Will the Minister also confirm what entitlements workers from Northern Ireland who work and pay taxes and PRSI here in the South have when it comes to social welfare benefits? Are they entitled to receive the pandemic unemployment payment? As someone from Dundalk, which is in a Border county, these are the questions I am being asked. I would appreciate it if the Minister would answer them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_537">The PUP scheme is due to run until the end of March. The Government has never been found wanting in supporting workers through this payment. Together with my Government colleagues, I will assess the situation. We are still not out of January. People know that they will get the payment for February and March. We have always supported the workers and we will continue to do so but, obviously, we will have to take account of the situation at that time, which will depend on the trajectory of the virus, the roll-out of the vaccine and where we are with regard to the reopening of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> With regard to frontier workers, I understand the point the Deputy is making. If one is working in Northern Ireland and living in the Republic of Ireland, one is entitled to the pandemic unemployment payment at our rates. If one is living in Northern Ireland and working south of the Border, one must apply for the supports in the country in which one is resident. I want to be clear on that because I know there has been conversations about it and I do understand. People tell me that they are working in the South and paying tax there, so they should be entitled to unemployment support there. That is not the way it works, however. It is agreed right across Europe that people get unemployment benefit in the country in which they are resident. That is the situation. I just wanted to clarify that for the Deputy.</p>

        <speech by="#VeronaMurphy" eId="spk_296">
          <from>Deputy Verona Murphy<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_539">I do not have questions to be answered. I would like to make a broader statement because of the Minister's senior Cabinet position and her broader knowledge based on her previous experience in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. I am sure that, like myself, both Ministers have been inundated with calls and queries from worried retailers at various stages over the last year or so. We must now look at how to support these retailers to remain open in the medium to long term and to keep as many people as possible in employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">There needs to be an interdepartmental examination of the fallout, which will have significant consequences for the Departments for which the Minister and Minister of State have responsibility, namely, the Departments of Social Protection and Rural and Community Development. Unfortunately, it looks as though we will be closed for a number of months at least before most retail outlets will be permitted to reopen. Now is the time that we need to be preparing our support system. It would be irresponsible if not immoral, were the Government to simply cast such businesses to one side with no support to help them get back on their feet.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> County Wexford is one of the counties that has been hardest hit by unemployment in Ireland. Our unemployment rate is now the fifth highest in the country. A large percentage of the jobs in County Wexford are in the retail, tourism and hospitality sectors. Businesses have gone to great lengths to satisfy Government requirements over the past year and most were greatly concerned when their businesses were ordered to close. To compensate for their inconvenience, the Government must be there with a support system. This means there needs to be clear engagement with the sector in order that we do not end up with thousands of people being stuck on the PUP because of a lack of support to businesses. The narrow scope of the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, is partly responsible for the number of PUP claimants from the sector. Wholesalers, catering businesses and the entertainment sectors are all left out of the CRSS. </p>
          <p eId="para_542"> Many retailers also face stocking issues. In the boutique sector, for example, it is rolling stock over while trying to pay on finance for the next season. Many of these boutiques will have ordered spring stock for 2021 at the end of the summer of 2020. While it has been bought and paid for, yet they cannot open. They will also be buying stock for next winter shortly and it is just a continuous cycle. Many are now having to pay VAT and even, in some cases, massive delivery increases because their supplies are coming from the UK. </p>
          <p eId="para_543"> These are the realities facing the retail sector and we need a plan to support the businesses in dealing with the issues I have outlined, such as those enterprises that are outside the scope of the CRSS. There are anomalies in the CRSS and now is the time to examine them and sort them out. The scheme needs to be broadened and the Minister’s Department can surely identify from which sectors people are signing on to the PUP. We need to ensure that the anomalies are addressed and that support is available to see that the jobs remain sustainable. I recognise this might be a short-term cost burden for the Department but if we allow these problems to develop, it will be a far greater cost in the long run, with jobs and businesses collapsing. The problem is very much linked to rural development. It is becoming increasingly difficult to run a town centre business in rural Ireland and Covid-19 has made that an even bigger challenge. </p>
          <p eId="para_544"> Those facing the gravest challenges are also those on Pobal supports. A variety of community projects that are vital to rural Ireland are now struggling to survive. One such project close to my heart in New Ross is St. Michael’s Theatre. It can access neither the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, nor the CRSS, it is generating no income and its Pobal funding falls far short of what is needed if it is to survive this extended lockdown. There is no system in place to adjudicate cases outside of the CRSS beyond Revenue and had all these people been accommodated, we may have been able to look forward to the future with many more businesses being able to reopen. </p>
          <p eId="para_545"> In conclusion, I understand that this is a very fast-moving situation and it is not always possible to get everything right. I also understand how hard the Department staff are working and I join with my colleague, Deputy O’Dea, in saying that we have had great support from the social protection staff in our local offices. I ask the Minister and Minister of State to consider these issues at Cabinet level.</p>

        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Deputy Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_546">I am sharing time equally with my colleague, Deputy Pádraig O’Sullivan. In the first instance I thank the Minister and the staff in her Department, as well as all the staff throughout the country for the work they have done at a very difficult period in dealing with and delivering payments to people in a fast and efficient way. While there have been glitches in the system, the staff have responded to and dealt with those glitches also.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> There are two areas I wish to touch upon and to which serious consideration should be given. I have come across a number of people who have had to give up work because a member of their family has been diagnosed with a very serious illness requiring full-time care. Rather than having that person in a hospital setting or in a hospice, the family members instead kept them at home and provided full-time care. There is not an immediate response of support for someone who has given up their job in order to provide that care. That is something that should be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> There have also been situations with elderly parents where the home help and support services that such people receive in normal times is not now available because of Covid-19 for various reasons, especially in rural areas, where one has a limited number of people available to provide home care. People are again having to give up jobs to look after their elderly parents and are not able to access payments. This should also be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> The second issue I wish to touch on is in respect of people who are long-term carers who do not have an entitlement to a pension other than a non-contributory old age pension. I am talking about people who may have been outside of the workforce for 25 years for various reasons. They may have someone who has an intellectual disability, or may have elderly parents who they had to look after and then find when they come to the qualifying age for the old age pension, the time that they have put in as carers is not taken into account, even though providing that care has been a full-time job for them. I have seen quite a number of people who are at a serious loss because if they are living with someone who is in receipt of any kind of income, be it old age pension or whatever, the person is means-tested. Long-term carers and their entitlement to an old age pension when they themselves retire is something that needs to be looked at. We must remember that there are now more than 500,000 carers dealing with different groups such as elderly people, members of people's own family such as brothers and sisters who require care or people's own children who have disabilities and to whom they are providing full-time care. I ask that the Minister give some consideration to those issues and respond to me in that regard.</p>

        <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_298" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
          <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_550">I thank the Deputy for raising those issues. In the first instance, if someone has had to give up work due to the need to provide full-time care for somebody at home, I strongly recommend that they apply for the carer's benefit because very generous assistance is available there. If the person has been paying their contributions they can apply for that payment to help them do that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> The second issue related to long-term full-time carers, that is, those who have been caring for many years, perhaps for somebody with disabilities, and have given their lives to looking after those people. In respect of such carers who have not been able to take up employment or had that opportunity, the points made by the Deputy are correct. I have asked the Pensions Commission to look at that issue because it affects women in particular. Women and mothers who have spent a lifetime looking after their children have been unable to take up employment for that very reason and do not have the credits when it comes to pension age and cannot get a contributory pension. I feel strongly about the need to look at this issue. It concerns in particular those who are providing full-time care because there are many different types of carers. There are carers who provide X number of hours a week and others who provide care 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Pensions Commission will look at that whole issue.</p>

        <speech by="#PadraigOSullivan" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_552">Initially, I wish to echo the calls of previous speakers regarding the PUP. I take some solace from the Minister's words that the Government has not been found wanting and, to be fair, that has been the case regarding the PUP, the wage subsidy scheme and other schemes that have been rolled out.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">I take some comfort from that, but I echo Deputy O'Dea Comments that people require certainty. I suppose it is hard to give certainty in the middle of a global pandemic, but where it can be given, it should be. The sooner we can make a decision on this aspect or indicate to the public what we intend to do, the better. It would give people great comfort.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> I acknowledge the work of social welfare staff across the country. In Cork city, as Deputy Burke alluded to earlier, those staff have been doing Trojan work and their interaction with my office has been brilliant. I acknowledge that good work. I came here today with one question on a specific issue, but I think it might have broader connotations for other people in similar situations. It concerns people who may be in receipt of carer's allowance or who may be caring for somebody with a physical or mental disability or special needs at home, as mentioned earlier, or somebody looking after an elderly parent. The difficulty we have is that many of those people also work part-time jobs as well as being in receipt of carer's allowance etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> I have come across several cases of people working part-time in care homes and nursing homes in situations where they have been front-line workers during this pandemic. The difficulty they now find themselves in, depending on the week or the month and as the virus has progressed, is that demand for such staff and services has increased and decreased and these people have sometimes found themselves working far beyond the 18.5 hours permissible under the social welfare entitlement they may be in receipt of. Ordinarily, they might not be allowed to exceed those 18.5 hours. In certain circumstances where the virus knocked out members of staff in a setting or if people had gone to work for the HSE, however, those people have now found themselves working beyond those permissible hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> Some of those people are now receiving letters from Revenue looking for them to be reassessed. Whether I might be regarded as asking for clemency, consideration or exemptions, whatever way we want to describe it, I think their situation needs to be looked on favourably, where possible. As I said, those people put their shoulders to the wheel as the pandemic progressed. In many situations, if they had refused to work beyond their permitted 18.5 hours many nursing homes would have been understaffed or without staff. I ask the Minister to respond to that aspect of this situation and I ask if any consideration is being given to people in those circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> I will leave the Minister with the last two minutes. I will take just 40 more seconds to say that, as the Minister knows, I spent much of my career teaching. At every opportunity, I have raised the free meals scheme in schools and listening to the opening remarks I am glad the scheme is to be extended throughout the length of the pandemic. That is welcome, but will the Minister consider extending that scheme, or reviewing it, for continuation even beyond Covid-19? The scheme now operates in schools, particularly DEIS schools, but deprivation is not specific to DEIS schools. It can be in all schools. In the 15 years I was teaching, I saw many children coming into school who would not have had a breakfast or a lunch but for getting those meals in school. We are in 2021 and there are many different households out there and many different people with different means. We must assess, as they are doing across the water in the UK, the possibility of rolling out the free meals scheme to all schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue concerning the carers who had to work more than 18 hours. I can fully understand the situation they have found themselves in, where they stayed an extra few hours to put their shoulder to the wheel to help in the ongoing efforts in respect of the pandemic, which was extremely difficult for them. I will certainly ask my officials to look at that issue and I will revert directly to the Deputy. It would not be right to penalise somebody who was doing something in an emergency situation, so I will certainly get my officials to examine this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> Regarding the school meals, I was pleased we kept the funding going. Many schools are availing of the schools meals programme and it is great they were able to continue on with it. I commend the work the schools have done and also the contractors who took on the job of delivering these meals, because sometimes they are delivered to the homes directly and sometimes they are delivered to the schools for collection. It certainly has made a difference to young people and children to get a substantial meal. I am anxious to continue and expand the scheme. More than a thousand schools have been helped through that programme. There is also the hot school meals programme, which I announced in the budget. We cannot start it immediately, but the request for expressions of interest has gone out and the process is underway. We have deferred the announcement because the schools are closed.</p>

          <p eId="para_561">In the brief time I have, I will highlight two categories of people facing challenges, namely, musicians and small business people. I am aware that in December, it was announced that self-employed people, including artists and musicians, in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment looking to restart their businesses can earn up to €960 over eight weeks, without their PUP being affected. The Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, however, which represents many musicians and entertainers, has stated that what is really needed is the reinstatement of the PUP at €350 per week, as well as the EWSS at €410 per week until the industry reopens without social distancing. The MEAI is also seeking legislation guaranteeing payment breaks from mortgages and loans from financial institutions and the creation of a survival package and scaffolding support structures for self-employed individuals and businesses. In her reply, the Minister might also update me on the MEAI call for a hardship fund to be created jointly by the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Arts Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> I also raise the issue of people who run small businesses. I am dealing with one constituent who runs a small business and she gets just €203 per week. As a result, she is falling behind in her payment of bills associated with the business. She has applied for the CRSS, but is still waiting for her application to be processed. In that context, will the rates being paid to people in that situation in respect of small businesses be reviewed? Will there also be a review of the criteria, which are too stringent for people running small businesses?</p>

          <p eId="para_564">We will let the Chair decide on that matter. I understood that the division of time was two and half minutes, two minutes and two minutes and that is what I am sticking to. Perhaps the Minister might have a chance to respond at the end.</p>

          <p eId="para_565">For the most part, Covid-related payments in the area of social protection have gone very well for most recipients. I acknowledge the provision of information on this subject, which Deputies were then able to pass on to employers and employees. It was very helpful. However, major difficulties remain for employers and employees. Some employers who do essential work cannot get people back to work because those employees might have underlying conditions or they may have to stay at home because their partner, husband or wife is in a front-line position. Those people cannot go back to work because they have no childcare facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> What happens to employers who need people to do the work? What can be done in that case? Staff must also be reassured that the PUP payment will not be taken from them if they do go back to work. People must also look at spending their holidays in Ireland and the revamping of the stay-and-spend tax rebates must be looked at again, in a similar format. Only €300,000 has been claimed under this scheme, yet €250 million was set aside for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_568">Regarding the PUP, it exists in tiers and it has been aligned to recipients' previous income. Turning to those people who cannot go to work because of caring duties, we have stated that, in the first instance, they should try to work with their employers to try to find a way to work around the difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">In fairness, many employers have done that and have worked with their employees so they could work flexible hours and try to balance everything. This is not easy for anybody. With regard to those who cannot go to work or cannot get other child care arrangements, the PUP is available to people who cannot get to work and who would not get paid by their employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> Of course, this is a difficult time for everybody. I understand the point about the music industry and that people have been unemployed for a long time. It is not easy for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">I have many questions on the topic but I have broken them down into two for the Minister. With regard to CE participants, many organisations desperately need such people for Meals on Wheels and other projects. Please God as we move out of this Covid pandemic we will need them further because the projects will not have the funds to take on staff. People who are aged between 55 and 60 are now limited strictly to three years on a CE scheme. During Covid, this should be extended because organisations are in desperate need for these workers to continue. These workers will find it almost impossible to get employment elsewhere. Is the Minister looking into that?</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> Outdoor businesses pay taxes and have complied with all of the regulations but they still cannot receive CRSS payments. This is totally unacceptable. I am referring to caravan and campsites and companies that provide outdoor activities in west Cork. Surely these businesses are entitled to CRSS payments. Why are they not included? I would appreciate an answer to these two questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_573">On the CE schemes and those people who have hit the three-year limit, the current rules are, generally, that after a one year break they can requalify. Since level 5 restrictions kicked in during October 2020, there has been a stall on the closing of all CE contracts for participants. Currently, that extension is going at least until the end of March and beyond. When the country reopens then the agreements will be closed on a staggered basis so that the essential services referred to by the Deputy will not be hit.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">I have just a few questions, to which I hope answers can be given within the three and a half minutes I have.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> I have asked the Department for its views on areas of social deprivation and how the prevalence of Covid-19 is impacting these areas around the country. A recent study by the Donegal Women’s Network reinforces some of the issues I raised with the Minister about deprivation and the impacts of Covid-19. The North, reportedly, already has this information. What are her views on this? Will she take in this information as part of her work?</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> I turn to the matter of enhanced illness benefit for people who are extremely medically vulnerable. The Government has said that all employers have been putting the health and safety of employees front and centre during this pandemic, but this is not the case. I have been contacted by one worried wife and mother who told me that her husband's employer has not facilitated him to work from home and has continued to insist that he work in a customer-facing role. At that start of all of this, when cocooning guidelines were first issued by NPHET, he took that advice and stayed at home. His employer did not offer to pay him or arrange for him to work from home even though it would have been possible. Instead, this man was able to claim the €350 rate of PUP. Now it has been cut to €203 per week. For people in these situations is it possible that the PUP could be reinstated to €350 per week?</p>

          <p eId="para_577">On the first point, we have taken the Deputy's question on board. There is an issue with comparing data that the HSE and Pobal have. We are looking at other data sources also because before jumping into a big piece of research there is quite a great deal of information in different Departments and agencies. We are trying to see what we have got before we go on to that stage. As I said in my opening statement, when we are considering the impacts of Covid on people who are socially excluded, there are three areas we can examine. The first area is vaccine access. I believe we are quite good on that side with equity of access. Then there is the area of infection rates and mortality. There are questions to be asked there and perhaps research to be done at some stage on underlying health conditions and health inequalities that have fed up the line and caused higher mortality rates. Then there is the wider area of the impacts of the health restrictions. One can look at pretty much every sector of society in that regard, including education and disability services. It is quite broad but we are considering what we have got before we make the next step on it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_578">I first need to acknowledge the work being done by the people in the Department of Social Protection over the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> Is there any intention to consider those who have businesses and who are pension age or over? They were not entitled to the PUP even though they had money borrowed. Is there any intention to change that?</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> One of the vaccines we had hung our hat on is not being recommended in Germany for people over the age of 65. This could prolong our situation in Ireland. Will there be a commitment to continue the PUP as long as possible? It is imperative because if we do not keep the supports there for all the different employers around the country while they are closed, we will pay more in PUP and other social welfare payments in the future. Employers are under ferocious pressure with regard to rates and overhead charges. Will the Government commit to making sure these supports are continued? The simple reason is that there will be no jobs if the employers are gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> On carers, I note what the Minister of State said earlier in response to Deputy Colm Burke. I have seen instances such as the person who works in Dublin and then goes home as a carer to mind another person belonging to them, and is means-tested. We should understand that if a person is working and is means-tested sometimes he or she will not pass the means test even though he or she has given up work completely. This carer is saving the State €800 per week because he or she would get €200 but it is €1,000 per week in a nursing home. Will some process be brought in to simplify that?</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> On the CE schemes, because of the PUP and what we have gone through in the past year with the virus, can all of the people who were on the three-year schemes have their time extended rather than looking at a few schemes and giving the nod for a few months? It is more difficult at the moment for people to be interviewed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_583">I thank the Deputy for raising these issues. It is important to say that my Department has expended an additional €10.5 billion in supports through the PUP, TWSS and EWSS since the start of the pandemic. To be fair, the Government has not been found wanting in supporting businesses and in supporting people who have unfortunately found themselves out of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> A number of Deputies have raised the issue of extending the PUP. It has been extended until the end of March. I certainly will review it in consultation with my Government colleagues. We will consider where the virus is at, where the vaccination programme is at and whether we have been able to open up the economy. That decision will be looked at very carefully. It is fair to say, however, that the Government has not been found wanting in supporting people.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> The Deputy asked about carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I have spoken about this previously. The role of social protection is to give people a basic income. It does not pay people for the work they do. I get many questions about carers, and that is where there must be a more joined-up approach between my Department and the Department of Health. The Deputy is correct to say that carers are providing that service and that the costs may or may not be incurred by the State through the fair deal scheme or whatever supports are available. It is something we have to examine.</p>

        <speech by="#DarraghOBrien" as="#Minister_for_Housing,_Local_Government_and_Heritage" eId="spk_314">
          <from>Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Darragh O'Brien)<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_587">I am sharing time with the Ministers of State, Deputies Peter Burke and Noonan.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> In the 11 months since the first case of Covid-19 was recorded, our public services have been tested like never before. In this worst of times for so many, the best of public service and community spirit has come to the fore. The concept embodied in the Irish word "meitheal", daoine ag teacht le chéile chun obair a dhéanamh agus a gcuid fadhbanna a shárú or community co-operation in a time of social need, has been visibly lived across Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> At the outset, I must acknowledge the sustained efforts and commitment shown by the staff of my Department since the start of this emergency. From the first day, the rapid redeployment of staff and a roll-out of ICT equipment have kept our essential services operating and allowed for full remote working. The Department's Covid-19 response plan consolidates national best practice with specific reference to our several work locations across the country. In addition, the Department assimilated almost 500 new staff following the transfer of heritage functions to it in September, leading to an almost 50% increase in the size of the Department. The vast majority of departmental staff are working from home, as is the Government's advice, but a minority is required to attend physically at work to deliver key supports in areas such as ICT and in Met Éireann to provide weather forecasts and warnings, services to aviation and flood forecasting. The park rangers and the staff in the National Parks and Wildlife Service are arguably busier than ever with people exploring their local areas within the 5 km limit, restrictions permitting. All State bodies have taken large leaps in providing services in virtual, online ways, and this will be one of long-term positive legacies of the Covid-19 experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> In particular, I pay tribute to the members of the fire service throughout the country. As emergency responders, they are on the front line. I wish to mention especially the Dublin Fire Brigade paramedics, who are at the coalface of this pandemic. In addition, I pay tribute to all the staff in the 31 local authorities, many of whom are working in housing support and other crucial areas through the pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> The shutdown of construction has been extended to 5 March. This nine-week shutdown will undoubtedly have a significant impact on housing delivery. I am working with the Department to assess this impact, but we will not be found wanting in exploring all options to make up any shortfall.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> Regarding homelessness, we continue to protect the most vulnerable. That has been a key priority for me and my colleagues in the Department, especially those living in homelessness. The rapid and joined-up response by our homelessness services and their extraordinary commitment resulted in an unprecedented upscaling of services to keep users safe. To meet the challenges of social distancing, new facilities were rapidly opened. Shielding has been provided for those most at risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-19 and additional accommodation has been put in place to allow for self-isolation. Thankfully, outbreaks of Covid-19 have remained low among the homeless population, a testament to the hard work of all those involved in co-operation between the homelessness services and our colleagues in the HSE and the Department of Health. The response of service users to the supports provided, as measured by the HSE's national Covid-19 service user experience survey which reported last November, has been broadly positive. The needs and challenges expressed by service users in the survey will be integrated into service planning and this will inform the provision of more integrated, person-centred services for anyone experiencing homelessness in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> My Department has provided approximately €12.5 million per quarter in additional Covid-19-related funding to support these efforts. I have also provided for the further costs that have arisen from the provision of 24-hour services in facilities which were introduced to minimise the need for service users to travel. During this period we have made significant progress in tackling homelessness, although the situation is still challenging. The homeless figures for November show a decrease of 1,964 individuals or 18.8% on the total recorded in November 2019. Thankfully, there has been a 38.6% decrease in the number of families in emergency accommodation and a very welcome 72% reduction in the number of families accommodated in commercial hotels in the past year. We must do more, but more progress has been shown. The Dublin Region Homeless Executive recorded its highest number of tenancies created in a month last November, with 381 created in total. It is helping to prevent people from entering homelessness services as well as helping those who are engaged in them to exit successfully. The next quarterly report on homelessness will be published tomorrow, Friday, 29 January, and I expect to see a further reduction in the numbers of homeless individuals and families, which will be extremely welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> In budget 2021, we allocated €218 million for homelessness spending, an increase of 31% on budget 2020. With numbers falling we are moving towards long-term solutions, not just keeping our head above water. Rough sleepers are at the sharp end of homelessness and are among the most vulnerable individuals in society. Rough sleeping is a persistent issue and I have provided the resources to ensure there is a bed available for everyone who needs one. In addition, I have instructed all housing authorities that local connection criteria should not be a barrier to accessing services. I am keeping this under review to ensure it is adhered to. Enhanced outreach teams operate 18 hours per day, interacting with people on the street and encouraging them to take up offers of a bed or to return to accommodation they may already have. I thank and highly commend all the people in the outreach teams throughout the country, many of whom I have met. They have been magnificent through this pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> While Covid-19 has posed huge challenges, there have also been opportunities. My Department, local authorities, the Department of Health, the HSE and NGO service providers have worked together and existing relationships have been strengthened. The strong collaboration that has developed must continue and should yield longer-term benefits. For example, it is essential that health supports are provided in tandem with housing support, particularly for the most vulnerable homeless individuals who are on the streets or at risk of rough sleeping. I meet and speak to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, regularly and can say with a great deal of confidence that this is something on which we agree and are making progress. I also regularly meet my homelessness task force. The response to the Covid-19 pandemic is to the forefront of our thoughts and we regularly assess what is and is not working, what measures we must put in place and how we can improve. This will continue long after we have seen the back of this pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> On rental measures, tenants and landlords are experiencing economic difficulties as a result of the series of restrictions aimed at suppressing the spread of the virus.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">In order to mitigate those impacts on the rental sector, a number of legislative changes have been implemented to better protect tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> At the outset of the first lockdown, emergency measures provided that tenants could not be forced to leave their rental accommodation. Those emergency laws ceased to have effect on 1 August. Thereafter, I introduced the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 to protect tenants facing rent arrears and at risk of losing their tenancies. Subject to the eligible person making a declaration, this will provide protection and the earliest termination date allowed is 13 April 2021. In addition, for relevant tenancies, rent increases are prohibited until 13 April 2021, with no backdating allowed. Some members of the Opposition voted against these protections but, thankfully, they had a change of heart, which I welcome, and recently voted for their extension. In October, I introduced new legislation that automatically linked a 5 km travel restriction on public health grounds to an eviction moratorium. That legislation is in place now and runs up to at least 15 March. Again, there was some initial opposition to these measures but a more balanced response from Members opposite has occurred since and I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> Shortly after taking office in July, I announced a €40 million allocation to bring 2,500 vacant social homes back into use. This has been absolutely successful, with 2,565 social homes refurbished and allocated to people on the social housing list. This is very much focused on those who are experiencing homelessness in order to get them permanent homes. Overall last year, 3,607 social homes were brought back into use. The voids programme remains a very important tool in our armoury and is particularly relevant and important in light of the current shutdown in construction. I ask people to recognise where progress has been made, though others have sought to criticise.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> As part of the July stimulus response to Covid, the Government took a decision to expand the help-to-buy scheme, which has helped over 21,000 people buy and own their own permanent homes. Again, some Members opposite have opposed this €30,000 grant to first-time buyers but I and my colleagues in government firmly believe this is a good use of Exchequer funds, which can help people own their homes. That was implemented in the July stimulus.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> As regards local authority mortgages, in recognition of the financial pressures some borrowers are facing I have just this week put in place the fourth consecutive mortgage repayment break for local authority loan recipients. This is a further step to alleviate the burden on struggling households. Thankfully, just 3% of local authority mortgage holders have availed of this option but it is good that it is there.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> Planning remains open. We are working with the Attorney General and looking at measures that we may have to bring in to extend existing planning permissions due to the construction shutdown.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> These are extraordinary days of challenge but we can draw solace in some of the words passed down to us from generation to generation, containing a deep and abiding truth. Anois agus muid i ndorchadas an gheimhridh, tagann dhá sheanfhocal chugam: "Ar scáth a chéile a mhairimid" agus "Ní neart go cur le chéile". The wisdom of these Irish proverbs reminds us that we all exist in each other's shadow and that strength comes from unity. This should guide us in the months ahead as, slowly but surely, we turn the tide on this pandemic and look to brighter days ahead.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Peter Burke)<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_604">The essential role played by local authorities in our lives has never been more evident than during the Covid-19 crisis. They have provided real local leadership across the country and have helped communities to work together in these exceptional and difficult times. They have maintained virtually all of their services, even during lockdowns, and have played key roles in supporting local businesses and protecting vulnerable people in our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> Some €900 million was set aside by the Government in 2020 to provide for commercial rates waivers to a wide range of businesses. This was done in recognition of the fact that many ratepayers had to close their businesses or suffered significant reductions in turnover. This unprecedented measure provided support to businesses and certainty to our local authorities, enabling them to continue to deliver services across the country. Most of the waiver funding was paid to local authorities in December, with the balance being paid this month. To date, almost €730 million of commercial rates have been waived for almost 122,000 ratepayers, which is almost 85% of all ratepayers. The Government has recently announced a further rates waiver to be provided in the first quarter of 2021, for the businesses most seriously affected by ongoing restrictions. Some €160 million has been allocated to this end and details were issued to local authorities yesterday, 27 January.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> Income from services and local charges accounted for 26% of the local government sector's total budgeted income in 2020. That income is down by an estimated €71 million due to Covid-19's impact on areas such as parking charges, planning fees, and leisure or tourism-related activities. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has sanctioned the distribution of any unspent funds from the overall rates waiver allocation to the sector, in order to help minimise the impact of the reduction in these income streams and to meet other costs arising from Covid-19, such as for PPE.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> Local authorities have also played an instrumental role and a critical part in the roll-out of the restart and restart plus scheme. This grant scheme made €635 million available to help micro and small businesses with the costs of reopening and re-employing workers following Covid-19 closures. Local authorities processed over 108,000 applications and made subsequent payments to SMEs on behalf of the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> From the very beginning of this emergency, it was recognised that people who were cocooning or self-isolating would need extra help, particularly if their usual networks of support were not able to reach them at that time of strict public health measures. In response, the Community Call initiative was launched as a safety net for such people, many of whom were among the most vulnerable in our communities. The initiative brought together national government, local government and the community and voluntary sectors to ensure practical supports, like the collection and delivery of food, meals, fuel, medication, pensions and other essential items, would be in place at a local level. Each local authority established a Community Call forum to co-ordinate this locally. This brought together all those involved locally, including the HSE, An Garda Síochána, Civil Defence, an army of community and voluntary organisations, volunteers and councillors. I acknowledge the very significant amount of work that went into this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> I also pay tribute to the dedicated team in our Department and the HSE working with our Traveller community in this time of crisis. We spent almost €4 million on specific Covid measures for 2020. I met last week with the Irish Traveller Movement and am keeping in constant contact with that very vulnerable community. We have also established a programme board to implement the 31 recommendations of the expert report and we are working very closely with them to ensure they are kept safe during this very difficult time.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Malcolm Noonan)<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_610">While the formal transfer of heritage services to the Department was only finalised in September 2020, I am delighted to have the opportunity to reflect on how those services have responded to the challenges posed by Covid-19. The value and importance of our natural heritage has been appreciated as never before since March 2020. Our national parks and reserves protect a diversity of natural life and provide an invaluable resource which, I am proud to say, has remained open since the outset of the pandemic. I recognise and thank all the staff who have made it possible to keep appropriate parts of our network of State-owned land accessible to the public during this emergency. Our network of six iconic national parks and more than 80 nature reserves has given us both the physical and head space to absorb nature. They let us breathe and reflect. Visitor numbers have remained strong and I encourage the continued enjoyment of these wonderful outdoor resources. However, I also remind the public to adhere to all public health restrictions and advice, particularly the requirement not to travel more than 5 km from home.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> Regarding national monuments in State ownership, many sites are now closed and measures are in place at those that remain open to enable adherence to public health guidelines. My heritage division continues to liaise with OPW colleagues in order to protect the national estate during these times.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> Last year, over 450 heritage projects benefited from a sum of over €4.3 million under my Department’s built heritage capital grant schemes. The schemes provided some much-needed economic stimulus right around the country, and gave employment to the many small businesses, skilled conservation specialists and tradespeople involved in heritage-related construction activity. In November, I was delighted to announce a combined fund of €6 million for these schemes in 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> In my short time as Minister I have seen how dedicated our staff in the heritage area are. I have seen the value we place on heritage and I understand our commitments to the land and its history. This pandemic has not changed this; it has only made that commitment stronger. The public should seize the opportunity of international travel restrictions to explore our own island of Ireland this summer, once restrictions are eased and a mass-vaccination programme is under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I am sure that for many there is more of our country that has not been explored and so much more of our rich and diverse built natural and cultural heritage that can be explored, spending time and money in our local shops, restaurants, cafés and hotels. Despite the messages to "vax and go", people should consider holidaying in Ireland where our teams are waiting for them and will give them a warm welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> On voting in a time of Covid, we recently published the general scheme of the electoral reform Bill 2020 to help make elections safer if taking place during Covid-19 restrictions. The Bill provides for important electoral reforms, including the establishment of an electoral commission and the modernisation of our electoral registration processes. It also provides for the conducting of a poll over two days to facilitate social distancing and for a postal vote for those on the special voters list, should nursing homes and similar institutions be inaccessible. The Department is also in consultation with Returning Officers regarding practical Covid-compliant arrangements for the conducting of a poll. While there are no immediate electoral events on the horizon, it is important that we plan ahead and be prepared.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_616">I am sharing time with Deputy Gould. A year ago, during the general election campaign, the Fianna Fáil election manifesto promised the delivery of 50,000 affordable homes over the lifetime of the incoming Government. The Minister said on the election stump said that those homes would be available at prices of €250,000 or less for first-time buyers and others yet when we saw the final text of the programme for Government gone was that crucial commitment. Despite that, the Minister spent the first two weeks following his appointment promising to deliver affordable homes at prices between €160,000 and €250,000. Astonishingly, just like the disappearance of affordable homes from the programme for Government so, too, had that commitment disappeared from the budget. There was no increase in the serviced sites fund on the moneys already committed by Fine Gael, despite that it is the crucial mechanism for delivering affordable homes through local authorities. A measly €35 million is provided for 400 affordable cost-rental homes this year which, while welcome, are nowhere close to the thousands of affordable cost rental homes recommended to Government by the Housing Agency, ESRI, and the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> What we did get is a return of Fianna Fáil and the bad old days of the Celtic tiger in the form of an increase to the help-to-buy scheme. This has not only been criticised by the Opposition. NESC and the ESRI have said it will push up demand at a time of limited supply and, in turn, push up prices. Worse than that, we had the introduction of a toxic shared equity loan scheme. Again, it is not just the Opposition who are critical of this scheme. The most senior official in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in emails to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, said that this will increase house prices and, at least, it will lock in the unsustainable level of house prices currently if not push them up further. What is really interesting is that this scheme was not in the Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael manifestos. This scheme was written and designed by two property industry lobby groups at the start of 2020, which I know because they also met all of the housing spokespeople at that time, me included. It is based on a controversial and well-criticised scheme in the United Kingdom. It will also lock in and push up unsustainably high prices while loading working families with ever greater levels of debt. Not satisfied with this, the Minister seems intent on bringing the banks into the shared equity loan scheme. He is currently in negotiations through the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland to double the €75 million of State money with €75 million of banking money. I understand there is a dispute between Government and federation regarding interest payments. No matter the level of interest, all this will do is saddle hard-working people with ever greater and, at the outset, unquantifiable levels of debt and all the while the banks will profit. This is no way to address our housing crisis. </p>
          <p eId="para_618"> All the while, because of the failures of Fine Gael and, now, Fianna Fáil housing policy, house prices and rents continue to spiral out of control. The report of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, published this week makes for grim reading for those wanting to rent or buy at affordable prices. The cheapest suburban apartment currently under construction is €359,000. The cheapest city centre apartment in Dublin is €439,000. Who can buy these apartments? Not ordinary working people or even working people on good incomes. More than 70% of these properties are being built by build-to-rent developers. If that is not bad enough, the rents are sky high, ranging from €1,850 per month, which is the cheapest in the suburbs, to €2,600 per month in the city centre. Does anybody think hard-working, single people, let alone couples, can afford those types of rents and still have a decent standard of living?</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> The SCSI report shows that Fine Gael's housing policy has failed. This is the consequence of a decade of Fine Gael politicians and Ministers not taking housing affordability seriously. It has failed to deliver affordable homes to working people. In 2018, the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, introduced the serviced sites fund and from the Opposition benches, the current Minister claimed credit for that €300 million. The then Government promised to deliver 6,200 affordable homes by 2021. Not one of those houses has been delivered and only 150 are currently in construction and we do not know when they will be ready or what the final price will be. The Fianna Fáil response within six months in government is to throw even more fuel on the flames of house purchase and rent inflation and to continue to underinvest in genuine affordable homes to rent or buy. It is not increasing the targets for social housing as outlined by Fine Gael in the national development plan or investing in local authority-led affordable homes to rent or buy. </p>
          <p eId="para_620"> As we all know, there is an alternative. Not only the Opposition but an increasing range of voices in industry, the NGO sector and the academy are saying that in light of negative interest rates for Government borrowing now is the time to invest directly in local authority and AHB-led affordable homes, which working people can buy without hidden equity charges or spiralling costs to buy or rent. The scale of capital investment that would be required would be double what was agreed in the budget a few short months ago. We need in the region of €3 billion to deliver at least 20,000 social and affordable homes each year. The Minister when campaigning during the general election promised that Fianna Fáil would deliver 50,000 social homes and 50,000 affordable homes. Now that he is in office, when Sinn Féin proposes that, he says it is not achievable, there are no planning permissions and no delivery mechanism. If he thinks that now, why during the election did he promise the very same targets being proposed now by Sinn Féin? Perhaps as Pat Rabbitte famously said, "That's just the kind of thing you do to win elections." </p>
          <p eId="para_621"> In the remaining three minutes available to me before I hand over to my colleague Deputy Gould, I would like to put some simple questions to the Minister. He is developing a reputation for bluff and bluster. Perhaps in this short exchange, he will give some direct and simple answers to direct and simple questions. First, how many affordable homes to rent and buy will be delivered by Government this year? I am seeking only a number, not a speech. </p>

In the coming couple of weeks, if not in the next week, we will be announcing the specific areas where the homes will be delivered. We have put out the call on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_670">The latest managers' report from Cork City Council states that there are 8,913 individuals and families on the housing list in Cork city alone. That does not include all the people on the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme or the rental accommodation scheme, RAS. On average, 1,054 new applications are received in Cork annually. Cork City Council built approximately 600 houses in 2020. Before the Minister mentions the issues arising because of the Covid crisis, I will point out that it built 654 the previous year.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> I want to note that Cork City Council is recognised as one of the best local authorities for delivering social housing. It meets all the Government targets that are set out every year. My issue is that the Government targets are not good enough and they are not high enough. To put it simply, the Government's targets are too low. It knows it and the Department knows it. The targets that are being set will never solve the housing crisis. It is as simple as this: if there are 9,000 people and families on the housing list, 1,000 new applications coming in every year and 600 houses being built, the housing crisis will never be resolved. Surely the Minister and the people in his Department know this. The bare minimum that is needed if they are going to tackle the crisis is to build the number of houses that matches the number of people coming onto the list every year, plus extra.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> The Minister is not providing enough funding for Cork City Council and other local authorities to build the social housing that is needed to tackle the crisis. I have given the figures. The Department gets those figures every month from Cork City Council. For him to come in here telling us about all the great work that is being done is not acceptable. That is one of the other major issues. Successive Ministers with responsibility for housing have come into the Dáil with new plans and told Deputies how the housing crisis will be solved. People ring me in my office and say that they hope I can get one of the houses for them. However, those houses are not being delivered at all because the list keeps going up and up. It is estimated that in four years' time, Cork City Council's housing waiting list will include more than 12,000 individuals and families. At this time, there are 911 families and individuals on the waiting list for more than 12 years. It is a scandal. I have listened to the Minister talk about what he is hoping to do. This is what is happening now and this is what people are living with.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> There is much more I could say but I will raise just one more point. I attended a meeting yesterday about the development by the Land Development Agency, LDA, on the St. Kevin's Hospital site in Cork, which involves the building of 266 units. Twenty-seven apartments, or 10% of the total, are being provided for social housing. This means that 90% of the units under the plan as it is now - the closing date for submissions is tomorrow - will be put out to the public for private purchase. How can the Minister stand over that? Will he put in a submission tomorrow to An Bord Pleanála to seek the provision of more than 10% social housing? Will he also look to extend the date for submissions in respect of this project? The people in the community do not know about it. There has been no engagement with residents and community groups. There is no transport infrastructure and no roads infrastructure in place. The LDA wants to rush the project ahead. Will the Minister request that the closing date be extended for four weeks to allow people time to make submissions? Will he put in a submission seeking more than 10% social housing?</p>

        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" eId="spk_366">
          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_675">As the Minister knows, we are in the middle of a housing crisis and a homelessness crisis. We have a social housing crisis, a rent affordability crisis and an unaffordable house price crisis. The cause of these crises is an outdated, right-wing, ideological approach to planning and development which has led to a chronic underinvestment in public housing for the past 20 years and a housing market that is fundamentally broken. I represent the constituency of Dublin Bay North, which the Minister knows well. The hardest part of my job - the hardest part of the job for any of us in this House - is the hundreds of representations I receive every year from people in desperate need of adequate housing. There are more than 29,000 people on waiting lists in the greater Dublin area. In Dublin Bay North, there are 8,320 people on the Dublin City Council area B housing waiting list. Between January and September 2020, there were 196 allocations in area B, including transfers. At that rate, it would take 42 years to clear the list. People are suffering from the constant stress and fear of rent hikes or evictions. Some are living in overcrowded accommodation, with several generations of a family living in one house. There are some in severe medical need.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> There are three practical things I would ask the Minister to do to address this social housing and greater housing need in Dublin Bay North. First, I ask him to work with my colleague, Councillor Alison Gilliland, and the cross-party working group in Dublin City Council, which is coming up with a new plan to deliver housing on the Oscar Traynor Road site. Second, I ask that the Department would pay for the community infrastructure required to support developments and that it separate those costs from the housing costs. The stand-off in this debate a few minutes ago calls to mind the attempts by Sinn Féin Deputies to pretend that they are hugely ideologically opposed to what the Government is doing. I would say to those who consistently vote down proposals for local property tax increases in the local authorities that this funding could go towards housing need, housing infrastructure and community infrastructure. It could go towards homeless services and sheltered housing. I do not see how anybody from Sinn Féin could side with Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil in local authorities to vote an extra €375 into the hands of somebody who owns a €1 million property. Let us have less of the grandstanding and populism and more of a realisation that this sort of vote, whipped by Sinn Féin, cost Dublin City Council €12 million that could have been gratefully received and used for the types of projects we are discussing.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> Third, we need the Minister to finance Dublin City Council to allow it to accelerate its apartment regeneration projects across the city. This would improve not just the quality but the quantity of units. I know plans are advancing for Cromcastle Court in Kilmore and St. Anne's Court in Raheny, but there are many other opportunities. The current plan would take 15 years but, with a bit of ambition, there is no reason that we could not get it down to maybe half that.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Given the low cost of capital and the exorbitant rates being paid for the housing assistance payment in areas of Dublin 17 in my constituency, investment in public housing in Dublin Bay North will actually save the public purse money over the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> As well as the crisis in social housing, we have a crisis in homelessness, unaffordable rents and house prices all caused by a broken housing market. The Minister and I have spoken before about the potential for a rent-to-buy scheme. I know the Minister has shown interest in it and I believe it is one of the schemes we should recover and invest in again. The reason for the broken market is that we have a system and a Department, as far as I can see, that has been almost completely ideologically captured by the private sector mindset. No finer example of this can be found than in the strategic housing development, SHD, process. It is an anti-democratic process that has utterly failed to deliver units. Instead, it has had a less-than 30% success rate in five years. It has been publicly stated that the SHD legislation was delivered almost line by line by the Property Industry Ireland lobby group to the Department and the Minister's Fine Gael predecessor, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> Now, we find ourselves with unaffordable half-empty high-rise buildings and unsustainable co-living applications that are entirely aimed at maximising the value of a single site instead of delivering sustainable and affordable housing across Dublin. The brutal truth has been highlighted in recent days by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland report, which shows that high-rise buildings are more expensive. This exposes the lie that height is a panacea to our problems. We have to stop allowing developers to use the housing crisis as an excuse to ride roughshod over all the principles of sustainable and affordable housing, including the principle of having a planning process with proper scrutiny of planning applications and a development plan voted in by elected councillors who understand the dynamic of the local authority area. There are big questions that we need to address to do this, like the right to housing, implementation of the Kenny report and proper taxation of speculative development land. I call on the Minister to break the influence of the developers and hedge funds on the Department and to get rid of SHDs. The Minister has committed to doing this, in fairness to him. We need to reinstate the eviction ban, implement a proper rent freeze and ensure that the same groups which caused the last crash are not allowed to exploit this housing crisis for their own ends.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> I appreciate I have not given the Minister much time for a response but if he wishes to correspond with me I would appreciate it, especially about the constructive suggestions that myself and my colleague, Senator Moynihan, have given to the Minister and the Department recently.</p>

          <p eId="para_686">Deputy Ó Ríordáin asked about the Oscar Traynor development. We are working with the council and with colleagues of Deputy Ó Ríordáin in the Labour Party on revised proposals there, especially around the contribution potentially from the Department.

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_690">I understand the time allocation is four and a half minutes, four minutes and three minutes, in that order.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> I thank the Minister for his speech and for outlining the challenges we face. I believe the Land Development Agency is a potential game changer in addressing housing supply. The report yesterday from the surveyors shows that we will not have compact development in our city if we rely solely on the market because of the cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> I fear we will not have regional dispersion, involving the growth of Waterford, Cork and other cities if we do not have an active Land Development Agency. My point to the Minister is that our plans must be ambitious. The agency must be equipped with sufficient powers to carry out the acquisition of lands and assembly of sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> I fear that the system will be too conservative in the Land Development Agency. It is important that we have a State developer that challenges private developers and hoarding and some of the features that have developed in that market. It is also essential that the Land Development Agency develops master plans for all our housing needs, not only the needs of those on public housing lists but those of everyone who is looking for affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> I support the affordable housing Bill, the heads of which the Minister has published in recent days. It is true to point out that many of the people who the Bill will help are paying up to €20,000 in rent per year for one-bedroom apartments. The scheme will allow these people access at three quarters of the cost in terms of their monthly payments to a far larger dwelling suitable for their long-term needs. It is to be commended.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> It is of course true that if one lets people into the market who have been blocked out, one adds to demand. The key to ensuring that this does not create pressure in prices is supply. That is where we come back to the crucial ambitions of the Land Development Agency. The agency must be equipped to drive on that supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> I wish to point out the many useful recommendations from the National Economic and Social Council in that area, including aggressive use of Part V provisions, more aggressive use of the various funds that the Minister knows about and use of infrastructural funds and serviced sites funds and so on. There are new dimensions in public procurement that can be more innovative and drive down costs, as well as new dimensions in zoning. All these measures should be put in place. There are schemes, like the repair and refurbish scheme, where we have seen low levels of take-up in most local authorities. Some 19 authorities have not bothered at all. Yet 45% of applications have come from one council, namely, Waterford City and County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> I strenuously oppose the narrow ideology that has sunk the 853 homes in Santry. The development was going to offer balanced supply, with 256 social, 170 affordable, 213 cost-rental and 213 private dwellings. This was badly needed on a site that has lain derelict for 40 years. There was four years of planning, which was approved by Sinn Féin at the time it was initiated. It was then sunk at the last minute by the vote of the council. This is the sort of innovative procurement from local authorities that we need to see. It will drive down the cost of producing public housing. There is more than a hint of hypocrisy in the way it has been dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> The mantra of "only public housing on public land" must be called out for what it is. It will block the potential of the Land Development Agency to really change the way in which our housing market works. The agency has an obligation to provide homes for all our community. We must not see a return to segregated housing for one type of tenant only.</p>

          <p eId="para_699">I will be brief because I am conscious that I am sharing my last three minutes with Deputy Duffy. I will make three or four brief points and leave the remainder of my time for the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> We need to welcome the homelessness figures released recently. Obviously, it is not enough and there are still far too many families and individuals in homeless and emergency accommodation. Yet, since the Minister has taken office there has been a reduction of almost 2,000 in homelessness figures, which is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> I commend the Minister on his voids programme, which delivered almost 600 houses in Cork city and county in 2020. My first question is whether the Minister envisages that the scheme will be rolled out again in 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> My next question relates to wind energy guidelines. In County Cork, there are several planning applications at present for wind turbines. I seek clarity and an update on the guidelines. The draft guidelines were published in 2017 and we are still waiting for the publication of the final guidelines. Does the Minister have an update on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> As Deputy Bruton mentioned development and we are currently going through our development plan review in Cork county and city. I agree with the Members from the Opposition on one thing, which is that we need to be ambitious in these development plans. During my time on Cork County Council, we often spoke about active land management and how it needs to be incorporated into the strategy. We need to set ambitious targets and in my experience we often see how land might be zoned for a lengthy period, often several decades, before it comes to the point of development.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">I ask that the Minister consider talking to the local authorities and implementing that active land management strategy effectively. If people are sitting and hoarding land or waiting for it to appreciate, we need to entertain the prospect of possibly dezoning that land, looking elsewhere and zoning land that is available for development. It might not be popular to say, but it would be far more proactive and beneficial in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Finally, the Minister is undertaking a review of the HAP scheme. Is there any update on that or any intention to undertake that review? In addition, does he have any information on any new tenant purchase scheme?</p>

We have allocations for this year, and with the construction shutdown, we may put more into that. The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, will answer on wind energy guidelines.

          <p eId="para_709">I thank the Minister for taking my two questions. This pandemic has made us fully realise the importance of a safe and secure home. The referendum on a right to housing will enshrine this in our law. When will the Minister deliver on this commitment? What role will the commission on housing have? Can he ensure that organisations such as Home for Good, which have worked resolutely on this, will be engaged to deliver on this commitment?</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> Last year, an estimated 18,800 homes were delivered, though currently our housing demand requires in excess of 30,000 homes each year for the foreseeable future, as projected by the ESRI. Considering the impact Covid-19 has had on the construction sector and, therefore, housing delivery, what are the 2022 projected targets, and will the Minister give a breakdown of the social, cost-rental and affordable housing units?</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> Those are my two questions: the timeline for the right to housing referendum and the projected figures for 2022 and the breakdown of same.</p>

          <p eId="para_714">There is a commitment in the programme for Government, as the Deputy rightly stated, to a referendum on the right to housing. I see the commission on housing, which we ourselves negotiated during talks on the programme for Government, playing a central role in that. I spoke at a virtual conference just last week about outlining our plans to establish the commission that would look at certain issues, including a legislative right to housing. Mercy Law Resource Centre and others have done incredible work on this but looking at other jurisdictions. I expect that work is under way - we have some work on it - to establish the commission. I would like it established this year. There will be certain segments within the commission to deal with legislation, homelessness, housing delivery, costs and other elements. The Department is working on that. I did a great deal of work on it over the summer. I do not expect a referendum this year, to be frank. We have to work on a proposal that would be put to the people. We have to look at how that would be framed. We will seek submissions from all groups, such as those the Deputy has mentioned, that have been heavily involved in this, many of which I have met, at the correct and appropriate time to feed into that. It would be important for this country and it is an important commitment in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> Housing delivery was affected last year. We are concluding the figures for housing completions last year. Deputy Duffy has a figure of 18,800. It might be slightly more. This year's target for public housing is 12,750. That will be impacted by the nine-week shutdown so far as a result of Covid. I earnestly hope we will get the sector back up and running fully on 5 March. It is my desire to do so. We have to see what the effects will be this year to be able to project into next year. As for affordable homes, there were 400 cost-rental this year, which is not insignificant. Others may dismiss that. Cost-rental is a new tenure of housing that is incredibly important and we will start it off and build on it incrementally. We will not make outlandish promises on housing delivery. We need to readjust on 5 March, when the sector gets back open, and look at our targets for this year for affordable homes. We will have a fund of €110 million to deliver affordable homes for this year and over the next 12 months. It is too early to talk about 2022. We need to try to get 2021 dealt with. What we are targeting, though, and based on the research we have sought and that we will publish, including from the ESRI, is that the State needs 30,000 homes, both public and private, per year in the short to medium term. We are well off that at the moment, with the pandemic having an impact, obviously.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_716">I wish to ask the Minister about the shared equity scheme. He frequently cites the British shared equity loan scheme, and I assume that his proposed scheme is similar to that introduced by the Tories. First, I am surprised that the Minister for Finance has given the green light to the scheme because it is a demand-side response to what is a supply-side problem, and that is patently obvious to anybody. As an economic policy, it is completely wrong-headed.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> Second, the scheme, if rolled out, could have an immediate impact on the share prices of developers in this State. A study by Geoff Meeks of Cambridge University found that in the three years before the shared equity scheme was rolled out in Britain the share price of leading developers increased in line with share prices of the FTSE 350 but that in the four years after the shared equity scheme was introduced, share prices on the FTSE 350 rose by 47% while the share prices of leading developers rose by 230%. Shareholders, managers and CEOs, therefore, prospered under the shared equity scheme in Britain, and the impact here is likely to be no different. The Minister has already heard from the most senior civil servant in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that his proposal is about lining the pockets of developers, but sure are those not the spots Fianna Fáil has always worn?</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> My immediate concern is about the impact this scheme will have on the borrowers and on the market. In 2019, the British National Audit Office published a progress report on the scheme. It found that 63% of buyers could have bought a property without the scheme. Under the Minister's intended scheme, it is understood that the taxpayer would take a 30% equity stake in all new builds purchased. To be clear, this is the taxpayer investing in the property market. As Gareth Davies, head of the British National Audit Office, commented, "The scheme has ... exposed the government [and the taxpayer] to significant ... risk if property values fall." The risks extend to borrowers. The same progress report found that buyers who want to sell their property soon after they purchase it might find they are in negative equity. This concern was raised also in February 2020 by the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, the British equivalent of the Central Bank. The FCA warned that borrowers who had availed of the shared equity loan scheme were more likely to face negative equity if property prices fell.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> My understanding, which the Minister can clarify, is that under his proposed scheme, first-time buyers will require a deposit of 10% of the value of the property, that a special purpose vehicle, SPV, will be established taking 30% equity for the State and that the buyer will then take the mortgage worth 60% of the value of the property. From year six the property will involve interest-only payments on the equity, with the equity to be paid on the sale of the property or at the end of the mortgage term. This could mean buyers taking out an overall debt equivalent of more than five times their income, circumventing the Central Bank's mortgage measures and loan-to-income limits. These measures were put in place to protect borrowers and to avoid what the Central Bank describes as a credit-house price spiral. By circumventing these rules, the scheme risks such a spiral.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> I hope the Minister will be able to clarify some of the matters before us. Perhaps he will also respond to what Robert Watt has claimed, that is, that the Minister's scheme is about filling or lining the pockets of developers. First, is he setting up an SPV with any retail banks to manage this equity scheme? Second, what rate of interest will be charged on this equity? Will it vary annually and, if so, how? Third, can he guarantee that the taxpayer will fully recoup the equity invested? Fourth, will a first-time buyer under the scheme be able to take out combined loans worth more than five times his or her salary?</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Fifth, will the Department be able to tell a first-time buyer who uses the scheme the full cost of his or her repayments for the full term?</p>

          <p eId="para_723">That is okay. I thank the Ceann Comhairle. The scheme is still being worked through. We are bringing forward several affordability measures. Approximately €468 million was allocated in budget 2021 in this regard, covering the serviced sites fund, the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, the help-to-buy scheme, the shared equity scheme and the affordable rental scheme. We will publish the shared equity scheme. The Bill has been published. We will move forward with regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> I have been bemused by Sinn Féin Deputies trying to shoot down the scheme before they have even seen it. Perhaps they should look at equivalent or comparable schemes. My Department and I have looked at such schemes in other jurisdictions. The help-to-buy scheme in England increased housing supply by 14% and house price inflation has increased by less than 1%.

          <p eId="para_737">I have two sets of questions and I would be grateful if the Minister were to let me back in halfway through my time to ask the second round of questions. I will not interrupt him while he is responding. On 7 December, the Minister, speaking on the "Morning Ireland" radio programme, categorically denied that anyone was being turned away from emergency accommodation. Four days later, "RTÉ Investigates" filmed this cruel and inhumane practice taking place when Joe Nolan, a Carlow man, was refused access to emergency accommodation and had to sleep rough in a car park, as he had been doing for quite some time. That happened on a night 75 emergency beds were lying empty. Since the "RTÉ Investigates" programme aired last week, this practice has continued on an ongoing basis. In addition, people who have fled domestic violence have also been refused access to shelter based on these rules. Keeping it under review is simply not good enough. It is not good enough for people who were sleeping rough last night or for those who will do so tonight. Does the Minister acknowledge that, in spite of what he has said, the practice of turning people away from emergency accommodation is continuing? Will he issue to local authorities and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, explicit instructions leaving no room for discretion that they are to stop turning people away? Will he now act to end this cruel and inhumane practice?</p>

          <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_738">I respect the Deputy and the fact that all Deputies wish to play their part in helping those who are homeless and getting them into emergency accommodation when they need it, but some of the charges he has made do a disservice to those who are working in the sector here in Dublin. Let us be straight about this. I gave very clear direction on 7 December and again on 9 December in writing. The Deputy is aware of that. It was not about discretion; it was very clear. I have met the DRHE since the "RTÉ Investigates" programme, in which I participated, aired. The two gentlemen in question should not have been refused emergency accommodation. I stated that very clearly. There are other elements in each of those instances, which I cannot go into here, that occurred that evening. We have been very clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> There is emergency bed capacity in all major cities. That is the case because we are funding it. In Dublin, 300 additional beds have been put in place. I am in daily contact with outreach teams as well. It might be worthwhile for the Deputy to seek a briefing from the DRHE. I can arrange that and I think he would find it useful because there are complexities around rough sleepers and getting people into emergency accommodation from time to time. People cannot, and should not, be forced into emergency accommodation. What I can tell the Deputy is that those on outreach teams have already recognised the changes we made around the requirement for a local connection. I am not ambiguous about this; I am very clear. The local connection requirement is not a barrier to people accessing emergency accommodation. That has changed. If any instances that have occurred since that change are brought to my attention, I and my Department will deal with them. It is a positive change.</p>

          <p eId="para_740">Let me be clear that we are not talking about anyone being forced into emergency accommodation; we are talking about people who are asking for access to emergency accommodation and are continuing to be refused.

          <p eId="para_741">I am trying to be helpful because this is a very serious issue. I am engaging on it every day. If there are any instances, the Deputy needs to bring them to my attention.

If he has not, I urge him to do so in order that we can deal with it. At the end of the day, we are dealing with people. If a process falls down, we need to fix it. There is not a push for this not to happen. The local connection requirement is not a barrier to people accessing emergency accommodation. As far as I am concerned, it is not occurring any more but if it is, I ask the Deputy to please let me know of such instances and I will deal with them.</p>

The responsibility is mine as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but if the Deputy, as spokesperson on housing for an Opposition party, is aware of a specific instance where an individual has been refused emergency accommodation since I brought in the changes, he should pick up the phone to call me.

          <p eId="para_749">I have certain points to put to the Minister and I ask him to reply within the four minutes I have in order that my colleagues can make their contributions. I wish to again bring to his attention the issue of rural villages without sewers. I know he has been very engaged on this issue as Minister. There are several such villages in County Clare. It is a real inhibitor of rural life. It is a standout issue in the village of Broadford, which is in my neck of the woods, just a few miles from my house. The village cannot grow. It has the same infrastructure it had in the 19th century. In some places, when one flushes a toilet, it goes out into a gravel soak pit out the back. There are no sewers or even septic tanks for some homes. It is archaic infrastructure. I know the Department is looking at ways of addressing the issue. I would like to hear more in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> I grew up in Ballycannon, Meelick. A housing estate was built in the village in the 1970s.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">The residents were told that the sewerage infrastructure was temporary and that they would be connected to the mains in a matter of years but nothing happened in the decades that followed. We now have some positive news, that is, Irish Water has told us that it is undertaking design works this spring to decommission the existing infrastructure and connect those houses to the main Limerick drainage system but that construction might not be complete until the second quarter of 2023. They cannot wait that long. The smells are a knock-out. It is nauseating; you would be sick if you went there. I am asking the Minister to look at advancing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> I also wish to bring the construction sector to the attention of the Minister. We are at the height of level 5 restrictions, dealing with peak Covid-19 and an emergency in our country but we have seen the construction of local authority housing continue, which was a good decision on the Minister's behalf. There are people around the countryside asking about houses that are semi-complete. I get the points that the Minister has been making quite vociferously in the media about this but can we get any further clarity on the issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_753">I will deal with the Deputy's last question first because it is very important. I want the construction sector to fully reopen on 5 March. The reason the construction sector is closed has nothing to do with its operation. Companies in the sector have operated safely, been agile and shown an ability to take on new work practices to keep workers safe and to deliver. The sector is closed simply to reduce the movement of people and I hope it will be fully open again on 5 March. That is my earnest wish. There are some small exemptions to the restrictions around social housing and emergency works, and rightly so. We are working through those regulations and they will be published later this evening. I have engaged extensively with the sector because people's jobs and livelihoods are at stake and the provision of homes for people is, and remains, an essential service.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> I will come back to the Deputy directly on the other couple of issues he raised. I met with the Deputy and constituency colleagues about the issues he raised about Broadford. We are working on the preparation of a pilot scheme for rural villages and towns that do not have the requisite Irish Water infrastructure, or indeed any sewage infrastructure. Work has advanced following the meeting I had with Oireachtas Members before Christmas. I will come back to the Deputy on the other two matters he raised.</p>

          <p eId="para_755">I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on this important subject. The Ceann Comhairle knows that there is a serious housing problem in our county that is not going away. We all have to combine to do something about it. It affects young people and families. There must be 100,000 young families all over the country who have been directly affected and cannot house themselves. A recent report showed that a two-person family on average incomes needs €96,000 in order to qualify for a house, never mind to buy a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> Covid-19 is affecting this matter and it is deeply upsetting that the pandemic came at this particular time but nobody has any control over that. A number of us were members of a special housing advisory group four and a half years ago. I made some submissions to that group with which not everybody agreed, although that is not unusual. The fact of the matter is that drastic measures are required to deal with the housing issue. I am happy to do everything that I can by way of co-operation and will help the Minister to work out something that will bring results. We need to do that as a matter of urgency. I hope that we can bring Covid under control and, once we have, the next issue that has to be dealt with as a matter of national emergency is the housing issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> House prices are far beyond what is affordable. Twelve years ago, I set out to prove that. With the acquisition of private sites from the local authority, we organised the building of 96 houses in two towns. When the houses were built, they came in at 50% less in cost than the affordable houses that were available through the local authorities at the same time. I felt at that time that house prices and costs were too high and so on. I believe it is within our ability to resolve that matter. I am not looking for a reply from the Minister.

          <p eId="para_758">I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for their presentations. We heard a Sinn Féin Deputy talk about the spots that Fianna Fáil always wore. Their frustration is born out of the fact that we are now in government and building houses. That is where their frustration is coming from. Sinn Féin cannot bear to see all the housing projects that have started in the past six to eight months. That is where that frustration comes from. I am proud to be a Fianna Fáil Deputy because we are addressing the housing crisis that has beset this country for a long number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> I want to talk about a family firm that is a key cornerstone in getting houses built. Two brothers and a mother run a company that employs 50 people. They had just started a housing project in Louth including 94 social houses but, unfortunately, the building work had to stop with the Covid restrictions that have been imposed. They invested heavily in different forms of machinery and materials to get this project off the ground. They have commitments with their banks and lease companies. They are being told that if they do not honour their commitments, the banks will give them a moratorium but it will affect their credit rating. For two young men who have recently set up a very efficient firm, that is just not on. This cash flow problem is completely outside their control. As the Minister said, hopefully they will be able to restart construction on 5 March, get back to work and their cash flow will get back on stream. As it stands, both the banks and the leasing companies they are dealing with are not treating them fairly. This is not an isolated incident; it is happening to many other construction companies around the country. Others might scoff at developers but these are the people who will build the houses and we need them to do that. We worried about the availability of tradesmen and everything else when we were trying to get our housing projects up and running. It is absolutely essential that the companies that are going to build these houses for us are kept in business and treated fairly by our banks and financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> I support Deputy Cathal Crowe's comments on the infrastructure in rural counties such as my own, Tipperary, and Clare. An awful lot of our small towns and villages do not have any waste treatment infrastructure and that is hindering development. We see plans about clusters of houses being built in these villages but the infrastructure to do it is just not there. That needs to be addressed immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> The national framework plan focuses on houses being built in clusters in towns with a bar on building houses in rural areas. That needs to be looked at. To say that family members cannot build houses where they were born and raised will not be acceptable to rural villages and will decimate local communities, whether that is the schools in local areas or the hurling or football teams. If we do not have the ability to build house in rural areas, it will have a hugely detrimental effect going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> People are off work for prolonged periods and in mortgage arrears due to Covid restrictions. A moratorium that does not affect credit ratings must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> There are houses being built where construction has had to stop due to Covid. Some of those houses are at a stage where the weather will have a serious impact on them. A builder who is building four houses at the moment was on to me this morning. He visited the site this morning and dampness is having a serious impact on those houses. Could they be allowed to do remedial work on those houses to bring them to a point where the weather will not continue to damage them?</p>

          <p eId="para_764">I will bring in the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, on the rural planning guidelines. The Deputy mentioned an instance of damp and in that case, or if a site needs to be secured during the lockdown, those works could take place on an emergency basis. We ask people to use a commonsensical approach to that, as I am sure they will. That would apply in the instance the Deputy mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> The Deputy also mentioned funding and the SME sector that is going to be crucial in delivering the housing stock that we need. Coincidentally, I engaged this morning about a couple of issues around banks and finance firms that apply to equipment. We will be working on that, particularly for the five weeks of the lockdown, and that should not affect any firm's credit rating, particularly on the SME side.</p>

          <p eId="para_766">The Department is currently embarking on a review of sustainable rural housing. The previous one was carried out in 2005. When one looks at the annual report of the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, in the majority of counties the approval rating for planning permission for one-off houses is almost 90%. We carried out an analysis of County Limerick, where there were significant complaints, and it transpired that only 8% of planning applications for rural areas were withdrawn and 85% were approved. We will carry out a review to codify it. The national planning framework, NPF, is facilitating the need when social and economic aspects are demonstrated.</p>

          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_767">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on housing, which unfortunately is a topic I deal with in my constituency offices on a daily basis. The Minister has responsibility for housing in the State but, like me, he is also a representative of the people of north County Dublin. As he is aware, we represent the fastest growing constituency in the country, one that has also has one of the youngest populations in Europe. Many of the people we represent are renting or looking to buy their own homes but the housing market across Swords, Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Donabate and right across north County Dublin is broken. The daft.ie house price report for the fourth quarter of 2020 showed that house prices in Fingal increased by 7.8%. In normal times that would be bad enough, but during the pandemic this is utter madness. Many people across north County Dublin have lost their jobs or have seen their wages cut. We know that from the workers in Aer Lingus, who have had their wages cut by 70%. Others have lost their jobs completely, their income is gone or they are on the PUP or EWSS. Nobody in Fingal saw their wages increase by 7.8%, so how can they be expected to afford a house when prices are increasing at this rate?</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> When an Teachta O'Brien was appointed Minister in the summer he said he wanted affordable homes delivered at a cost of between €160,000 and €250,000. Where are these homes in Balbriggan or anywhere across north County Dublin? Where are they in Swords or any of the areas we represent? I receive a stream of emails, calls and letters each week from young people in the constituency who are desperate to have the security of knowing when they close the door in the evening that they do not have to share their accommodation with someone else, that they are not confined to their mother's back bedroom and that they have their own home. It should not be beyond their reach. What we have instead is crippling high rents and the chance of home ownership gets further away from them every single day.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> The same goes for the building of council houses. We must invest now in the constituency to make up for a lack of building in previous decades so that we can tackle the housing waiting list, which is currently 8,000. We must get people out of the rental trap, off HAP, and out of emergency accommodation and into decent accommodation that they own. There are so many people, especially young people, caught in a rental trap who do not qualify for social housing. They cannot even dream of owning their own home. The Minister quoted a seanfhocal in his contribution. I have another one for him. Níl aon tinteán mar do thinteán féin. It should not be beyond the aspiration of the young people that he and I are charged with representing that they would own their own home. From what they tell me, they are desperate. They have lost hope. They do not believe that this is going to happen. They have no evidence to support that, despite the claims from the Minister's colleagues about all of the houses the Government is building. There does not seem to be much of that in our constituency. People are frustrated and hurt. What hope is there for them if the house prices are rising by 10% and their wages are not going up? What hope do they have of ever owning their own home?</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> The shared equity scheme the Minister has talked about is only going to deliver higher house prices. It is not going to bring home ownership closer for these people. We only have to quote from the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who said that the property industry wants an equity scheme because it will increase prices. The Minister is continuing with the failed polices of the previous Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and Fine Gael. The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is better than that. He must be ambitious, not just for our constituency but for the State. He cannot simply continue the failed housing policies of the previous Government. We know how serious the situation is. The Minister must hear it as well as I do on the ground in our constituency. The people whom we represent want to see him succeed as Minister, but they have very little hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> I have two questions for the Minister in the short time remaining. The answers are just numbers, so they will be very quick. How many affordable homes costing, as the Minister outlined, between €160,000 and €250,000 will be delivered in Fingal by the end of the year and how many social homes will be built by the end of this year by the Government?</p>

          <p eId="para_785">If we had a little bit longer for the small groups, we might have time.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> A modern day plague or infestation has struck most of Dublin and perhaps other parts of the country. The infestation is particularly acute in south Dublin. It is not locusts but property developers and property speculators, who are drawn like bees around a honey pot or perhaps flies around a less pleasant substance, but the attraction point is strategic housing developments, SHDs. They are really just a mechanism to print money for speculators and property developers, facilitated by Government policy. The extent of the infestation is extraordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> Deputy Bríd Smith referred earlier to the Player Wills, Bailey Gibson and St. Teresa's Gardens sites, where there is talk of 19 storeys, mostly for developments of one-bed or two-bed units of build-to-rent units with rents of between €1,350 and €2,800. They are completely inappropriate, unaffordable and driven by profit. There is nothing strategic at all about it. In my area, on the Dalguise House site in Monkstown it is proposed to build 300 units up to nine storeys, in Abingdon in Shankill it is proposed to build 193 units up to eight storeys and a proposed development on the car park of St. Michael's Hospital in Dún Laoghaire is for 13 storeys. All those sites are build-to-rent developments. In Deansgrange there is a proposed development of 151 units over six storeys; on the Europa site, it is 101 units over nine storeys; and on the site in Eblana Avenue, it is proposed to build 208 co-living units over six storeys. The Charleville site in Dalkey is for 105 apartments over six storeys and there is also the Cluain Mhuire site. One can go through the list. These are all SHDs and, as we know, at a national level will provide 43,000 homes. They are mostly one-bed and two-bed apartments and permission has been given through the mechanism by which these speculators, frankly parasites, operate. How many units have been delivered? A total of 700. When they are delivered the rents are shocking, as is the cost of building them, as the quantity surveyors pointed out to us. This is what is actually going on. SHDs are just a means to print money for property developers and they are totally unaffordable for ordinary families, with shockingly high rents. Will the Minister get rid of the SHD process and instead start to build affordable housing on public land?</p>

          <p eId="para_791">Deputy Boyd Barrett has spoken about SHDs in Dublin and I want to talk about one in Cork at the old Ford distribution site in the marina, which is part of the Cork docklands site spanning 146 ha. This represents a real opportunity for public housing to be built on public land, both social and affordable housing. There is a large number of publicly-owned sites at Cork docklands including the ESB lands, the Marina, the Marina park, Kent Station, which is considered part of the docklands development site, the Camp Field, Páirc Uí Chaoimh, Tivoli docks, the old National Oil Reserves Agency premises, as well as the old Ford distribution site. These sites present huge opportunities for public housing on public land.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> The case for public housing on public land has been strengthened by Covid-19. In September last year the ESRI stated that the State should increase its investment in social and affordable housing now to offer future supply to deal with the supply shock caused by Covid. Residential property prices were stagnant last year but are expected to increase by 4% this year because of shortages of supply. Approximately 35,000 homes will be needed in the State each year in response to demographic changes but barely more than half of that number were delivered last year, estimated at less than 20,000. </p>
          <p eId="para_793"> What is up at the Cork docklands? Privatisation is what is up. The LDA will oversee the biggest privatisation programme in the history of the State in the coming years, with 60% of public land to be used for private development at market prices, 30% for so-called affordable housing and only 10% for social housing. The 60% at market rates will be beyond the means of young workers and those on the average wage, while the 30% at so-called affordable rates will be at market price less €50,000, on average, which is also beyond the reach of many of the workers I mentioned. </p>
          <p eId="para_794"> What is happening at the Ford distribution site? An application for a strategic housing development with more than 1,000 apartments has been lodged. What price will those apartments be? Will they be affordable for young workers and those on the average wage or are young people and workers on average pay going to be priced out of the market yet again? This is a big mistake and the privatisation should be reversed. We should be building public housing on public land, including social housing for people on the lists and genuinely affordable housing for working people at reasonable prices, not market rates or market rates minus €50,000. </p>

          <p eId="para_795">I will do my best to respond in the 23 seconds remaining. Under the programme for Government, the SHDs will expire at the end of the year. That is what has been agreed between the three parties. I believe in public housing on public land. I believe in real affordable housing but I also believe in delivering it. I do not know whether Deputy Barry, when he was a councillor in Cork, ever voted for a development plan but I sincerely doubt it. We will move forward with the biggest single investment in public housing in the history of the State this year. We have provided €3.3 billion for housing. Our plan was to deliver 12,750 new public homes but that will be impacted by Covid. We may be blamed for that too but we will do our damnedest to deliver public and affordable homes for working people and will do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_796">I welcome the opportunity to analyse and discuss the Government's housing policy, particularly in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had a terrible impact on our society and economy, with more than 3,120 people dying and many more seriously ill. This has put huge pressure on our front-line healthcare workers. Rightly, the Government has moved to suppress the virus, a strategy that will continue as the vaccines are rolled out.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> While necessary, it is expected that the Covid restrictions will have an impact on overall housing supply in 2021. I welcome the fact that the Minister has kept social housing projects open and that regulations on other essential sites will be published later today. It is critical we continue building these badly needed homes and essential projects. Covid indicators are showing an improvement and hopefully it will be possible for the construction sector to restart when the situation is next reviewed. </p>
          <p eId="para_798"> Unlike many on the Opposition benches who offer no realistic solutions, the Minister has taken concrete steps to help families at risk of homelessness. New rental legislation introduced over the past six months provides greater protection for renters and families. The ban on evictions has been strengthened and extended and record funding has been provided to bring vacant homes back into use. The target is 1,189 in Dublin alone and 3,620 nationally. I welcome this and ask the Minister to ensure that this work continues into 2022. The results of all of this are clear. Homeless figures have fallen by 18.8% over the past year, meaning that over 2,000 families were supported out of homelessness. While the numbers of homeless people are still far too high, the progress to date should be acknowledged and must continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> Many Irish people want to own their own home and I welcome the supports given to first-time buyers, particularly through the help-to-buy scheme, which assisted 21,000 people to get on the property ladder. I would welcome other supports that provide affordable homes and also an expansion of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme. In my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire, we are seeing a phenomenal amount of housing construction, especially along the Luas green line corridor. The housing stock in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is projected to grow at almost four times the national average over the next ten years. The proposed LDA development of almost 600 social and affordable on lands in Shanganagh will provide much-needed housing locally. I ask the Minister to continue to liaise with his colleagues, particularly the Ministers for Transport and for Public Expenditure and Reform, to ensure public transport and green infrastructure projects are developed in tandem with new housing developments. </p>
          <p eId="para_800"> I welcome the publication of the general scheme of the affordable housing Bill. There is great interest in an affordable housing scheme. Unfortunately some on the Opposition benches dismissed the Bill out of hand before they had even seen it but as they have always opposed affordable housing schemes, this is no great surprise. I look forward to examining the Bill in detail as it proceeds through the Oireachtas. I wish to acknowledge the work the Minister, his officials and local authority staff have done over the past year. As we begin to exit from the Covid restrictions in the coming months, I ask that a greater degree of urgency be attached to development.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">The moratorium on evictions remains in place for the duration of Level 5 restrictions, which is vital. The deadline for applications for local authority mortgage payment breaks has been extended until 31 March 2021 but that does not go far enough and I ask the Minister to look at it again. What are we doing for private mortgage holders? Is the Government actively calling on the banks to do the right thing and reinstate mortgage and loan payment breaks? I have had many phone calls from people who are out of work through no fault of their own and who are finding it very hard to pay their mortgages. I ask the Minister to revert to me on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> Last week I highlighted the case of the Carlow man who was turned away from an emergency accommodation hostel in Dublin. I was in contact with the Minister about it and have been working with a member of the man's family in Carlow and Carlow County Council to get the issue sorted. We are continuing to work on the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> I welcome the affordable housing Bill. It is important that the Government builds affordable housing for those people who do not meet the criteria for inclusion on the local authority housing list. What is the situation with regard to the income threshold review? It has been ten years since the income thresholds were last reviewed. The review must be completed urgently because we are in a different time. I ask the Minister to come back to me in that regard. We also need to build more local authority housing. </p>
          <p eId="para_804"> I cannot let the Minister go without asking him about the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, which is so important to me. I have been in touch with the Department constantly to find out the timescale on that. I believe it will be announced in February but I ask the Minister to confirm that today. That fund is important for Project Carlow 2040. We all welcome the good news that institutes of technology in the south east will be granted technological university status in 2022. That is very welcome. We are very lucky in Carlow to have two excellent third-level institutions but we need to make sure that we have proper infrastructure in and around Carlow town itself for the people of the town and the wider county. We also need to look at local authority housing provision, affordable housing and ensuring that those who need to rent are able to do so. I look forward to the Minister's answers.</p>

          <p eId="para_806">I am thinking of the many people in my constituency who have approached me about the issue of affordable housing, some of whom may be tuning into this debate this afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">They can see Opposition spokesperson after Opposition spokesperson getting angrier than one another during their slots, which are the right length for Facebook, in order to get a video. They gesticulate at the Minister and give him 50 seconds to answer five questions, 11 seconds to answer two or 30 seconds to answer four questions although they do not want the answers. The people who do want the answers are the people in my constituency who want affordable housing. The people who want the answers are councillors around the country who want the tools to vote in favour of the schemes their officials put before them. The Minister has not had the time to answer the questions because he has not been given it. </p>
          <p eId="para_808"> Deputy O'Reilly asked the Minister where the houses were six months into his first term. I imagine that, had the Minister started building a house himself when he was elected, it would not yet be complete. I will tell the Deputy what the Minister has done. The single-stage approval process for councils for developments up to €6 million gives every council in the country permission to start building on sites. Fingal County Council has confirmed that it is already preparing for work on five sites in the constituency of the Minister and Deputy O'Reilly. In Dublin City Council's jurisdiction, sites are being prepared in my own area of Ballymun. </p>
          <p eId="para_809"> The affordability element is also key. We have published the general scheme of an affordable housing Bill that has three components. These are public housing on public land and affordable housing, the shared equity scheme and the cost-rental scheme. These are three answers, three tools and three ways to deliver mixed-tenure and mixed-income developments. They are three reasons for every councillor to vote in favour of development on sites that come before them.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> To the Opposition I say that while it is important to highlight the problem, this Government is about delivering housing. It is in this business for one reason only. It is not to line a developer's pocket or to increase the share price of a construction company. That is not why I am in politics and it is not why Deputies Murnane O'Connor, Devlin and Flaherty and the Minister are in office. We are in office to build homes for the people who contact us and who need to live in those homes. We are going to do it and we are going to give people the answers they have been seeking for more than ten years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_811">I thank Deputy McAuliffe for his intervention and for affording me some time to respond to some of the charges. The level of aggression, particularly from the Sinn Féin Members in the questioning and barraging in which they have engaged, has been telling. I get a sense that the reason they are so focused on the affordable housing scheme is that they do not want it to work because they want people to be disaffected. They do not want the housing crisis to be dealt with. They see the progress being made by this new Government of the Green Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in housing and in driving down homelessness figures in a short space of time. Deputy Ó Broin, the main Opposition spokesperson on housing, was even critical of the fact that we had brought 3,600 public homes back into use over a six-month period. That really smacks of the fact that they will use any opportunity to advance their political cause, which relates to them and them alone. It certainly is not for our country and the good of our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> As a party and as the Government, we believe in home ownership. I have said that time and time again. I have never voted against affordable housing in the Oireachtas but Sinn Féin and Deputies Ó Broin, Doherty and O'Reilly have. Deputy O'Reilly questioned me about the constituency in which I have lived my whole life and which I have seen develop over that time. I wonder if she has told any constituents who have been in contact with her about wanting to buy a home that her party, Sinn Féin, opposes the first-time buyer's grant, the €30,000 grant which this Government increased to help people get on the housing ladder? When answering the phone or answering emails, does she tell people that her party opposes assistance for first-time buyers? I wonder does Deputy Ó Broin. He probably does but I am not sure. </p>
          <p eId="para_813"> We will deliver 400 cost-rental homes this year for the first time. This Government has dealt with that issue within a six-month period. It is a priority of this Government made up of the Green Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and we will deliver on it. Some on the Opposition side do not want to see that happening and that is fine, but I think people see through it. They see through the noise and aggression of Deputy Ó Broin and of Mr. Angry himself, Deputy Doherty. That is fine; people are used to that. What we are about is delivering solutions for people, driving down homelessness, building homes for people and making sure that our young people have a chance to own and live in their own home. It should not be forgotten that the budget, which Sinn Féin also opposed, included the single biggest housing budget in the history of the State which is to deliver 12,750 public homes on public land. I also remind people that the biggest serial objectors to housing, both public and private, across the country are Sinn Féin and their colleagues on the hard left.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mairéad Farrell<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_814">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire. He will find that, on Galway City Council, it is actually Fianna Fáil councillors who voted against certain public housing being built. I am glad that he wants to hear constructive solutions. I will get straight into them.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> A report released on Monday by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland stated that the construction cost of two-bedroom apartments in urban areas of Dublin now stands at between €219,000 and €262,000. Despite this, the council's own figures for social housing apartment projects, which are built on council-owned land, show prices averaging between €304,000 and €373,000, which is almost €100,000 more on average. In that report, the society calculates that the professional fees attached to the building of a two-bedroom apartment to be between €18,000 and €21,000 yet Dublin City Council was charged between €44,000 and €54,000 for the professional fees attached to its projects. One does not need to be a chartered accountant to see that something is clearly amiss. People have pointed out that there seems to be collusion between competitors to keep prices high. We need a normal functioning market. The State should be allowed to play its rightful part as a competitor, driving down these prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> Dublin City Council tells us:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_817">All our construction projects go through a thorough public procurement process in line with European Union and national regulations. At the end of that process the most economically advantageous tender is selected to carry out the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">This raises the question of for whom is it most economically advantageous. It is not just the cost that is a problem. The reality is that it takes at least 18 months from a council deciding to build public housing to actually being able to deliver it. The timeline for project completions is astonishingly long. Before it could build social homes at Cornamona Court in Ballyfermot, it took Dublin City Council four years to get final stage approval from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for those 61 homes. For the 30 social homes built at North King Street near Smithfield, it took the council just under four years to get final stage approval from the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> One of Fianna Fáil's supposed big achievements in the area of social housing was to increase the value of projects eligible for single-stage approval. This was increased from €2 million to €6 million. The increase in the number of houses this has brought about has been minimal and the increase in turnaround time has been negligible. It is quite clear that the procurement process in respect of the provision of social housing has failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> There are ways to address this. The Minister has asked us to outline ways in which this and the delivery of social housing can be improved so here we are. We need a radical overhaul of the procurement process. We need to allow councils to develop long-term relationships with builders. We absolutely need increased competition in the marketplace. We need to look at establishing a publicly-owned construction company. We also need to go back to direct build. This is the kind of realism and honesty that we need in the housing system. We need to fundamentally change the procurement process to deliver social housing and to finally remove the shackles and red tape that is hindering the councils' ability to deliver. </p>
          <p eId="para_821"> I take issue with what the Minister said earlier about Sinn Féin not wanting houses to be built. In Galway City Council, we have consistently supported the building and delivery of housing at times when Fianna Fáil members of the council did not. I ask an tAire to remove the red tape and to outline directly how he is going to make it easier for councils to fast-track the building and provision of public housing.</p>

          <p eId="para_822">I thank the Deputy for her contribution but our changes have not failed. They have been in place for less than six months. We have increased the eligibility limit for the single-stage approval process to €6 million. I have met the chief executives and directors of services of all the main local authorities either virtually or in person to set their housing targets for 2021, leaving aside Covid. The change to the single-stage approval process will work but it needs to be given a little bit of time. Even the Deputy and her party colleagues might think that a new process for the procuring of social homes should be allowed four months to bed in.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Let us give that time to allow it to happen. I welcome any constructive suggestions that are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> On costs, I met with the SCSI yesterday. Its report is very telling. One thing it states is that the cost of the building of apartments in suburban areas has dropped by between 4% and 9%. That is not always reported.</p>

          <p eId="para_826">Last Friday, a 69-year-old man known as Iggy, who was originally from Poland, was found dead in a laneway off Little Catherine Street in Limerick city. Pauline Casey and Sarah Beasley, an Aontú representative and homeless activist in Limerick, knew Iggy from their work in helping the homeless. They spoke to Iggy on the night he died. This was especially poignant for Pauline because she had lost her sister Louise on the streets in 2016. I know that gardaí in Limerick city are involved and that efforts are under way to try to repatriate Iggy's remains to his native Poland. The Minister may know about this particular case and may be able to update us as to the efforts in this regard. My party, Aontú, is happy to see if it can help to raise funds for some of the costs associated with the repatriation of Iggy’s remains. God rest his soul.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> Iggy is just one of the people who have died in homelessness in the past year. I raised this issue in the House in October, November and December. The Minister mentioned a previous Deputy leaving the Chamber before the debate had finished. In two of those debates, before I rose to speak and provide this information on the floor of the House, the Minister had left. He would not have heard my contribution in respect of these particular cases. I was the one who brought to the floor of the Dáil the information that just under 60 people had died in homelessness in Dublin city last year. This figure was higher than those for the two previous years, which is shocking. An RTÉ journalist had a camera in front of the Minister on a site where houses were being built and asked him a question on the figures I had brought to the Dáil that day. The Minister responded by saying that he would hold an investigation into the deaths of people in homelessness which have happened in Dublin in the past year. Where stands that investigation? Is it near completion and will the Minister share the details of what is known so far with the House?</p>

          <p eId="para_828">I thank Deputy Tóibín for his question. The Deputy will understand why I will not refer to a specific case, but every death of a person accessing homeless services is an absolute tragedy. My condolences and those of the Government go to that gentleman, his family and his friends. I said that we would investigate this issue. The deaths of those accessing homeless services constitute a complex issue, as the Deputy is aware. I have written to him before stating that many who unfortunately die while accessing homeless services may do so in emergency accommodation for other reasons, with complex health needs and other elements involved. There was a worrying increase in this regard in 2020, which I have accepted and acknowledged to the Deputy. As outlined in the reply to a parliamentary question, I commissioned a detailed report on this issue. Dr. Jo-Hanna Ivers of Trinity College is compiling that for us right now and her work is nearing completion. I expect that Dr. Ivers will complete her work in the first quarter. I stated in replies to parliamentary questions on the matter that when the report is completed, I will certainly publish it. We will engage with the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the report. That is where the matter stands at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_829">I also raised at that time the fact that homeless people who were not from Dublin and who were presenting to homeless facilities were being turned away and told to go back to their own counties. This was despite the fact that another arm of the State was telling them not to travel because of the Covid-19 restrictions. Months after I raised that issue, the Minister appeared on the "RTÉ Investigates" programme and he seemed to be shocked by what had been uncovered, even though I had brought details in that regard to the floor of the House previously. The truth is that what I am referring to here has happened again since. Five instances have been reported to me of people who are homeless in Dublin being told that, as they are not from the county, they cannot avail of the relevant services. The Minister stated earlier that it is up to particular Deputies to make this information known to him. However, he has responsibility in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> There is an organisation, Inner City Helping Homeless, which is on the front line night after night. It has made requests to appear before the committee in Leinster House. Opposition Deputies on that committee have requested that it be facilitated in this regard. I understand, however, that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green Party Deputies have refused to allow Inner City Helping Homeless to appear before the committee and bring to people's attention the information it possesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> I also tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister on the number of people from the other 25 counties in the State who died in homelessness in the past year. In his reply, the Minister stated that he did not know and that figures in this regard do not exist. Pleading ignorance in respect of an issue of this importance is not a reasonable response. How can we tackle a situation if the Minister is unaware of the scale of it? What is the situation with regard to homeless deaths in Limerick and in the other 24 counties outside Dublin? Why is information in this regard not collected?</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> The other question I asked the Minister previously is when are we going to have the standardisation of services for homelessness within the State? There is a great variation as to the provision of services for homeless people. That is one of the reasons many people sleep in tents and on the streets, night after night. Can the Minister answer those two questions, please?</p>

          <p eId="para_833">I will do my level best to try to do so. No one is operating with any degree of ignorance here. I assure the Deputy of that. I have already answered on the issue of homeless deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> On local connection, the Deputy did raise this issue in the Dáil previously. This process was changed and that did not just happen just on foot of what the Deputy had said. I announced the change on 7 December and issued an instruction to all local authorities, not just those in Dublin, in a letter dated 9 December. Local connection is not a barrier to anybody accessing emergency accommodation. I chair a homelessness task force with our homelessness partners and agencies, including Depaul, the Simon Communities of Ireland, Focus Ireland, the Dublin Regional Housing Executive and others. I recently visited homeless facilities in Limerick and Waterford where real progress is being made. Let us put this in context. I am saying that the local connection is not a barrier. I know the Deputy wants to come in but he might let me answer the question. If he just wants to speak, then I cannot answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> On homeless services, let us recognise the fact that the homelessness rate is down nearly 19% year-on-year, which is welcome. Child and family homelessness is down nearly 40% year-on-year. We will publish our quarterly report tomorrow and it will show that there has been a further reduction, which is to be welcomed. We commend those who are working in the sector and assisting us in finding permanent solutions for people and getting them out of homelessness.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">People listening to this debate will think that it is absolutely scandalous and flabbergasting that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage does not know the number of people who die in homelessness in 25 of the 26 counties in this State, that there is no process to collect information in this regard or collate it centrally and that such information is not at his fingertips. If he cannot analyse or measure a critical problem of lives being lost, how in God’s name is he supposed to be able to fix it?</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> On the "RTÉ Investigates" programme to which I refer, statistics were provided which showed that a large number of people who are homeless become drug addicts after they become homeless. Sometimes we hear a debate to the effect that people are responsible for their own misfortunes. They certainly are not. People have been failed by the system in this country. The only safety nets that are being provided to many are those offered by the charities and the individuals who are out, night after night. In the context of the debate on this matter, we need to pay attention to the work they are doing and commend them on it. Will the Minister meet representatives from Inner City Helping Homeless and get from them some of the details they possess regarding the reality on the streets?</p>

          <p eId="para_839">I acknowledge the major strides the Minister has made to date in the provision of housing. It remains the biggest challenge facing the country. Now more than ever, I am reassured and convinced that we will finally get to grips with this crisis with this Minister at the helm. I raise the issue of index-shared ownership loans. In the pre-2003 version of the shared ownership scheme, the equity component was linked with the consumer price index, CPI. Longford County Council has 21 of these pre-2003 shared ownership loans active. Unfortunately, the challenge and difficulty are that the bearer of each loan entered the agreement on the basis that it was a straight shared ownership mortgage and the expectation was that the repayments were paying down the mortgage costs in their entirety. For example, one couple who have worked assiduously throughout their working lives to pay off their mortgage were recently shocked to learn that they still owe €24,000 on the loan as a result of the equity component. In a second case, an owner who has been in his property since 1992 is anxious to put his affairs in order as he nears retirement age. He, too, was shocked to learn that he still has to pay off as much as €96,000 on his property, especially as he was paying €90 a week in rent and what he assumed was his €264 mortgage every month. That rounds up to a total monthly payment of €654, a not insignificant sum. He has now learned he was not paying down the full mortgage amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> All of the 21 householders in question went into this scheme in the earnest expectation that they would one day own their own homes outright. Many of them are now at an age where it will simply not be practical to seek a mortgage to address the equity component of the agreement. In most instances, banks will probably not consider them for funding as there is already a loan in place on the house. I ask the Minister to engage with the Department and undertake an earnest review of this matter. These are honest, decent and hard-working people who have paid their bills, rent and loans, all in the expectation of one day owning their own homes. It is hard not to argue with their contention that it seems that a sneaky little piece of small print now stands in the way of that dream coming true. That is simply not fair.</p>

          <p eId="para_842">Most of the debate here has been about housing and that is also the issue which I want to raise, but in a different way. I represent the constituency of Louth and east Meath where large housing developments are proceeding apace, particularly around Drogheda. The whole town is chock-a-block with traffic and major development needs remain unmet in the context of its designation as a regional growth centre in the national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> The biggest issue in Drogheda at the moment is what is called the port access northern cross route, PANCR, project. Planning permission has been granted for more than 5,000 homes but the required infrastructure is not in place to build them. The homes are a mix of private, social and affordable housing, and the project includes schools and sports developments, including Drogheda United's new pitch. This development is predicated on finance being provided to the local authority under the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF. What is the position regarding that funding? I know the Minister is familiar with the matter, having visited the town recently where he met a number of people. Will he provide an update?</p>

          <p eId="para_844">Yes, I will gladly do so. I know the Deputy's constituency well and also the area to which he referred. It is a designated growth area providing much-needed homes. The assessment of URDF applications has concluded and the work of assessing applications is ongoing, with a view to making announcements in this regard in the first quarter, hopefully by the end of February. While that may not be possible, the timeframe is certainly February or March. I note and recognise the Deputy's full support for the project, and he has been in correspondence with me in support of it and on issues concerning the town as a whole. There will be an announcement in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_845">I also raise the national issue of housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies and inspections being restricted because of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the last year in Dublin, 10,500 homes were inspected for basic human needs, namely, adequate water, light, etc. Some 76% of these homes failed the inspections. I welcome the change the Minister made in the regulations requiring landlords to provide photographs of damage and the issues that have to be addressed before homes can be considered to meet the basic minimum living requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> These are appalling cases. This week, I was contacted by a woman with young children regarding accommodation where the roof was literally falling in. Nothing was being done by the landlord and the county council did not have the capacity to visit. It took me, as a Deputy, to contact the housing manager in the county council to get the matter resolved. I support the Minister's commitment to change in this area and the funding being provided to local authorities to fast-track the inspection of homes through the photographic method, and also making those homes safe and available with the basic minimum standards required.</p>

          <p eId="para_847">The Deputy has made a good point. We have changed the regulations to permit that method of inspection and we encourage all local authorities to proceed on that basis. The pandemic poses difficulties for local authorities but there is no reason people should be living in substandard accommodation. In the budget, we also allocated significant additional funding for the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and inspectors in local authorities to ensure inspections take place and accommodation is at the required standard. If there are specific issues concerning accommodation in Louth, I am more than happy for Deputy O'Dowd to correspond with me directly. We will engage with the local authority to ensure that happens.</p>

          <from>Deputy Neasa Hourigan<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_848">I return to the issues raised in the "RTÉ Investigates" programme on homeless services operating in Dublin. They will be of concern to the NGOs involved and to my colleagues on Dublin City Council, including Councillor Janet Horner and the Lord Mayor, Councillor Hazel Chu. I return to the issue of local connection, which was rightly raised by Deputy Toíbín. The letter to which the Minister referred outlines a response that will pertain only to the cold weather period, which obviously will not last.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> We have also had assurances from local authorities that they will apply maximum discretion when enforcing the supposed local connection rule. We need more than this. I propose that an instruction in legislation or perhaps a circular be issued providing that this is not a matter of maximum discretion but an obligation on local authorities to provide emergency accommodation where the alternative is for someone to sleep rough on the streets. No one should be forced to forgo the safety and dignity of a bed and a roof over his or her head in a city where thousands of empty properties are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> A key concern for service users is safety in emergency accommodation centres. We are awaiting a report from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, and the HSE regarding the standards in emergency accommodation centres in Dublin. I ask the Minister to give an undertaking that this report will be published promptly and in full. I also ask him to ensure that all staff in emergency accommodation facilities are Garda-vetted and trained to deal in a sensitive way with people in a deeply vulnerable position. That is currently not the case, and many such workers are not vetted by the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> From 2016 to 2020, the budget for homelessness services in Dublin has increased from €96 million to €200 million. This partly reflects the growing scale of the homelessness crisis in Dublin, but it also reflects the growing use of private emergency accommodation facilities. We see private emergency accommodation in the north inner city as returning a 100% annual profit on running costs under a ten-year contract with Dublin City Council. This is a significant profit for a service over which we have very little - I would say it is insufficient - oversight.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> Contracts for providing emergency accommodation are not subject to the public procurement process that would be the norm for other services contracted in the State. We must procure services which are care-based and underpinned by respect for the dignity of the individuals using the service, not locking people into homelessness for profit. We need to eradicate rather than manage homelessness in the long term. With regard to the short and medium term, however, will the Minister outline details in respect of procurement and oversight of private providers in this sector, Garda vetting of staff in emergency accommodation, the status of the report on standards of accommodation in homelessness in Dublin and the status of guidance given to local authorities on maximum discretion, which he has touched on?</p>

          <p eId="para_853">I thank Deputy Hourigan for her question and the points raised. I want to be clear, once more, that the issue of local connection is not a barrier to anyone accessing emergency accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I followed up that letter of the 9th, which the Deputy referred to, of an announcement I had made on the 7th, and have had a meeting since with the local authorities, with housing officers and with the DRHE. I have had a couple of meetings quite recently and we followed that up with an additional letter, which I am happy to share with the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> We have capacity in our cities. We have emergency capacity and it should be used. I agree with the Deputy that we must recognise and reduce the need to use emergency accommodation, which is happening. We are looking at the capacity within our hostels that is not being used because people are being moved into permanent accommodation. Up to 3,600 voids came back into the system in 2020, and many of those were focused on homeless individuals and families where we have been able to house them permanently. This is absolutely what we want to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> I do not have time to respond to all of the items raised but I will respond to each item directly in writing.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> With regard to private accommodation and procurement, many of those elements of private accommodation were procured quickly in times of emergency when accommodation was needed. Thankfully we are starting to move away from that emergency response. I will respond in more detail to the Deputy in writing.</p>

          <p eId="para_858">I have two and a half minutes and I would like to get an answer on this if I can, please. With regard to the 2021 statutory regulation whereby "housing construction and completion works ongoing on the 8th day of January 2021, where such works are scheduled to be completed by 31st day of January 2021 and will render the home under construction capable of occupation by that date", we have big problems. The regulations provide that: "Essential works on vacant residential properties, owned or controlled by a local authority" can be carried out until "28th day of February 2021". I have people in rental accommodation who are two weeks away from finishing their houses. They are waiting on windows for places that are being renovated so they can finish their houses. The local authority can do it up until 28 February but anyone with a one-off house is paying rent and paying a mortgage, yet they cannot do it. We have been talking about social housing and yet we have people who want to get into their houses. We need this statutory regulation changed and to bring in guidelines for the local authorities as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_859">Those are regulations from the first level 5 restrictions earlier this month. The regulations are being worked through right now and will be published later on this evening or tomorrow. Obviously, where people need certain works done so they can get into their house in the short term, we ask them to take a pragmatic and realistic approach on that and if someone is a week away from getting into a house that the work would continue in a safe manner to allow that family have a safe home. We are doing further work with regard to the social housing. Those discussions are still ongoing in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> I expect the revised regulations referred to by the Deputy to be published later this evening, or at the latest in the morning, and they will be available to everyone. I will also ask local authorities directly to be pragmatic in their approach with people during these difficult times. The Deputy can come back to me with any specific queries he may have in that regard.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelCollins2016" eId="spk_453">
          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_861">The latest figures from the Department show that 10,440 men, women and children were homeless in November, up 5% on the year before. More than a decade after Ireland experienced Europe's biggest property crash, the housing and property market remains in difficulty. The Central Bank of Ireland estimates that the State will need 34,000 new homes a year over the next decade to keep up with demand. Government policy on restricting planning permission for one-off rural housing due to the stringent measures in place within the national planning framework are having a major impact. Overall problems with Ireland's planning system are causing significant delays in the delivery of homes, especially one-off houses. Recent updated research from the Central Bank sets out how Irish banks under the watch of this Government are charging, on average, interest rates that are twice the EU average. This has the impact of a loan costing €60,000 more over the lifetime of a 30-year mortgage. Many mortgage holders are paying three times the EU average for the same loans. There is a lack of empathy from the Government for people who are trying to pay mortgages during this pandemic with no jobs, no way of getting a job and no moratorium. This is not good enough. At the end of this pandemic we will have many more people in our court system trying to hold on to their family homes. Yet again we will see the vulture funds fly in and swoop up these homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> In the short time I have left I will discuss rural planning, which is becoming an absolute and utter nightmare for people. It is becoming more and more difficult. More fences must be jumped and people cannot get planning, including young people. The Minister will be aware, as I am, that when we set up our homes people are delighted to get the planning permission and get the project off the ground. It is a nightmare now. In some localities, for example, the person must be living there for seven years. If someone comes to work in a community and wants to live in that community he or she cannot, unless he or she buys a house. He or she cannot build a house. There is also an issue with proximity. This week alone I have dealt with eight or ten planning issues. Every one of them has a little bit of a problem, perhaps a small or tedious thing, and they cannot get over that. The Minister must look at it. Some of these people are then going to need assistance with housing but if they have two jobs their income might be over the threshold and they cannot get HAP, and yet they cannot get a loan if their income is not enough. It is a complete farce and the Government is standing over it year in and year out. I ask the Minister to reply to me in writing on the matter because I am running out of time. I ask that he would look at this and allow people to at least make an application for planning permission and give them help with every effort they make to get their feet off the ground in their start in life.</p>

          <p eId="para_863">As with Deputy Collins, I have very significant issues with rural planning and with planning in general and how slow it is. There needs to be transparency around the Part V and the Part 8 process operated by the county councils. Some councils are very fluid, lax and bullish about it. There is a Part 8 process in Tipperary town currently for road works and 291 submissions went in. These were sought and are to be welcomed but then the officials fly in the face of submissions and refuse to listen to the 75% majority that is against the works. There is a bullish attitude by Tipperary County Council in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> I wrote to the Minister and spoke with him about Cormack Drive in Nenagh and an old Part 8 process going back perhaps 20 years. When does a Part 8 process finish? The residents never got letters to say their submissions were dealt with and that it was finished. They are now forced to go into court.</p>

          <p eId="para_866">I wrote to the Minister after a debate in October or November. The residents are being forced to take legal action. That is not right. The county council kept on building these houses. We are all for houses but in this area the only green area they had was taken up. There are heaps of other sites. There is one site down the road with 25 or 30 acres on it. They insisted in building on a green area and the residents have been forced to go to court. The county council kept building in spite of the fact that they were legally told to stop until the decision was made in the courts. That is very wrong and is no way democratic or fair.</p>

          <p eId="para_876">That is great. It is an absolutely damning indictment of every Government's housing policy. Simon does not say that, of course; they simply give us a snapshot. This is the eighteenth snapshot. Let us consider Galway city and the suburbs, which are divided into two categories. There is not one property available under the HAP limits in Galway city. There are three in the suburbs. Simon has done a number of these reports and this is the eleventh time out of 16 reviews where no property is available. I ask the Minister to really look at that and perhaps come back to tell us we need a new approach to housing. I believe that he believes in public housing but I think he is a bit mixed up in his head on some issues. I wish to put on the record that I believe in public housing on public land. It is a must. We must give a strong message to the market that we need public housing on public land. Let us listen to that word "public". It takes in quite a variation of types of houses and cost-rental.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">My second question is, again, one to which I would like to get a "Yes" or "No" reply.

          <p eId="para_897">We talk about building houses. There is currently a problem with flooding in Lough Funshinagh, County Roscommon. Will the Department and especially the NPWS help in every way and not obstruct solutions to that problem?</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> Second, people build one-off houses in rural Ireland. There might be one or two, at most, on site. At present, they are off-site due to the Covid regulations. Is that prudent if there are only one or two people in a one-off house in the middle of the countryside?</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> Third, there are 35,000 units of State land throughout the country. Is it prudent to have councils, housing agencies, private builders and vulture funds buying private lands outside those and considering houses? The fast-track planning system for developments of more than 100 houses is being challenged left, right and centre in the courts. Will anything be done about this? I have examined it in the past fortnight and it has stopped 1,400 or 1,500 houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> Regarding horticultural peat, will the Minister introduce planning permission to resolve this issue across the country? With regard to legislation for natural heritage areas, NHAs, a solar farm in the Nore Valley in Tipperary cannot proceed because the NHAs that were to be de-designated have not been de-designated. The matter was due to come back before the Dáil because an amendment was made in the Seanad. Will that be brought back to the Dáil?</p>

          <p eId="para_901">I will deal with some of the questions and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, will respond to the question about horticultural peat.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> On housing, it is unfortunate that we have had to close the construction sector in the interests of public safety and to reduce the movement of people. There are some exemptions and those regulations will be updated and published later tonight. The Deputy will see the exemptions. I take his point as I am familiar with rural housing. My constituency has a large rural area in which one-off rural houses are also prevalent but it is difficult to differentiate between one type of house and another. I am focused on getting the sector reopened fully on 5 March.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> The Minister of State will answer the question about horticultural peat and the planning. I will respond to the Deputy in writing on the other items. I will also respond to Deputy Connolly once she clarifies the report to which she referred. I am happy to do so in the interest of answering the question that was put.</p>

We are hoping, further to discussion with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to make it exempt from planning and that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, would regulate it under the Environmental Protection Agency Act. There is an issue with legislating for retrospective environmental impact assessment, EIA, and we are in discussions about that.</p>

            <p eId="para_907">I am particularly thankful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue. It arose before Christmas, but due to issues outside everybody's control it was not possible to reach it until now.</p>
            <p eId="para_908"> This situation arose with the reconstruction of Maynooth Boys' National School, which is on a dangerous junction with heavy traffic. It is adjacent to Maynooth Post Primary School, which has recently been vacated and moved to a new site about half a mile away. That leaves the future of the existing premises to be dealt with in a number of ways. Incidentally, this has been agreed in general over the past number of years. Provision for a Gaelcholáiste was previously mooted and agreed at local level. There was also provision for a local swimming pool to be shared between Maynooth University and the local community, which is awaiting funding at present. The use of the facilities there by Maynooth boys' school on a temporary basis while construction of the new school is taking place was sought and agreed between the respective school authorities. There was no difficulty with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_909"> However, approval has not yet emerged. That is important because it is essential that in this area of heavy traffic a means be found to facilitate the local agreement between the authorities in Maynooth Post Primary School and Maynooth Community College, the two schools that have vacated the site. All that is required is access for the pupils of the boys' school while the construction work is ongoing, as well as access for the students to the AstroTurf site and recreational facilities. This is accentuated by the fact that, at present, the boys' school is a building site. It is extremely important that the boys gain access to their school independently and without crossing over the building site, which would not be advisable.</p>
            <p eId="para_910"> It is important to bear in mind that these matters have been agreed locally and without any difficulty. I am happy to report that since tabling this Topical Issue I received clarification by way of a reply to a parliamentary question to the effect that the Gaelcholáiste is agreed and is going ahead as was intended. The other parts of the submission I made remain to be dealt with in whatever way is possible, which will be very beneficial to the pupils of the boys' primary school and to the local community in respect of the facilities that will eventually come on stream.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Deputy Josepha Madigan)<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_911">The Deputy will be aware that the property in which Maynooth Post Primary School was located until recently is owned by Kildare-Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB. The school is relocating to a new location. The property vacated by the school has been identified as the permanent location for the Gaelcholáiste, as the Deputy confirmed in his contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">The Gaelcholáiste will take up occupancy once the necessary work on the property is completed. My Department understands that the movement of the Gaelcholáiste to the vacated post-primary school property is a priority for KWETB. The latter has received an application from Maynooth Boys' National School to use the adjoining entrance in the vacated property for access to the school while work is under way on the national school. I note what the Deputy said about the school being like a building site.</p>
            <p eId="para_913"> The national school has also sought access to some of the school facilities, which the Deputy mentioned, like the AstroTurf pitch and recreational facilities. He will be pleased to note that following engagement between the national school and KWETB, agreement has been reached for the provision of access and car parking to the boys' national school on the vacated school site. Engagement is continuing regarding access to other school facilities on the site. As is the practice, this engagement will be undertaken locally between all the relevant parties, including other schools, with the objective of reaching an agreement regarding the use of these facilities. Any further queries on arrangements regarding the property concerned should be referred to KWETB. Any decision around disposal or lease of an ETB property would first have to be considered by the board and then approved by the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley. The boys' national school has approximately 560 pupils so it will need that access and I am delighted that it has now got it in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_914"> The Deputy mentioned access to the AstroTurf pitch and recreational facilities. The sort of accommodation that can be made around that would need to be addressed directly with the ETB. It would also have to be borne in mind that the Gaelscoil, which will take up occupancy in that site once works are completed, would have to be accommodated once it is ready to proceed. The Gaelscoil is currently in temporary accommodation in Manor Mills in Maynooth and once that work is completed it will be moving. The KWETB is also the patron of the Gaelcholáiste, which will have in the region of 500 pupils and is a co-educational school as well. We want to ensure the schools work together and that we can provide access for children. The Deputy mentioned earlier that the boys' national schools is situated at a very heavy junction so we want to ensure, for the children's health and safety, that they have that access and that car parking space. I am glad that has now been agreed between the respective parties. Any other outstanding issues can be agreed going forward between all the relevant parties. I thank the Deputy for his continuing concern and representations on behalf of these schools in order that we can provide adequate educational facilities for these school-going children.</p>

            <p eId="para_915">I thank the Minister of State and the Minister for the work they have done and for taking an interest in this issue in the past few weeks. Incidentally, the recreational demands of the area are considerable. Maynooth University borders the site and there are proposals to increase its student mass to 17,000 from where it stands currently at around 15,000. The recreational and outdoor space available there would be very useful in dealing with the recreational requirements of the area. It is of great importance that this matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of local interests who were always in agreement with it and did not have any difficulty at all coming to the accommodation that was sought by Maynooth Boys' National School. I again thank the Minister of State and her colleague for the work they have done on the issue. I anticipate the work that is still required over the next six months or so and recognise that when the construction work is completed on the boys' school, it will be able to revert to the original access, subject to any agreements that might emerge in the meantime.</p>

            <from>Deputy Josepha Madigan<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_916">I note what the Deputy says about Maynooth University and the 17,000 students who will attend it. I also note that Maynooth Post Primary School, which is the co-educational school I mentioned, has 1,120 pupils. There is quite a considerable amount of education going on in a very small, constricted area. That sort of collaboration and engagement between the relevant schoolgoing communities, as well as the third level institution, is extremely important because of health and safety and the recreational facilities. The Deputy spoke in his contribution about the proliferation of children crossing and recrossing an extremely busy road. All of those issues have to be taken into account. I hope some accommodation can be made regarding the recreational facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_917"> The Deputy's written submission refers to a swimming pool. The Department does not have any record of any proposal for a swimming pool on the site of the vacated property. If the Deputy is still interested in that particular topic, I suggest he take it up with KWETB as it may have some further information on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_918"> Accommodation could be made for the Maynooth Boys' National School regarding facilities as long as it has vacated the site by the time the Gaelcholáiste takes its place. As I said, there will be 500 pupils in a co-educational school coming into the vacated site so there is a great deal of construction going on. I thank the Deputy for his continued representations on this matter. I will bring this conversation to the attention of the Minister. We obviously want the works on both those schools to be expedited and to take place and be completed as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_919">I thank the Minister for taking this Topical Issue debate. Just a few streets away at the GPO on O'Connell Street, there are copies of a beautiful yellow and green glossy brochure available in the atrium. It is a report An Post commissioned a few years ago, namely, A New Vision for Post Office Services in Ireland. Within it, there are different subsections, including one relating to the consolidation of post office services, which is lovely flowery language for shutting down post offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_920"> In my constituency of Clare, we have discovered in the last few days that Broadford post office, which has existed since 1831 and been a permanent fixture in the village for 190 years, is now going to close. The postmaster, James O'Brien, and his family have done a fabulous job there in recent years but for very real, personal and genuine reasons, he has to retire and step back from the business, which we all respect in the community. An Post is seizing the opportunity of an individual stepping back from his role to shut down the facility. It says people can go 15 km over the road to Tulla or Ardnacrusha or a shorter distance to Kilkishen. That is irrelevant because as we have seen during Covid, more and more people are back in their home environments working from home and villages have become viable once more. It is illogical to do this and shutting down key services is just stripping the bedrock out of a village.</p>
            <p eId="para_921"> I know the Minister wants to see a vibrant rural Ireland but when post offices, local schools and shops are closed, the very rural Ireland we are trying to protect is hollowed out. An Post is hell-bent on doing this. This is quite a personal thing because An Post was happy for this post office to remain open for a long time but when an individual retires, suddenly the whole business plan for that community and its 15 km hinterland collapses. That is wrong. That is not how a post office system should work. If it was good enough to run last year or the year before and was profitable then it should be serving the heart of the community and its surrounding areas for many years to come.</p>

          <speech by="#JamesOConnor" eId="spk_493">
            <from>Deputy James O'Connor<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_922">I thank the Minister for being here to discuss the very important issues facing our postal services. I remind him that balanced regional development, of which post office services are an integral part, is a key pillar under the programme for Government. The 2020 Grant Thornton report identified the postal service as one of general economic interest due to its high public value but low commercial viability.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">The service is at a critical juncture. In terms of sustainability, I have some serious concerns about the latest moves of An Post. In my view, the management of An Post has moved the postal service from a mail company that happens to be a parcel service to a parcel service that is no longer concerned about mail delivery. This was evident in the closure of the Cork sorting centre. </p>
            <p eId="para_924"> I have serious concerns around the proposals for the introduction of a potential priority or economy postal system. From information I have gathered in recent days, it is being suggested that the cost of next-day delivery stamps will increase from €1 to €2 and a new lower class stamp will be considered for later delivery. This will create a class stamp system for postal services and could impact on hundreds of delivery jobs for our postmen and postwomen across the country, which will not be overcome by forced early retirement packages. This approach also undermines An Post's universal service obligation to deliver mail to every house in the State, every week day for a uniform price. How will this be addressed and is it compatible with the Communications Regulation (Postal Services ) Act 2011? I am extremely concerned about this matter. The postal service is a vital part of rural life and the fabric of rural society in Ireland. There has been a stripping of this service in recent times which is not welcomed by people in rural communities. We know how important they are. In many cases, people working in An Post are the only people some individuals, particularly old age pensioners, see each day. They have an important role to play in rural life, in my view. </p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Climate_and_Communications" eId="spk_494">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Eamon Ryan)<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_925">I thank Deputies Cathal Crowe and O'Connor for raising what is a critical issue for all of the people of our country, but particularly rural Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_926"> An Post's social value has been particularly evident during the recent and current Covid crisis. It has played a valuable role in its commitment to rural communities, the elderly and vulnerable in our society. I am acutely aware of the importance of maintaining a post office network and I note the serious decline in mail volumes and the impact of Covid-19 on footfall through post offices have had a severe impact on the postal network and the revenues being generated by postmasters. Since taking up my role as Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, I have met representatives of the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, to discuss the matters raised in the Grant Thornton report, which was commissioned by the IPU. </p>
            <p eId="para_927"> The programme for Government recognises that a modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for citizens and enterprises as part of our commitment to a sustainable national post office network. While it is long-standing Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_928"> In response to the structural challenges facing the postal sector generally and An Post, the company put in place a strategic plan for the medium-term and long-term future of the company. Government efforts are focused on supporting An Post in the roll-out of new services and the delivery of its strategic plan. The ongoing transformation in the company aims to ensure the financial viability of An Post and the continued fulfilment of its mandate to deliver a mail delivery service and a viable post office network. To implement the plan, the cost of which was estimated to be in the region of €150 million, the Minister for Finance provided a loan of €30 million to the company in December 2017 to support the renewal of the post office network at a cost of €15 million and the continued fulfilment of a five-day per week mail delivery service which accounted for a further €15 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_929"> An Post is continuing to undergo vital transformation as part of the delivery of its strategic plan, which has seen the company being split into two distinct business units, An Post mails and parcels and An Post retail. An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and formats. These include, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial service products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post money and a new business to business brand, An Post commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of €50 million in the network is about getting communities to use the enhanced services in their local post offices. </p>
            <p eId="para_930"> A recently approved capital expenditure programme is designed to develop the newer elements of An Post's financial services business and mitigate declining core mail volumes and revenues on the retail side of the business. An Post also invested in training for all post offices in 2019 and 2020 to better equip postmasters to run their business. The strategic plan in place to transform the company has resulted in An Post recording an operating profit of over €41 million for 2019, the third consecutive year of significant financial improvement, bringing the group out of its loss-making position of 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_931"> The Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of business, public and community life. With an evolving mandate, An Post can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community-focused services. As with any business, An Post needs to develop commercial strategies to enable it to grow and maintain its relevance for all its users. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensure a sustainable and viable post office network.</p>

            <p eId="para_932">The people of Broadford are taking this matter to heart. Last year, the previous year and the year before that their post office was viable, operational and functional. It was only when James O'Brien retired that the issue of consolidation or closure arose. Once this post office closes, it will not reopen again and 190 years of operations will be wiped out. This will hollow out the village and damage it forever.</p>
            <p eId="para_933"> In terms of costs and sustainability in the long term, it costs in the region of €70 million per annum to keep all 900 post offices operational. Cumulatively, they generate €53 million per annum in revenue, leaving a funding shortfall of €17 million. In a report commissioned last year by An Post, Grant Thornton identified that €17 million as money which the Government, in time, will have to step in and provide <i>vis-a-vis</i> a public service obligation. I ask the Minister to urgently look at this issue. I am told by postmasters that if things do not change, 600 of our 900 post offices may close by the autumn of this year, which would mean two-thirds of our post offices would be wiped out. Some of these post offices are as old as the Broadford post office, which, as I said, has been in operation for 190 years. They will be wiped out forever.</p>

            <p eId="para_934">I thank the Minister for his reply. We need to hammer home the message today of the importance of post office services across to the citizens of this State. They are an integral part rural life. I am concerned about the ramifications we may face in the next number of years in regard to this sector, particularly around the increasing costs of stamps and, in addition, the possibility of a two-tier system for mail delivery, which would be extremely concerning if it were to come about. It would have an adverse impact on the delivery service and the livelihood of people working in An Post. Every household in rural Ireland appreciates the people working for An Post who call to them daily and the availability of that service to them. If we are serious about allowing people to continue to work from home, perhaps to help the environment which is an important cause for the Minister, we should seek to protect this service. It is important that we do that as much as we can.</p>

            <p eId="para_935">I join Deputy Cathal Crowe in thanking James O'Brien and his family for their service to the community of Broadford over 190 years. The reality is that many post offices are family businesses that are trusted and respected and provide extensive services to their communities. I wish Mr. O'Brien well on his retirement. I regret that as of now, there does not appear to be anybody willing to take on the post office and keep it operational. I understand that this is a critical issue for the people of Broadford and, similarly, for hundreds of post offices and communities across the country, particularly in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_936"> We face a real challenge despite the really good work done in this area in terms of mediation. The work done by the Irish Postmasters Union and others in seeking solutions has been very progressive. The Covid crisis has worsened what was already a difficult situation. Footfall has declined by about 20% and there has been an acceleration in the decline in mail volumes, which was traditionally falling by about 7% per annum. That has accelerated to approximately 12%, I am told. There has been a commensurate increase in parcel delivery of approximately 100% but my understanding is that this does not benefit the post office. Some 80% of post office business is social welfare payments, bill pay, mail and State savings services. State savings have held up or risen slightly but the other three services have declined significantly in recent years despite all of the good work and efforts of postmasters, An Post and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">We have a real challenge in this regard and we have to be honest and upfront about it. New financial services offer one potential revenue stream. An Post has launched its Green Hub initiative, for example, which offers an opportunity for trusted postmasters to offer financial advice and financing for green home projects, such as home energy retrofits, in the same way that they manage State savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_938"> None of this is easy. I cannot sugar the pill for the people of Broadford and tell them there is an easy and immediate solution. Nevertheless, we do need to find a solution and we can do so by putting all our efforts towards ensuring that as many Government services and financial services as possible are available through the post office network. That is our best chance.</p>

            <p eId="para_939">In the greater scheme of things and in the middle of the Covid crisis, I am not sure that the issue I am raising is the most important one we could discuss. However, it struck me when I saw the story in question that it fitted well with the old adage that one should never waste a good crisis. Had we not been in the middle of a Covid lockdown and restrictions, the ESB might not have moved as quickly to do what it is doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_940"> The Georgian House Museum at No. 29 Fitzwilliam Street opened in 1991 to celebrate Dublin's status as European Capital of Culture. It was operated as a museum by the ESB and the National Museum of Ireland, offering an exhibition of Dublin Georgian home life from 1790 to 1820. The building was restored by the ESB as part of a deal with what was then Dublin Corporation. That deal was agreed more than a decade earlier to allow the company to exceed standard plot ratios in the expansion of its 1960s office complex. Some people will remember the destruction of Georgian Dublin in the 1960s, when eminent figures like the late Marian Finucane and the former President, Mary Robinson, fought hard, as students, to prevent it. When I was a young student, I had the privilege of being part of the campaign to stop the destruction of Wood Quay. That campaign was tragically lost to the vandalism of Dublin Corporation when it built its awful office buildings on top of what was the largest Viking site in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_941"> The part of Georgian Dublin in which the Georgian House Museum is located is the longest stretch of Georgian architecture anywhere in the world. The museum was offered as a sop to the people of Dublin by the ESB. It was to be allowed to carry out the development of its offices and, in return, it would provide the museum as some small form of compensation. Now the ESB is saying it does not want to reopen the museum after the building is refurbished. Given that it is the only publicly accessible Georgian period home in the city of Dublin and that we advertise Dublin as an architectural Georgian city for tourism purposes, this act of vandalism which is intended by the ESB should be reversed. I ask the Minister to lobby the ESB to stop it happening. I am not sure whether the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is still in the Chamber, is the responsible Minister. It might be the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin. The redevelopment has already raised €180 million for the ESB through its selling off of half the site. In the middle of a pandemic, it is a deeply cynical move. Moreover, it would be highly ironic for a development of luxury apartments to replace a museum in this city at a time when we are facing a housing crisis and seeing various land deals happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_942"> I want to see Georgian Dublin preserved but I do not want to see the levels of inequality and poverty that defined Georgian Dublin preserved. It would be wrong for the museum to be converted into luxury apartments rather than being kept as a museum for the people. Many schoolchildren benefit from visiting it because it has an educational aspect. It also helps us to promote our city as somewhere interesting to visit. Enough vandalism has been done to Dublin. Its character has, in many ways, been destroyed by development over the years. Perhaps the ESB would use some of its new-found wealth to ensure the museum is preserved. There is a campaign by the Irish Georgian Society to save it. I hope the Minister will back us up in our call to put pressure on the ESB to keep the museum open, in conjunction with the National Museum of Ireland. It is an important educational and heritage facility. We must prevent further vandalism of this nature in our city.</p>

            <p eId="para_943">I thank the Deputy. The ESB began work on Project Fitzwilliam, the redevelopment of the Fitzwilliam Street site, in June 2017. The project involves the construction of two separate grade A office blocks, an underground car park and the redevelopment of the ESB-owned Georgian buildings on Mount Street. The redevelopment will deliver one of the most efficient and sustainable office developments in Dublin city, with a near-zero energy rating, while sensitively respecting and enhancing the Georgian streetscape. The project involves the demolition of some existing buildings, the retention and refurbishment of a number of protected Georgian structures and the construction of a new seven-storey office block. It includes the complete renovation of 11 Georgian houses. The ESB will continue to occupy three of them, with eight houses returning to residential use, comprising 17 residential units. The house at No. 29 Fitzwilliam Street is one of those eight.</p>
            <p eId="para_944"> The ESB proposal comprises converting the museum building back to three residential units for individual and family ownership. The ESB has stated its belief that returning the eight houses to residential use is the most sustainable means of safeguarding the streetscape, which is the most critical heritage aspect of these buildings. The cluster of eight houses has the potential to become an exemplar scheme for Dublin to demonstrate successful city living. It is also delivering a residential scheme that showcases the standards and designs set out in the South Georgian Dublin Townhouse Re-Use guidance document published in March 2019 by Dublin City Council. A cohesive development of this type and scale offers a unique opportunity within the Georgian core. It addresses neighbour anxiety, modern hygiene and convenience standards, as well as building legacy issues, which were identified as key impediments to attracting owner-occupiers to Georgian houses for the Living City initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_945"> The ESB Georgian House Museum at No. 29 Fitzwilliam Street opened to the public in 1991, as the Deputy said, to support Dublin's status as European Capital of Culture in that year. It was never envisaged that the exhibition would run forever. Since 1991, there is a changed landscape in terms of historical and heritage offerings, with many museums and heritage alternatives now available.</p>

          <speech by="#BridSmith" eId="spk_500">
            <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2021-01-28T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_946">The Minister's answer seems to have come from the textbook of the ESB. I have a statement in front of me from the company which says:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_947">Since 1991, there is a changed landscape in terms of historical and heritage offerings, with many museums and heritage alternatives now available. Our commitment to heritage activities is now more closely linked to our corporate responsibilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">The ESB is spelling it out in that statement that its interests are in corporate responsibilities, not in its commitment to the city. When we talk about successful city living, are we actually talking about luxury, high-end apartments? Are we saying that one can only live successfully in this city if one is extremely well off and that it is shut down to ordinary people?</p>
            <p eId="para_949"> Had the ESB kept to its commitment, which was made as part of a deal with Dublin Corporation at the time the company was given permission to flatten the street, the fully furnished and fully refurbished Georgian home, as it stood in the late 1700s and early 1800s, would still be available for all of us to enjoy as visitors. If the ESB takes it away, there is not a single other property in which we can enjoy that historical setting. The company referred in one of its statements to the tenement museum on Henrietta Street. I know that museum very well but comparing it with the Georgian House Museum is not comparing like with like. The tenement museum preserves the inequality of that period of our history. The museum in Fitzwilliam Street preserves the high end of that history and it is worthwhile to be able to contrast the two.</p>
            <p eId="para_950"> The closure of the museum on Fitzwilliam Street is an act of vandalism and an abandonment of the city. Given the privileges the ESB enjoyed to develop the street over the years and the money it has made from selling off chunks of the site, that it would be allowed to walk away from reopening the museum is not acceptable. I call again on the Minister to put pressure on the ESB, a semi-State company, to hold on to the museum and keep it open for the enjoyment and benefit of the people of this country and all who visit it. I ask that it not be allowed to destroy one of the remaining open public spaces that is part of the Georgian architecture of this city.</p>

            <p eId="para_951">This is a critical feature of our heritage and the character of our city. It is an issue that has been deeply controversial going back to the development of the ESB offices some 50 years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">There was rightful controversy. Deputy Smith is right to say that the people protesting at the time were absolutely correct about protecting our Georgian heritage.</p>
            <p eId="para_953"> My sense from passing the site every day is that the architects have done a good job with the new development. It is remarkable but it seems to me that it fits in within the site. We cannot see it fully yet, but it looks like it will be a real enhancement to the city.</p>
            <p eId="para_954"> I believe having people living in Georgian buildings will achieve something. I absolutely agree with Deputy Smith and I commit 100% that we have to work to ensure that our city does not become some place where a person can only be wealthy if he or she lives within it. I believe in the objective of getting people, especially families, to live within our Georgian quarter. I believe the nature of offices, what is happening with Covid-19, the need for reducing office space and the building of significant other office space give us the potential to open up or bring back in families and people to live in our Georgian quarter.</p>
            <p eId="para_955"> In making this call, the ESB has said that these eight units will create more space by dividing them up. If the ESB does succeed in showing an example of how we can get people living back within the Georgian quarter, then I believe it would be a real benefit to our city.</p>
            <p eId="para_956"> This does not take from the argument made by Deputy Smith, which is absolutely correct, about the need to have a mix of different tenancies and to have housing models so that all people of every income and circumstances can live in the city. Anyway, that should not stop us opening up our Georgian houses and using them to get people living in them again. That would be an important and useful legacy and I support the ESB in its approach to try to make that happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_957">I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, for coming in to take this Topical Issue debate. I wish to raise the issue of non-essential work and the Government's lack of strict, clear and proper instructions to employers. Each day, I have people contacting me about being forced to work onsite in an office or warehouse although we are in a critical stage of the pandemic and their work cannot logically or practically be deemed essential. I looked at the traffic when I was driving here this afternoon. It is clear that there are too many people working onsite in Dublin in offices or wherever and there are too many people out on our roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_958"> A constituent was sent to do repair work at a house where all the family had Covid-19, despite the family alerting the man's employer that there was Covid-19 in the house and that he should not come near it. Can the Minister of State imagine being sent to a house where there was Covid and where this fact had been relayed to the employer? I am sure the employer did not do it on purpose or knowingly risk the life of the employee, but it is certainly risk-taking. I am sure it was a mistake but it could have ended up with the man catching Covid-19. I hope the people in that home are okay.</p>
            <p eId="para_959"> Other constituents are worried about the retail and warehousing that cannot and should not be considered essential during a pandemic. A lampshade, a cushion or a lick of paint are not essential when we are dealing with a virus that is out of control.</p>
            <p eId="para_960"> In a pandemic, browsers in non-essential shops are risk-taking. I do not blame them really because they are following the rules. They are not breaking the rules by going to shops that are open. No staff member in these stores should be exposed to this risky behaviour, especially when masks and distancing are not rigorously enforced.</p>
            <p eId="para_961"> A constituent who contacted me previously got on to me again yesterday morning to say that an auxiliary worker had tested positive for the virus after working an eight-hour shift without telling the organisation that the worker was going for a test. This resulted in colleagues being isolated while already at the mercy of exposure to coronavirus. This constituent was also worried about exposure of customers in the shop.</p>
            <p eId="para_962"> Another constituent encountered a first closed building site this week. The person had been going around to different sites and they had all been open. Today was the first day the person came to a building site that was closed. The person had been sent to block wall stage after block wall stage of buildings that are nowhere near completion and where use of masks and distancing are not being enforced. The man believes he is taking his life and the lives of his family in his hands every day. The man has a child who is immunocompromised and he is extremely worried about this. For what and for whom is this?</p>
            <p eId="para_963"> I have written to the Minister for Health and the Tánaiste. I got a response from the Minister for Health today. He says that at level 5 all non-essential retail and all non-essential services must remain closed. Yet, we all know that is not the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_964"> The health of our economy depends on the health of our public and workers. What will the Minister of State do to prevent this unnecessary risk to our workers and customers in the workplace?</p>
            <p eId="para_965"> The cases remain stubbornly high. The figures were released today. We have a further 1,466 new cases. That is a slight increase on yesterday. The UK variant is now in 63% of samples. It is easily transmissible. We really have to enforce it. This lockdown is not as harsh as the first lockdown, but it should be far harsher with the extremes of this virus.</p>

            <p eId="para_966">My thanks to Deputy Cronin for raising the issue. She has touched on several cases. I probably cannot comment on all of them because they are simply examples the Deputy is picking out. I am not familiar with the various stories but I will try to talk in general about the issue. Certainly, we can follow up on specific cases if the Deputy wishes.</p>
            <p eId="para_967"> There are protocols in place and methods to deal with this. The Deputy has raised an array of situations. I am unsure what part of the country the Deputy is referring to so I cannot comment individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_968"> I wish to be clear on this. The Government advice is clear in respect of what we expect under level 5 from employers and various businesses. We are currently in level 5 and we are using the Government living with Covid-19 plan. Within level 5, people should work from home unless it is absolutely necessary to attend in person for the delivery of an essential service, as listed on the Government website. The Government website details what those essential services are. It is not for any individual company to decided where it fits in. There is clear guidance and advice. Most employees who contact us are able to track and follow these. The majority of business owners and employers are working to the protocols, guidance and regulations and, more important, to the spirit of the regulations. There is ongoing conversation when it comes to certain products and what is and is not essential. We have asked all those in the retail community to honour the spirit of what we are trying to do. The spirit of level 5 is to protect people, customers and employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_969"> The reason behind most lockdowns and restrictions is to stop the movement of people so that we can restrict the movement of the virus and reduce the number of close contacts. That is what this is all about in level 5. We have often had the debate in the Chamber when representatives from different sectors say the virus is not in their sectors or here or there. We are trying to restrict the movement of people. That is how we can bring the virus back under control.</p>
            <p eId="para_970"> The Health and Safety Authority has published guidance in conjunction with major stakeholders around work safety protocols, back-to-work safety protocols and the different guidance that applies. The HSA can be consulted by any employee or business that needs guidance. The HSA does not have a role in determining which employees can work from home. Along with other agencies the authority carries out compliance with the work safety protocol inspections. Any essential worker with concerns about health and safety standards at his or her place of work should contact the Health and Safety Authority for detailed advice on the protocol. The authority will respond to that and a good service is provided. The authority has given a good deal of guidance and has carried out numerous inspections. The inspections have been targeted in some cases and announced and unannounced in other cases. Certainly, the HSA will follow up on any queries or concerns that people might raise.</p>
            <p eId="para_971"> It is vital that employers and employees resolve these matters relating to homeworking and the choice to work from home. We had a case recently where the option was not provided for. It is important that these matters are solved locally by mutual dialogue and engagement where possible. In the majority of cases I have dealt with, that has happened and we have seen a responsible decision by the employer or business owner.</p>
            <p eId="para_972"> During the year at different stages of lockdown different employers might have had different views, but over time in recognising the difficulty with public health and the seriousness of this, they have changed their views and have adapted their work practices. The majority of companies that we know of are facilitating people to work from home, work remotely and carry out their services in a safe environment. It is their responsibility to do that by following the guidance and legislation set down.</p>
            <p eId="para_973"> Again, if there are any issues or if it is not possible to have those disputes sorted out by mutual dialogue or common sense, the disputes can be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission for mediation or conciliation.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">The Workplace Relations Commission is providing services both face-to-face and virtually and its information and customer service facility can answer queries from either an employer or an employee. It is happy to do that and has engaged successfully in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_975"> Separately, and to bring this debate further, the Tánaiste recently highlighted the report Making Remote Work, which seeks to make sure that remote working will still be a choice for many after Covid and will be facilitated but, again, in a planned and co-ordinated way. We understand that many people were sent home in March of last year to try to work from home in an unplanned and unco-ordinated way. Our hope is that we will be able to build on the success of that and the trust created in it in order that in the future, we will have a proper remote working strategy. That is what we are trying to do in conjunction with all the stakeholders and legislation will come through the House to reflect that in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_976">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I am forced to disagree with him. I believe the instructions that have been given to employers are a bit lax. Employers seem more intent on finding loopholes, which the Government should be fixing. It is important that we keep our workers safe at this time because our economy just cannot work without our workers' safety. I heard Deputy Doherty ask what planet the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, is living on. I think he is going around with a virtual reality headset on his head because this seems to have been designed by lobby groups rather than public health. The list of people who are considered essential workers is much longer than it was the first time. I am trying to be constructive. We see the Garda checkpoints now on the road. I wonder if there were some way we could identify essential workers and give them passes for their cars, or something in order that they could use a different lane on the motorway, or something like that, so that if they are travelling they could be easily identified. That way, the Government could be very strict and employers would have to apply to the Government to find out whether their work is deemed essential. I can tell the Minister of State straight that appeasing the lobbies is not worth any worker's life or health. We have seen them lobby. They lobby the Opposition as well as the Government. However, a republic should look after the health of its nation and not just the businesses and its government. The people have been amazing during this crisis. We can see that once we stick to the rules the numbers come down. It is therefore not the people who are the problem. The virus is absolutely a problem but the rules are the biggest problem. We have to be stricter about the rules to keep people safe. I ask the Minister of State to consider that.</p>

            <p eId="para_977">I am not sure what the Deputy is trying to get at by taking a swipe at the Tánaiste, my party leader. We have tried at all times to introduce a balance as to how we deal with Covid. At all times it has favoured public health first while protecting people from the threat of the virus, saving as many lives as we possibly can and stopping the spread of the virus. It is also unfair to paint all businesses into one category and to say they are not playing their part. Businesses have taken a major hit over the past year in the response to Covid. Many of the restrictions are on business and trade and therefore on people's jobs as well. I think everybody has played their part. As a taxpayer, I am trying to support those businesses through this difficult time. It is unfair to come in here and generalise. If there are individual cases, I am more than happy to deal with them. We do that. We respond to them. Our agencies have done so as well in a very professional way. In many cases this has resulted in changes to the approach of some businesses, that is, a few businesses. The majority are, without a doubt, playing their part. If the Deputy is aware of cases, I ask her to bring them forward and we can have them looked at but it is wrong of her to make the comments she made. I remind her that many of her party colleagues wanted to keep pubs open only a few months ago, so it should be borne in mind that some of the commentary in here does not always add up and there is not always joined-up thinking. It is wrong to give the impression that anything but public health has come first in this debate for the past year. I am quite conscious that some workers have concerns and we try to deal with them. Many contact my offices and our Department about retail and we deal with that. The Garda and the Department of Justice have been part of that enforcement, and we have called into many retail businesses and passed on the advice and the guidance. That has changed the operations. That is what we do. The regulations and the guidance are there. I disagree with the Deputy that businesses need clearer rules. I think anybody who is capable of running a business can interpret what the rules are and who is essential. We have to be very clear. The level 5 measures set out by the Government were the result of a Government decision taken with stakeholders on the best public health advice as to what is essential. Yes, the advice and the guidance in respect of this level 5 lockdown differ from the advice and the guidance given during the first one in February and March 2020. We were dealing with a brand new virus that we did not know much about. We have learned a great deal over the time since. We have tried to prioritise certain sectors such as manufacturing, education and services for people with special needs. Yes, we have made changes and more traffic will be seen on the roads but it is nowhere near what it would have been in normal times. The restrictions are there.</p>

            <p eId="para_979">The Deputy is right, however, and I will agree with her on this, that it is a matter of all of us following the best advice. That is how we will stop the spread of the virus. It is not a blame game but a matter of all of us adhering to the advice and the guidance as best we possibly can.</p>
