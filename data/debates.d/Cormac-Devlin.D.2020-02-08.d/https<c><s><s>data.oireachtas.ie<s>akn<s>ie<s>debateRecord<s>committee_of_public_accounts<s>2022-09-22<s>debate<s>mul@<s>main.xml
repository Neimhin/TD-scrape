          <p eId="para_9">I welcome everyone to the meeting. Apologies have been received from Deputy Colm Burke. If attending from within the committee room or precincts of Leinster House, attendees are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others against the risk of contracting Covid-19. It is still with us, unfortunately. Members attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of the Parliament. This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is accompanied this morning by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> This morning, in our first engagement of the new Dáil term, we are meeting Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, to examine its 2020 financial statements. We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from HRI: Ms Suzanne Eade, chief executive; Mr. Roger Casey, chief financial officer; Mr. Jason Morris, director of racing and strategic projects; and Ms Claire Rudd, head of risk and compliance. We are also joined by the following officials from the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB: Mr. Darragh O’Loughlin, chief executive, and Mr. Donal O’Shea, head of finance. Finally, we are joined by the following officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine: Mr. Martin Blake, assistant secretary, and Ms Caroline Ball, principal officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off. I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference attendees may make to other persons in their evidence. As witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with such directions. </p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2022-09-22T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_15">As members are aware, Horse Racing Ireland was established to provide a statutory basis for the control, regulation and development of the horse racing industry in Ireland. In addition to its regulatory, funding and development activities, HRI operates a number of racecourses and runs a totaliser betting system. Organisationally, HRI’s activities are delivered through a group structure involving the statutory body and eight subsidiary companies. In addition, HRI has around a one-third shareholding in an associate company called Curragh Racecourse Limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> HRI received State funding of €67.2 million in 2020 from the Vote for agriculture, food and the marine. This accounted for 71% of HRI’s income in the year. Its other main sources of income were contributions from horse owners and sponsors towards racing prize money totalling €16.3 million, sales of media rights to the value of €5 million, registration fee income of €2.2 million and thoroughbred industry contributions of €202,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> HRI incurred a net loss of €904,000 from racing activities in 2020, on turnover of just under €59 million. This outcome was a reversal from the small surplus of €294,000 in 2019, on turnover of just under €73 million. The decline in turnover and the loss incurred reflect the net impact of Covid-19 restrictions on racing and race attendance, and of Covid financial supports provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> HRI had exceptional income of €9.3 million in 2020, mainly arising from the profit on a sale of land in Ballyogan, Dublin, to the Department of Education. The group accounts include a charge of €1 million in relation to a special dividend payment made by HRI to the Exchequer from the sales proceeds, on the instructions of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>
          <p eId="para_19"> On the expenditure side in 2020, HRI incurred costs totalling €86.7 million, including €51.6 million paid out in prize money. Expenditure of €11.9 million was incurred on integrity and racecourse services, mainly comprising grants to the Irish Horse Racing Regulatory Board. Overall, the HRI group recorded a retained surplus of €13.8 million for 2020. The 2020 financial statements received a clear audit opinion. However, without qualifying that opinion, my report drew attention to two matters related to HRI’s activity in the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> First, I drew attention to a loss of €1.8 million incurred in 2020 related to HRI’s investment in Curragh Racecourse Limited. This followed a loss on the same investment of just over €2 million in 2019. HRI’s cumulative loss to end 2020 arising from the investment was €6.4 million, representing almost 28% of the amount invested by HRI in the associate company. HRI recognised an impairment charge of €6.4 million on its investment in the HRI statement of financial position for 2020. </p>
          <p eId="para_21"> Curragh Racecourse Limited is a company established to provide for the redevelopment and management of the Curragh racecourse. The redevelopment involved the construction of a new stand and other racing facilities, which opened in mid-2019. Ownership of the company is split between HRI, the private-membership Turf Club and a consortium of private investors.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> Notes 37 and 39 of the group financial statements explain that HRI had contributed funding to Curragh Racecourse Limited totalling over €36 million up to the end of 2019. This comprised an investment of €23 million in return for a 35.29% economic interest in the company, grant funding of €12.5 million towards the cost of the construction project, the upfront payment of €500,000 for the right to use a hospitality suite at the racecourse for 30 years and a loan of €500,000 given during 2019 to fund additional works on the racecourse’s parade ring.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> Note 39 to the financial statements further discloses that Horse Racing Ireland entered into an agreement in 2020 to provide a convertible loan of up to €9 million to Curragh Racecourse Limited. By 31 December 2020, €6.9 million of the loan facility had been transferred to the company. Under the terms of the loan agreement, any outstanding liability to Horse Racing Ireland on 31 January 2024 will automatically convert to shares in the associate company.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> The second matter to which I drew attention is the disclosure in Note 15 (i) to the financial statements that HRI booked a loss of €105,000 on the disposal of around seven acres of land through a land swap deal undertaken by its subsidiary, the Tipperary Race Company plc. HRI acquired around 12 acres of land adjoining Tipperary racecourse in 2019 at a cost of €25,000 per acre. Part of the land acquired was swapped with a neighbouring landholder, but was now valued at €10,000 an acre. The result was a write-down of around €15,000 an acre in the carrying value for the land disposed of.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Certification of HRI’s 2020 group financial statements was delayed as we awaited further information from HRI on the valuation of the investment in Curragh Racecourse Limited. HRI’s group financial statements were certified by me on 28 April 2022 and we are currently engaged with HRI in the process of final clearance of the financial statements for 2021.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">I thank Mr. McCarthy. Ms Eade is welcome to the meeting. I see from the letter of invitation that she has five minutes to give her opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_4">
          <from> Ms Suzanne Eade<recordedTime time="2022-09-22T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">I am grateful to be given the opportunity to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to assist with the examination of the 2020 financial statements of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI. I am the chief executive of HRI. I am joined by HRI’s chief financial officer, Mr. Roger Casey, director of racing and strategic projects, Mr. Jason Morris, and head of risk and compliance, Ms Claire Rudd.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> As members will be aware, HRI is a commercial semi-State body responsible to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, having been established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001. HRI is responsible for the overall administration, governance, development and promotion of the Irish horse racing industry on an all-island basis. HRI operates a corporate structure that comprises the main body and nine subsidiaries, one of which is dormant. HRI’s functions are set out in legislation. The HRI board comprises a chair and 13 ordinary members who are a mixture of industry and ministerial nominees. HRI’s audit and risk committee is a statutory sub-committee of the board established to assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. The audit and risk committee has its own charter, which outlines its purpose and key responsibilities. This committee meets at least four times annually to fulfil its duties to the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I apologise to the committee for the delay in the submission of HRI’s 2020 financial statements, which was driven by some additional technical clarifications required by the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to the Curragh. This required both external advice and a full sign-off of the Curragh Racecourse 2020 financial statements in advance of clearing the HRI accounts. HRI’s group financial statements for 2021 will be submitted post approval at HRI’s board meeting on 10 October, subject to Comptroller and Auditor General clearance. We have provided the committee with briefing material in relation to the Curragh Racecourse Limited, but we will be happy to address questions members may have on any other matters related to the 2020 accounts or any other aspects of our finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> The horse racing and breeding industries are significant across all of Ireland, producing more than €2 billion in total expenditure annually and supporting approximately 29,000 direct and indirect jobs. Supportive Government policy and legislation have put structures in place that have not only protected this vital industry but have allowed Ireland to compete at the highest level on the world stage, while enabling vital and sustainable rural-based employment throughout the country. HRI and the entire horse racing and breeding industries are very grateful to the Oireachtas for its continued support through the horse and greyhound fund. It means that HRI can promote an industry in which new entrants can thrive, and since 2020 we have seen many new faces. It is heartening to see 52 new trainers having their first winner since 2020 as well as hundreds of new racehorse owners every year. New owners and trainers typically mean more horses in training and our industry figures would back that up. Given the labour-intensive nature of the racing industry and the care horses need, that also means many more racing jobs in rural Ireland. This ensures that breeders all over the country can have a vibrant market for their young horses and only a competitive domestic racing environment, underpinned by appropriate prize money, can ensure that those who have invested at sales to prepare, train and improve young horses will see their investment and skills rewarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> Like many other industries, Covid brought serious challenges to our industry, with racing staged behind closed doors, or with significantly reduced capacities, during 2020 and 2021. However, racecourses weathered the storm supported through Government and HRI schemes and strong media rights income. Together with the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, HRI provided a solution for point-to-point racing in the spring of 2021, allowing it to continue on the racecourse for a period and ensuring that the trade that trickles down to store sales and national hunt breeders continued to flow.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> The industry statistics published in August for the first half of 2022 point to a resilient industry. The number of horses in training is up more than 15% on the last comparable year of 2019. This is a key figure when it comes to assessing total rural employment in the industry. In tandem with that, thousands of people are involved in horse ownership in Ireland, be it on their own or, indeed, the many who enjoy a low-cost racing ownership experience through syndicates or racing clubs. Attendances in the first half of 2022 were down 9%. We must view this dip in attendances through the prism of people being slow to attend crowded events post Covid, as well the current cost-of-living crisis, which has impacted every leisure and sporting arena in the world. That said, racing continues to deliver superb sporting occasions showcasing the best of our industry and sport. Despite these headwinds, a strong racing product here in Ireland continues to be consumed in growing numbers on television and on mobile devices, and there remains strong domestic and international confidence in the Irish thoroughbred, with bloodstock sales through public auction up 31% on 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> I welcome the appointment of Ms Anne Marie Caulfied as the new CEO designate of the gambling regulatory authority of Ireland. HRI, through its industry education and training department, Equuip, has long supported the funding of addiction services and the setting up of a gambling regulator in Ireland is very welcome. I look forward to working with the authority once it is fully operational.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> Away from the racetrack, HRI has a number of strategic priorities, including equine welfare and sustainability. HRI has been instrumental in creating a business environment centred on the pre-eminent Irish-bred horse. The headlines of successes worldwide are underpinned by vigilance around care from people who are in contact with the horses on a daily basis and prioritise their care and welfare. The daily care of horses is the cornerstone of our horse welfare strategy of verifiable high standards of care for our population of horses. Included in these are improved traceability systems, such as the electronic passport issued to the 2021 foal crop and all subsequent crops, the welfare standards checklist published recently and safety nets supported by HRI, including the Treo Eile platform for retired racehorses.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> We are very conscious of our responsibility under the Government’s climate action plan and we are very well advanced on a sustainability strategy for the organisation and for the wider breeding and racing industry. Over the past couple of months, we have engaged with our stakeholders and held focus groups with industry organisations and can report a huge sustainability ambition within racing and breeding. Our role is to lead by example as an advocate and champion of sustainability and to help the breeding and racing industry to increase its understanding of our responsibilities in this area, through education, increased awareness and financial supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> I thank members for the invitation to discuss HRI’s 2020 accounts. We look forward to taking their questions on any other matters concerning the racing and breeding industry in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">I thank all our guests for being here. I want to get some further clarification regarding the delay in submission of the financial statements.

          <p eId="para_57">Certainly, we obviously try to complete an audit and get the certificate to everybody as soon as possible. Once the accounts have been signed off on, there is an obligation to have them submitted – within three months is the standard – to the Oireachtas Library so they will be available to the committee. There was a bit of a delay, I think, over the summer in the submission of the audited accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> The point of draft unaudited accounts going to the Department is that the Department will be aware of the broad financial position of a State body at the earliest possible time. It is obviously subject to confirmation by the audit process. The delay we had was in relation to the accounting for the investment in Curragh Racecourse Limited. The loss, I think, was recognised in the draft financial statements. That information would have been available to the Department from the draft but we were not happy that it was properly accounted for. The technical advice had to be received by HRI to complete that process.</p>

It was established by the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee in 2018 in order to stand independent of the clubs so as to perform the regulatory functions in Irish horse racing.

          <p eId="para_97">Does Mr. Blake not accept that we are now in a convoluted situation? HRI is providing convertible loans that may in turn be converted into shares, which, according to the accounts we have seen, is likely to be the case. There is an exemption in relation to freedom of information requests because of the structure that has been put in place. Since that time, has either the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform carried out an analysis of whether mistakes have been made in terms of how the Curragh Racecourse was approached?</p>

          <p eId="para_162"> To go back to the disposal of lands, will Ms Eade explain that to the committee? On paper, this looks like another case of poor judgment.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">To be perfectly honest, it looks worse than it actually is in reality. Let me talk the Deputy through the process. We purchased a big portion of land, which is to do with the development in relation to Tipperary. At the onset, we knew that part of the process would require us to do a swap of some of that land to get the land that would allow us to widen the track. For us, this is of real strategic value. Also, when we went to do the swap, it was not really of high interest to the seller to do anything in particular in relation to the swap. We wanted that land for our overall development and it is of strategic high value to us to get that land. What happened was there was a book loss of €105,000 in relation to that project, in relation to the land itself, but there was no cash loss to HRI. That land is more important to us than it was. Where we probably got the oversight wrong is that we looked at the project as a swap and we did not look at it as a disposal and an acquisition. That is where we got it wrong. However, that land is worth more to us than what we gave away.</p>

          <p eId="para_189">I ask Ms Eade to give us an understanding of the distribution. How was the €50 million paid in prize money for 2020 distributed? That would give us a bit of transparency on the use of Exchequer funds to fund prize money. It is difficult to process why we are using Exchequer funds and taxpayer money to fund the top five trainers in the industry. We need some visibility on that a rationale for it. We need information on how this is being distributed and improved over time.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">In general terms, of some 4,900 owners, 3,600 won prize money. While the top trainers, owners and jockeys will earn more, it is spread among a large portion of those participating in the sport. We have high minimum values for our races in Ireland when compared with Britain. Our minimum value is €10,000, so we are conscious that our strap line is "Growing the grass roots, Winning the world over". That is the dual objective of our prize money strategy. We seek to ensure we continue to succeed internationally while, at the same time, growing the grassroots and helping those at the lower ranks that face challenges against some dominant stables.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">Equine welfare is at the core of everything the IHRB does in relation to integrity. We have a team of vets on our staff and no racing event, point-to-point, flat jump race, flat race or jump race occurs without IHRB vets being on site. Our vets are there to check the welfare of the horses before the race starts. They watch the race and they check the horses again after the race. Horses are trotted up and down to ensure they are not running lame. Even our equine anti-doping regime is designed with the welfare of the horse in mind. We are looking for prohibited substances at all times but we are also looking for the inappropriate use of other medication because no horse should be medicated, other than entirely appropriately and by a veterinary surgeon who is involved in the care and treatment of that horse.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> When we receive concerns, as we sometimes do, about the condition of a particular horse or group of horses in a location, such as on a premises or in a field, if that information comes into us, as it frequently does, our veterinary officers treat that as the highest priority on the day. They drop what they are doing and go out and check on the horses. If the concerns prove to be justified, and unfortunately they sometimes are, we make immediate contact with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We have officers who are authorised under the Animal Remedies Act 1993 and under animal welfare legislation. The Department then comes in and assists and participates closely if there are prosecutions to be brought in respect of the treatment of animals and it takes care of same. If there are rule breaches in the treatment or medication of animals or breaches under the rules of racing, we send those to referrals committees and impose sanctions.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">With regard to every adverse analytical finding and every case where we detected inappropriate use of a medicine in 2021 and in 2022 so far, whether that is a substance that is prohibited at all times or a medicine that should not have been in the horse on race day, all bar two of those have already come to hearing with sanctions handed down.

While cases are still in process and in that space between an adverse analytical finding and the committee finding a breach and handing down a sanction, that is essentially closed because we have to treat people as innocent until we have found them to have breached rules.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">It is a big industry and attendances show the health of an industry. I know people will view a race meeting on television and so on but attendances will tell us something and we can monitor performance on the back of that. The ex-CEO Brian Kavanagh is now CEO of the Curragh Racecourse. Ms Eade may have responded to some of this already. Could she set out a timeline for Mr. Kavanagh's departure? Does she have that available?</p>

          <p eId="para_218">If I look at the process, the appointment of the CEO for Curragh Racecourse Limited was a matter for the Curragh Racecourse Limited board.

That recommendation then came to the HRI board in June 2021 and was approved but HRI or the Department would not have been involved in the recruitment process or appointment.</p>

          <p eId="para_226">To be honest, when I look back on the process, what we were doing was carrying out a post-appraisal of the project and the development. HRI had an evaluation team looking at the project and the development costs. HRI also put in a sub-committee of the board to evaluate the performance of the development. We could see that the project was costing more and having worked through the development, that there were losses accruing. It would have been through the sub-committee and the chair of HRI that we went out and said we felt that more funding was required. We would have instigated it to get funding from all the other parties so we drove the funding.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">The Curragh definitely had to be updated. It had seen no development since 1962 and had become uninsurable. When people look at it now, they need to look beyond the racecourse. It is a magnificent training facility as well for lots of trainers around the country, particularly those around the Curragh. Hundreds of horses are using this track every day. There are 80 miles of turf peat in all-weather gallops across 1,500 acres. It really is a strategic asset for Ireland. I know it is not performing financially the way we all want it to but it is important. It is the first time we have had a facility for flat racing to which we could comfortably welcome international visitors and consumers now have somewhere where they can go. It had a really tough start. Operating during development was a challenge. The opening in 2019 probably did not showcase it at its best. We had two years of Covid and now it is starting again. It has been tough. I am very interested in the commercial performance of the Curragh. I want it to improve. I wanted to see an increase in attendances. Things have been tried this year, some of which have worked while others have not. I will be all about bringing back the spirit to the Curragh because without that spirit, it is not what we want it to be.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">I represent north Kildare, not south Kildare where the Curragh is located, but I am very familiar with the racecourse, some of the facilities adjacent to it and the importance of the equine sector to the county. It is important that it succeeds. I just wanted to get some sense of what this interaction was and why it was necessary. Has all this money been drawn down at this stage?</p>

          <p eId="para_232">No, I do not think so. We must look at the amount of private investment that went into this as well. There was €47 million from other investors plus another significant investment by another individual into the gallops themselves. We have definitely learned lessons for projects going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">We have applied those to our capital guidelines and we have applied them in particular to the work we are doing on Tipperary racecourse. There has also been a lot of good work done in the Curragh that is probably not very evident to people just yet. I hope they will start to see that by next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">That is fine. Effectively, what happened here was that we are hoping to redevelop the Tipperary course into an all-weather track. There were parcels of lands we wanted to procure. At the same time, we knew we would have to procure some and then swap some to get the width of the racetrack we desired. We acquired the first piece of land and then we got into a negotiation with another seller to swap that land. When we did that, we swapped at a deemed lower value than we had paid for the land. The land we had purchased was made up of-----</p>

          <p eId="para_288">My first question is for Mr. O'Loughlin and it is on CCTV footage. Horse Racing Ireland announced on its website in 2017 that CCTV was to be installed. The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board diverted the funding in 2018. Last November, Mr. O'Loughlin told the committee that it would be done at the end of the year. In April, he said it would be done mid-autumn. We have received a response today that is detailed but extremely vague. Will Mr. O'Loughlin explain what first fixing is?</p>

          <p eId="para_289">It is the electrical and wiring work required. It is everything up to attaching the cameras. I acknowledge that the time lines the project has followed have not been the timelines the committee received a year ago. This is something that is deeply frustrating for all of us in the IHRB also. The procurement process commenced last winter. It took a couple of months, as these processes do. Then there was a legal challenge, or legal correspondence, from one of the unsuccessful bidders which delayed things further. Once the project got under way, we started making very good progress. There were some unanticipated delays at many racecourses. We now have cameras being put up in the stables at two racecourses. At another four racecourses all of the electrical work is complete and we are ready to hang cameras. We have first-fix electrical work in progress in another four racecourses. What we had not anticipated at the start of the project was that courses would require civil works, ground works and ducting. Some of the stable yards did not have electricity. The system will not work without adequate electricity. We had to put that in.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">People would be forgiven for having the impression that there is reluctance given the delay to have CCTV installed. Will Mr. O'Loughlin accept that? People might think that with a delay of five years. When I say there has been one excuse after another it speaks for itself. Dates have constantly been given. Mr. O'Loughlin said there is ducting to be done. In any job there is work to be done in advance. There was no preplanning. Every time we asked the date was put back. Either there is a question about competency or the situation is being purposely frustrated. What would Mr. O'Loughlin say to this? Does he accept that might be the perception? In fairness, people would imagine with various scandals and reports of malpractice that the body would be keen to get CCTV fitted as soon as possible and that it would want to protect the integrity of the sport. Outsiders would imagine that it would be the first thing to be made a priority. Five years on, we are still speaking about having only two cameras.</p>

          <p eId="para_364">I want to address two issues. I may be wrong, but there will be a video record of the meeting. Earlier, I asked Ms Eade about the loss on paper, as we call it, relating to the lands in Tipperary. She said that the Department had signed off, but Mr. Blake told my colleague that the Department did not even have notice of that. Somebody needs to correct that. Mr. Blake said that he did not know about it until it had occurred, but Ms Eade said that the Department had signed off on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">I will address this. The Department sanctioned the original purchase and that would have been before Mr. Blake's time. They were notified of the swap but we did not ask for the appropriate level of approval. That is our understanding now.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">Okay. This is to rectify that because people are watching and it will be brought to our attention. My other question relates to Ms Eade's comment that she had gotten one valuation. The committee has had experience of this where public funds are being expended in any area, regardless of whether it is a swap or not, that there would have been more than one valuation. I would have expected this from the Department. Maybe I am wrong but I ask Mr. Blake whether it would have been prudent for the Department to get its own valuation. How does it verify that the valuation is appropriate?</p>

          <p eId="para_370">Yes. Does Mr. Blake not feel that it would be more pertinent in the Department's defence against anything arising such as this, albeit that it is on paper, and that it would be covered from the point of view of looking after the public purse by getting its own valuation? I know that would involve expending a certain amount but at the same time, it is a matter of transparency, accountability and ensuring that public funds are spent properly.</p>

        <speech by="#VeronaMurphy" eId="spk_332">

          <p eId="para_374">It would depend on where the land was, but I appreciate that it is in Tipperary. All Wexford land is probably worth approximately €30,000 per acre. I still think, however, that there has to be a better system. This could be a complete disaster. It could be cost a lot more money. From previous experience, in purchases by different entities, for instance, in the education sector, we all recommended that there should be more than one valuation. That is something to bear in mind going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> Mr. O'Loughlin is new to IHRB and I will have a certain level of forgiveness for him, but I have to agree with my colleague. I come from a county where and horse sport epitomises rural Ireland. It is the biggest part of it. The integrity of the sector is what drives it. I acknowledge that the tender process is a slow process, but we are approximately five years behind. This has all been said, but I expect that this time next year the 25 racecourses will be up and running with cameras. I do not want to have another scandal reported in the sector because the IHRB has not carried out its function. I will put that on Mr. O'Loughlin for next year. That is the timeline he is getting from me as a member of the Committee on Public Accounts. There should not be only two racecourses done. The last time we heard from the IHRB, there were still two, if not one. That is still not progress. I appreciate that while the first fix may be done, I want the final fix to be done in 12 months because that is value for money for the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> The other issue I want to raise I have raised previously. This sector is suffering greatly in respect of insurance costs. I asked Ms Eade's predecessor, who told me that he had made representations to different Departments regarding the insurance difficulties. Whilst this may not be the remit of HRI, I believe that it should be. If the sector does not survive, HRI will have no function. At the moment the industry is under such serious pressure securing insurance cover, particularly for point-to-point meetings. I want proof that there have been representations from HRI. I want to see who it is has written to, what the response was and the efforts it is making so that that sector survives and so that HRI's funding is worthwhile. It is paramount to the continuation of the sector, particularly in rural Ireland. A stakeholder group should be set up within HRI to look after these issues. I say this because it is not getting better, but worse. The sector is not functioning correctly without it.</p>

That is a financial calamity if anyone buys property or land and sells it within two years but achieved a price or a value of one third of the original cost.

          <p eId="para_418">I have asked the question. A few issues stand out. First, there was an old or outdated valuation; second, there was no second valuation; third, the land cost almost €30,000 an acre; fourth, 7 acres of land were swopped for only €10,000, which is almost one third of the original price of an acre; fifth, all this happened at the same time as land prices increased; and, sixth, there is location.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> I do not know the exact location and I have not stood in the field but I am trying to draw a mental picture of it. Land adjacent to transport hubs has huge potential, particularly given Government policy, which correctly targets high-density developments, although sometimes too high for my liking, close to transport hubs. Ms Eades will be aware aware that there is a housing shortage and that the land is in close proximity to the third largest city in the State. Given those factors, does she not think that the outcome is awful in view of the use made of public moneys? Does she agree that there has not been a good outcome?</p>

We have 14 tracks where we are ready to install cameras and I hope to see those done very soon. We have four more where the electrical first fix is in progress and I anticipate getting those cameras up. There are 14 tracks that are ready for cameras, and another four tracks that are currently under way where we can have some visibility on a finish date. I would like to see all of that work done by the end of this year. I will not make any commitments regarding the last five because there are circumstances outside our control.</p>

          <p eId="para_478"> As a regular race attender, I know 2020 was a challenging year with Covid. I would like to address Ms Eade first regarding attendances at the Curragh Racecourse and its profitability. Significant money was expended renovating the course. They have been challenged to bring in crowds there. Ticket price has been identified as one major concern as well as the connectivity to the course. I understand 2020 was is a skewed year for profitability because we had lockdowns during the pandemic. Could Ms Eade or another HRI representative give me some insight into that?</p>

          <from> Ms Suzanne Eade<recordedTime time="2022-09-22T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_479">Obviously, 2020 and 2021 were tough in terms of attendances. However, one of the stronger points for racecourses during that period was the strength of the media rights, particularly streaming. When Ireland was the only team in town racing, that was very good for our racecourses, which upped their streaming. Apart from that, the Curragh management have been strong in reducing costs. They really went after that in the past year or two.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> What concerns me for the Curragh and all racecourses going into the future is the cost of living and the cost of putting on the lights, heating and all that stuff. That will be a big drain as we approach 2023. The big hit for the Curragh at the moment is the depreciation, which is more than €4 million annually. They will have to get much more income other than racecourse attendances to fill that gap. This year they made a cash profit. Depending, again, on the fuel crisis for the remainder of the year, I would expect that they will hit their committed budget in 2022. As I said, I am concerned about the impact on the racecourse's energy bills next year, as I am for every racecourse.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">On attendances again, it is very hard. Some racecourses have done very well around their festivals. The Curragh went through a few years where it lost its connection, perhaps, with their fans. That is something management will have to work hard on going into 2023. They tried different things in 2022, such as with ticket prices, offerings, weekends in August and giving lots of tickets to people in the area to welcome them back. They will have to invest to grow back those attendances next year. HRI will definitely be there to help it get that back.</p>

          <p eId="para_483">It is a shame given the funding that has been invested in that course. The overall cost of the project came in at more than the cost of the renovation of Longchamps. It was a significant investment and that needs to be looked at immediately and some solution found. I have a huge concern about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> Connectivity is an issue as well. Investment in public transport is key. The racecourse sits on the Cork-Dublin line, which is one of the busiest train lines in the country. It would be good to adopt an approach to that. Has HRI tried to attract an Irish Rail service? That would be significant.</p>

          <p eId="para_486"> The Deputy mentioned Longchamps. When it started out, the project was mooted to be €108 million. It actually came in at approximately t €140 in terms of a total redevelopment of Longchamps. When Ascot was rebuilt in the early 2000s, it came in at £220 million.

          <p eId="para_503">Deputy Murphy touched on a serious issue. I am involved in point-to-point racing and disclosing that is important. The insurance costs in that are frightening. Different bodies within racing look after each aspect of it, but there is a collective need to seriously examine that problem. I am getting many calls from point-to-point committees, not only from within my constituency. There is a long affinity with racing in Cork East. In fact, the steeplechase originated in Doneraile in my constituency. What the committees are telling me is a huge concern. Many of them are worried about folding. Point-to-point committees have been impacted already. That has a knock-on impact for small breeders in particular. Racing is a valuable industry with many major players who have a lot of money. However, for smaller breeders involved in racing, of which there are hundreds of in my constituency, that is a huge concern. They want to put horses into training with local trainers. It keeps an ecosystem going. I know I am preaching almost to the converted. However, there is an aspect of concern when it comes to insurance that they have been left out on a limb and that has to be conveyed. We are all aware that there has been difficult litigation taken against some clubs.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">That is a concern of mine. We could do a lot more to support that particular facet of the industry. If Mr. O'Loughlin and Ms Eade have anything to say in response that, I would appreciate it. </p>

          <p eId="para_505">We recognise that insurance for point-to-point is a real difficulty. Insurance costs across the economy have increased but insurance costs for point-to-point and local hunts have soared. We work closely with hunts to ensure they can get insurance. It is not our role to provide insurance for them but whether it concerns local hunts running point-to-points or ensuring jockeys can get insurance, we interact with insurers and help to define the risk and set out for insurers to understand the risk and the extent to which our integrity services are mitigating that risk. We do what we can to support the hunts and other participants to get their insurance. Ms Eade might want to talk more about the financial support HRI has provided to ensure that insurance can be put in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">We support point-to-points through their grants and prize money in HRI. Deputy Catherine Murphy recommended that we get a taskforce together on insurance matters, which is probably a bit overdue, because it is not just about point-to-point. We are seeing insurance providers being very selective about what they will insure across a range of areas that need to be insured and charging us more. Premiums and the excesses are going up. We are all having a tough time with insurance so we need support and a bit more competition in the market. We can only go to so many underwriters. Many of the underwriters for racing have been based in the UK and are now saying that as a result of Brexit, they do not need that risk in their profile anymore so that is a major issue for us.</p>

          <p eId="para_562">I might add something in this regard. Non-disclosure agreements are an absolute standard feature of settlements that are made around termination of employment or the ending of employment. We have seen this in other organisations as well. I have reported previously on severance deals and the use of NDAs. An NDA will typically be phrased in such a way that if there is a statutory obligation to disclose, that disclosure can be done, but for disclosures other than within a statutory structure like, for instance, the presentation of annual financial statements, there may be a difficulty around it. As the chief executive has said, we are looking at this in the context of the 2021 financial audit. I have not determined yet whether I will draw attention to any matter in regard to it or disclose anything.</p>

          <p eId="para_595"> A local issue raised on numerous occasions in Cork was the cancellation of point-to-point races at Kinsale. The IHRB ruled that point-to-point racing would not go into June. I do not know why that was advanced by the organisation. From a national hunt point of view, there is a mixed meeting in Galway in the summer. The point-to-point races at Kinsale were popular and many people in the racing industry, at grassroots level, loved going there. The event just seemed to be pulled and it is important to get an explanation for this. I ask the witnesses to comment.</p>

          <p eId="para_596">The point-to-point season, as defined, begins in October and concludes at the end of May. The season is significantly longer now than it was a couple of years ago, with a finite number of fixtures and ,therefore, the decision taken by the national hunt stewards was that the season should conclude at the end of May because to drag it out any longer would mean stretching the season and the people involved. Without the additional fixtures, there was not much extra benefit. Unfortunately, the bank holiday weekend in June falls after the end of May and, by definition, outside of the season as it is defined. My understanding, however, is that the organisers of that event in Kinsale were offered weekends in May when those races could be held and would be supported. Unfortunately, every sport has an end date on its season. We have even seen the GAA shortening the football and hurling seasons. Once a season has ended, no more fixtures can take place. There is additional risk involved in this case because the ground tends to get drier as the year progresses. Additional costs are also associated with watering that regard. For various reasons, therefore, the season is fixed-----</p>

          <p eId="para_597">Mr. O'Loughlin should not worry; I am well in tune with this. I will not lie, however, as I do not necessarily agree. This is an issue. There is a need to engage with the point-to-point committee in Kinsale on this matter, because it is a bone of contention. Perhaps with costs, going into that time of year, there may be an issue with getting stewards, etc. I do not know but several issues have been raised with me in this context. Traditionally, this event was the final fixture of the season. I appreciate the insight and I will finish on this point.</p>

The process is that the board makes an application to the Department for approval to move forward with the appointment with a suggested salary scale. We would have gone through that and discussed it with DPER in the context of the actual value that was proposed. We agreed to it on the basis that it was not out of line with comparable organisations.</p>

That is standard for many health bodies, but it is not the conventional accounting treatment and therefore it is a qualified opinion in that respect. Second is Science Foundation Ireland for 2021, which has a clear audit opinion. Third is Rasaíocht Con Éireann group accounts for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion.

          <p eId="para_724">The Comptroller and Auditor General’s office and the Committee of Public Accounts keep an eye on all that. As usual, accounts and financial statements will be published on the committee’s web page as part of our minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> The third item is correspondence. As previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in according to proposed actions that have been circulated. Decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the meeting and published on the web page. The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is B, which is correspondence from accounting officers and their Minister of the committee. A number of items were held over from last week for this week’s meeting, because the member who had raised it was not present etc. The first three items relate to the closure of the Benefacts database. I propose that we take them together. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> Item R1378 is from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It is dated 26 July 2022 and it provides information that had been requested by the committee regarding the public funding of Benefacts. The second item of correspondence is R1403 and is from Mr. Pádraig Dalton, director general of the CSO, dated 26 July and also regarding Benefacts. It says to provide a substitute for the database Benefacts provided to the CSO the director general tentatively estimates a cost of €500,000 per year for staff plus technology investment in the first one or two years of approximately €200,000 to €250,000 with ongoing hardware and software costs. However, the director general states that such investment is not likely given that there are other initiatives in train, although those initiatives will not provide all the data that the CSO will require to meet EU legislation. That data that had been available on Benefacts, is obviously lost. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has stated that it has engaged with a number of Departments regarding the data provided by Benefacts. It is not clear if it engaged with the CSO, which appears to have relied heavily on the data and information from the Benefacts research, and we can see this in their document. Members will also want to be made aware that a further related item from the Department of Rural and Community Development has been received and is due to be considered at next week’s meeting.</p>

          <p eId="para_728">We have one more item to go through first. The other item is from Deputy Catherine Murphy, which includes a related proposal. She can speak to that item, which is number R1367. She flagged it for discussion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_669">

          <p eId="para_729">We were given assurances that there was no interest in all relevant Departments, and I do not know if the CSO was contacted in relation to the continuation of Benefacts. That is pretty much my recollection of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> The CSO's response shows that there is a sizeable cost in replicating what had been available in Benefacts. It would involve setting it up again where there was something already there. I do not know if we will send that to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of if it is aware of it. If we had not sent it to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform already, I think we should do that. The Department is saying in correspondence 1378 that, "As the Committee will be aware, most of the relevant data published by Benefacts is available to public bodies as open data from other official bodies." However, the whole idea of Benefacts that was it actually amalgamated that data. That is where the real benefits of Benefacts was. It is infuriating to read that and to know that the likes of the CSO are likely to have to duplicate the work. The other issue highlighted in the CSO’s response is that, "Work planned by the Department of Community and Rural Affairs on social enterprises data collection could be a partial replacement data source, as would data held by the Charities Regulator. However, these data sources would not cover all of the detail". That is the point. We are here to talk about value for money. Something was working, it was closed down, it now has to be replicated and there will be a cost across a range of different Departments. That seems to me to be the very opposite of value for money. In relation to correspondence R1367, I have requested consideration of documents from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I am asking the committee to seek those documents from the Department that I have referenced. It is in the context of this same range of issues. That is my ask in that piece of correspondence.</p>

          <p eId="para_731">I thank the Deputy for that. I was looking at the correspondence from the CSO last night, which raises a number of issues. It states clearly that a significant source of information and data for the national accounts and statistics had greatly improved the quality of information on the non-profit sector that had been included in these results. It goes on to say that, in general, compilers of official statistics have always found this sector difficult to measure, given its diversity. Yet, Benefacts was doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">Going further, we reach the point the Deputy alluded to. The letter says: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_733">Work planned by the Department of Community and Rural Affairs on social enterprises data collection could be a partial replacement data source, as would data held by the Charities Regulator. However, these data sources would not cover all of the detail (i.e. the variables/ items of information about each entity) available in Benefacts.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">From my memory of previous correspondence on this issue - and members of the committee might correct me on this - there was a figure of €6 million over six years. Funding for this was less than €1 million a year. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, which is the gold-standard body for dealing with these matters, very much depended on this for some information. I am at a loss as to what happened here with Benefacts. It is deeply concerning. Is there something we do not know? When we have the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before us, we need it to explain this.</p>

          <p eId="para_739">A report was carried out by Indecon. It very clearly said that, if this was going to be replaced, there should be an interim measure in place because this information is required for good governance. The CSO is very fussy about its information and rightly so. Some of the statistics in respect of the Garda have even been put under qualification because there are concerns as to their reliability. For the CSO to find this to be of such value really reinforces the need for it. A partial replacement is not enough. We should have an actual replacement or we should reconsider bringing it back. An unpopulated database is obviously of no value because there are no datasets. There would be quite a lot of work involved in repopulating if it were to be brought back but the platform is there to do it.</p>

The next item of correspondence is No. 1410B from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It is dated 25 August 2022 and provides information requested by the committee on the digitising of records of the Irish Land Commission. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Catherine Murphy has flagged this item for discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_743">The Minister has agreed that access to these records is in the public interest but they are fragile and require digitisation. They are a real treasure trove. It was announced by the Department that there was going to be a move towards providing some access to them. It has moved on a little bit in that the Department is engaging with the National Archives, which was a great deal of expertise in this area, but it may not have capacity given the extent of the records held. Even the pre-1922 records would be of enormous historical significance and help. It is a useful response but, while it says that it is in the public interest for these records to be made available, it is not entirely clear as to how that is to happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">It has not been decided.

          <p eId="para_745">It would be quite useful if the Department would give us an update when there is a change in this regard. I completely accept that these documents are fragile and that digitising them is a great way to allow people to use them without damaging them.</p>

          <p eId="para_746">They are stored in a building in Portlaoise at the moment. We hope that they are in safe keeping. One of the particularly important issues that is coming up is the issue of bog plots, that is, turf plots on bogs. They are recorded on many of these documents. A lot of the original turbary rights and the folios recording them derive from the division of the old estates through the Irish Land Commission. Information on these matters is contained in those documents. In a couple of cases I have dealt with over the years, that was the only place this information could be found. It is important.</p>

          <p eId="para_747">There is obviously a good bit of work going on in the National Archives. The letter references the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland. I have been there on numerous occasions. I have toured this modern facility. It used to be in a terrible state when it was in a different location but it is now down in the Titanic Quarter.

          <p eId="para_750">That would be great. The next item of correspondence is No. 1426B from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 31 August 2022 and providing information requested by the committee regarding the status of the business case for the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital. Deputy Munster has flagged this for discussion. If the committee is agreeable, I will hold it back until next week. We have done that on a few occasions. The Deputy asked that I hold it back until next week if the committee is agreeable. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> We will move on to No. 1428B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 31 August 2022 and providing information requested by the committee regarding the national broadband plan. It is not proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence which may be relevant to our forthcoming meeting with the Department on 13 October. Is that agreed? Agreed. It was flagged by Deputy Carthy but he is not online. There is a substantial body of information included in the documents that came with this letter. It is something we need to keep a close eye on because, as members will see in the documents, although a member of National Broadband Ireland, NBI, yesterday assured me that it has made great progress in the last week-----</p>

A photograph of me was taken while I was being told this so I told the photographer to make sure a caption was put under it to explain that I was arguing with the NBI official about the low level of take-up and the fact that only 15,000 premises were connected. I have great concerns about this. We have got involved in this scheme and it seems that, where the national broadband plan network is being rolled out, people are saying that they are okay and have a good service with another provider already. By any standards, this level of uptake, 23%, is very low. I know it is early days-----</p>

The current target is for 102,000 premises to be passed by the end of January 2023. That was originally supposed to be passed by January 2022 but that did not happen. The schools programme is going reasonably well. Some 679 schools are connected. There are also 284 community connection points. It is good that is happening. It will allow people to work remotely from different locations. However, with regard to homes, premises and farms being connected, the numbers are very small by any standard. It is an issue we need to talk to NBI about when we have it in again. Either the marketing of the service is not good or people are just saying "We are fine, thank you very much. I already have good wireless broadband and I am happy enough with it." I do not know which is happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_780">We will move on. The next item is No. 1431B from Mr. Peter Reynolds, chief financial officer of Trinity College, dated 1 September 2022 and providing information we requested regarding non-compliant procurement. The committee has a standing agreement to follow up on and request explanations from bodies that are accountable to it where the Comptroller and Auditor General identifies non-compliant procurement in excess of €500,000 in their accounts. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> I have flagged this because there were a few things that stood out to me. As can be seen in the correspondence, 13 vendor or supplier payments were listed as non-compliant. Members can see the table included in the document along with the total figure. PricewaterhouseCoopers received €79,900, almost €80,000, for taxation advice to support overseas offices. A tender solution is being examined with HR for the 2022 financial year. I am curious as to why tax advice would not have been tendered for given the number of accountancy firms in the city, never mind in the State. The university is saying that a tender solution is being examined. We should write back and say that this needs to be a tendered process. Going down through these non-compliant payments, it can be seen that, in respect of the second one, there are no repeat purchases planned and that the awards are now being tendered for. That is fine. The fourth relates to consultancy. No repeat purchase is planned. I have flagged another in respect of pensions. Some €434,941 was spent on pension administration fees. The expenditure was not assessed due to the designation of overall pensions spend as exempt. The contract is now tendered. Does the Comptroller and Auditor General wish to explain that? I take it to mean that the university is saying, because the overall pension spend is exempt from procurement, the contract does not have to be tendered for. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_783">That seemed to be an unusual explanation. Do any members wish to come in on any of that? I ask for the agreement of the committee to correspond with Mr. Reynolds and to explain that the committee wishes to have a tendered solution for the taxation advice to support overseas offices. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> There is an issue with education and training boards, ETBs, and non-compliant procurement. We may wish to consider this and address other issues that are arising. A number of the items of correspondence on today's list provide explanations for non-compliant procurement. Seven of those are from ETBs and there are a number of recurring themes within them. Members will have seen this over recent years. The first reason being given for why individual ETBs are not able to properly carry out procurement is that there are difficulties in securing staff for procurement-specific roles. Another is aggregate spend leading to breaches. A number of ETBs state that this happens on local sites within an ETB area. These procure separately but, when the spend is added up for the ETB, it can lead to breaches of the national threshold of €25,000. By way of example, it is noted that Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB has over 90 sites. If each reached the €25,000 mark, the overall spend would reach €2.3 million. I calculated that figure quickly this morning. Contract roll-over is another recurring theme and inadequate financial systems are also mentioned. </p>
          <p eId="para_785"> No. R1437 from the City of Dublin ETB gives a good overview of some of the issues. We will note and publish the rest. I am open to suggestions but it might also be worth bringing these items of correspondence to the attention of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Office of Government Procurement, although you would hope they are actively working on them. There is an issue with regard to the threshold and calculating costs over different sites. Each site can go up to that figure. I know that Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB is the biggest with 90 sites. A lot of non-compliant procurement could accumulate across these. Is it agreed that we bring this to the attention of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Office of Government Procurement? Agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_799">The next item is No. 1434B, from Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. It is dated 1 September 2022 and provides a summary of the report requested by the committee regarding climate action plan targets that was undertaken by McKinsey &amp; Company.

          <p eId="para_800"> I have flagged this item of correspondence because the figures in it are out of this world. Members will see that there are figures in the first section of the document. It goes into the cost of delivering on a pathway and states that major investment of €119 billion is required by 2030, focused on electricity at €36 billion, transport at €42 billion and upgrading of buildings at €31 billion. The document goes on to state that the alternative scenario is reduced ambitions in agriculture, resulting in a higher total economy cost. I just thought that the figures were very high. I know that there is private sector investment and, obviously, public investment, but the document really sets out the challenge economically in meeting this. It does, however, go on to outline that there are some positive signs as to what is happening in other countries in that maybe they are a bit ahead of us in terms of the cost of solar decreasing, for example, and other developments happening there. I just think that in the next eight years we face into significant challenges. Does any Member wish to comment on this?</p>

          <p eId="para_811"> I have flagged this item. There are some explanations, as Members will see in the correspondence, of some of the reasons given to us in respect of specialised services and tenders having been undertaken in other cases for technical services and projects. On medical and surgical consumables there was expenditure of €281,000. It is stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_812"> The underlying products and supplies are of a specialized and patient specific nature. CHI continues to work itself and also closely with the HSE in an effort to ensure that all such supplies may be secured in a compliant manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">There is an awful lot of stuff in the correspondence. I suppose that with medical matters we can understand that some of that will be specialised and that there may be only the one company supplying it, but this is one we need to keep an eye on because there are significant examples here of tendering not happening for various reasons and of commitments being given. It is important we monitor that to ensure that there is tendering in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_818">I think the object for all of us should be to try to keep the cost of this hospital down. I know there are all sorts of speculation as to the cost it will reach and so on but, as I keep saying, a contract goes both ways. I asked very specifically what the triggers were whereby the State or the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board could counter-claim. I asked if there were other triggers and was told there were no other triggers. Then one of our requests back to the board was that it review the transcripts of the meeting of 16 June and confirm that it is satisfied that the information provided to the committee is entirely accurate. I will pick at just a few things in the response. Mr. Gunning said we should have drawn the committee's attention to a penalty clause on subsection completion. It goes on to state further down, regarding penalty clauses on subsection completion, "The NPHDB is currently reviewing all options that may or may not be taken in relation to liquidated damages..."</p>
          <p eId="para_819">It goes on. The issue here was that they appear to have withheld moneys at one point but, because they did not go through the correct process, there was difficulty. Essentially, they are telling us that they have to go through due process before they can seek to deduct moneys that would otherwise be due to the contractor. I would have wished to engage with them on exactly the details and fallout of that and what due process they had to go through. However, when I asked if there were other triggers, they immediately answered "No". I moved on because I thought that was the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> It is much less satisfactory to deal with this, in this kind of way, in retrospect. We were not given correct information and that was what very much annoyed me. They are now telling us that this is another trigger with regard to the process. However, I am not sure about the quantum of what could be challenged on this. We can evaluate the number of claims made by the contractor. We can be told there are 25 claims, how much they amount to and the amount of the biggest claim. However, we do not have a similar overview of this side of things. We need such an overview.</p>

It is further correspondence to the committee with regard to industrial relations matters arising from the individual's employment. We considered related correspondence at our meeting on 14 June.

It was noted last week the secretariat reviewed the committee's sent correspondence to various bodies over the summer to ensure that all of the committee's requests for information from different bodies that are accountable to it have been responded to. A table of overdue correspondence items has been circulated. It should come up on the members' screens. Approximately 20 items are outstanding. I ask members to take a moment to review them. The default position is that the secretariat will continue to follow up on all items, in line with the committee's agreement, unless the committee feels that events have overtaken any of the issues. Sometimes the information is already here by some other means, we have already obtained it, or it or it is no longer required. Are there any items listed that the committee does not wish to follow up on?</p>

          <p eId="para_874">In fairness, the secretariat puts in a lot of work chasing this stuff after meetings. As Deputies saw, keeping track of it can be difficult. Certainly, the secretariat keeps on it. If anything else comes up, the Deputy can raise it.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> The next issue is the work programme. Following agreement last week regarding meetings, availability has been confirmed for the following engagements - the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on 13 October; the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 20 October; the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on 27 October; Greyhound Racing Ireland on 10 November; and the Department of Finance on 17 November. Is it agreed to proceed on that basis? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> A swap was done for meetings on 20 and 27 October between the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to facilitate the committee, which people are happy enough with. It is agreed to move ahead on that basis. I remind members that if there are specific areas on which they wish to focus the day departmental officials are in, to flag it with the clerk and he will bring it to their attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> As discussed last week, I am reluctant to plan much further than that at this point. As members will be aware, the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021 will be available to us from the end of September and we might want to prioritise further areas for examination once we have sight of it. We may want to do that in a very timely manner. Are there any other matters that members wish to raise on the work programme? I take it they are happy. That concludes our consideration of the work programme for today.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> The last item on the agenda is any other business. Are there any other issues members wish to raise? Okay. We will go into private session for a short period to deal with a matter.</p>
