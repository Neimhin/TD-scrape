          <p eId="para_10">I welcome everyone to the meeting. Deputies Hourigan and Verona Murphy have sent their apologies.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> To limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, I ask that all those in attendance wear face coverings when not addressing the committee. The service requests that individuals continue to wear face coverings when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others and to be respectful of other people's physical space. The public health advice should be heeded.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament. </p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee. He is accompanied by Mr. Paul Southern, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> This morning we engage with the Department of Justice and officials from the Prison Service to examine the 2020 Appropriation Accounts for Vote 24, Justice, and Vote 21, Prisons. As per the committee's request, the Department has provided it with a copy of the independent review of voluntary mess committees in Irish prisons, which the committee may wish to examine during the engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> We are joined in the committee room by the following officials: Ms Caron McCaffrey, director general of the Irish Prison Service; Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General of the Department of Justice; Ms Oonagh Buckley, deputy Secretary General; Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan, assistant secretary; Mr. Seamus Clifford, assistant director; and Mr. Fergal Black, director of care and rehabilitation at the Irish Prison Service. We are also joined by Ms Marianne Nolan, principal officer for the justice Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or on silent mode. </p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege, and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> The witnesses are all very welcome. I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2022-04-28T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_20">The appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of €399 million in 2020. This was a reduction of €140 million, or 26%, on the prior year. The main reason for the reduction in the level of expenditure on the Vote was the transfer of responsibility for certain services to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth following the formation of the Government. This included the transfer out of responsibility for the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers. However, the processing of asylum applications remains the responsibility of the Department of Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The Data Protection Commission was also established as a new Vote in 2020. Previously, the commission was funded from the Justice Vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> Expenditure under the justice Vote in 2020 was distributed across five programmes. The biggest expenditure programme relates to the range of services that together address the strategic objective to "provide a safe and secure Ireland". In 2020, the total spend for that programme was €207 million. This was up almost €27 million, or 15%, year-on-year. The largest component of this spending related to criminal legal aid, which totalled just over €62 million in 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> I issued a clear audit opinion relating to the appropriation account for Vote 24. However, I drew attention to disclosures in the statement on internal financial control regarding material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts that operated in 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I also drew attention to the payment of an EU fine by the Department. The fine, in the amount of €2 million, was imposed due to delayed transposition by Ireland of an EU directive relating to money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The Irish Prison Service is formally part of the Department of Justice but is funded and accounted for separately through Vote 21. While the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for Vote 21, the Prison Service is headed operationally by its director general.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 21 records gross expenditure of almost €401 million. Around two thirds of the expenditure, totalling €271 million, relates to pay. The remainder is spread across a range of areas, including maintenance and improvements to the prison estate, equipment purchases, education and services for prisoners, and other operating costs. </p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Note 6.5 to the appropriation account provides an update as at September 2021 on progress made by the Prison Service in its arrangements for the operation of staff voluntary mess committees in the larger prisons. The note outlines that governance arrangements have been reviewed and written agreements have been put in place between the committees and the Prison Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">I understand that the Accounting Officer has provided further detailed information about the operation of the committees in recent correspondence.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account for Vote 21. However, I drew attention in my report on the audit to the basis of the valuation of land at Thornton Hall. While the land was valued by the Valuation Office at €2.7 million in 2020, the Prison Service continued to carry the assets at Thornton on the statement of financial position at the historic cost of €49.3 million. This was in contrast to the valuation method applied for all other land and building assets. In my opinion, the exceptional accounting treatment of the assets at Thornton Hall was not warranted.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> I also drew attention to material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts operating in 2020 for the supply of goods and services to the Prison Service.</p>

          <from> Ms Oonagh McPhillips<recordedTime time="2022-04-28T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_32">I am grateful for the opportunity to meet with the committee in relation to the 2020 Justice and Prisons Votes. I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his office for their work on this. The Chairman has introduced the team. With his permission, I will share my time with Ms McCaffrey.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> Vote 24, the justice Vote, is one of six in the Vote group and covers a wide remit of activity, both in the Department and a number of agencies in the justice sector. In 2020, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said, there were five expenditure programmes with 50 individual subheads. The Vote structure was realigned substantially in 2021 to take account of the Department’s major restructuring and the 2020 transfer of our integration and equality responsibilities to the expanded Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. These changes have rationalised the Vote’s structure and reduced the number of programmes from five to two - criminal justice and civil justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> Any review of 2020 must take account of the pandemic and, like the rest of the world, managing the impact of Covid-19 on our staff and business has been a central focus at all levels in the Department and the whole justice sector ever since, perhaps nowhere more so than in the prisons, which the director general will speak to shortly. The management of the pandemic in the Department has been led by the management board and the Covid-19 response management group, supported by our specialist occupational health and safety unit. This work included ensuring business continuity for the public services we provide, introducing remote working, onboarding more than 700 new staff over the past two years and safeguarding and supporting all our colleagues, including those serving abroad and those who had to remain in the workplace in front-line and public-facing roles.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> Our criminal and civil governance teams communicated regularly and consistently with our 25 agencies to support them in responding dynamically and safely to the evolving public health restrictions. It is a credit to the professionalism and commitment of the whole organisation that, working together, we succeeded in doing this and much more through the last two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> There was also a significant impact on specific areas of the business. The legislative teams supported colleagues in the Department of Health in drafting legislation and regulations, including the necessary Garda powers. The restrictions on international travel and checks on people arriving into the State meant many dynamic changes for staff of the border management unit at Dublin Airport, including supporting mandatory hotel quarantine. The pandemic impacted the provision of immigration services to our customers, necessitating the temporary extension of immigration permissions through 2020 and 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Innovations were also introduced, including the first ever online citizenship ceremony in 2020 and more followed in 2021. Under the Department’s IT strategy, we are investing in developing much-needed digital systems, but the prolonged need to either restrict or stagger staff attendance in offices increased processing times, particularly in some high-volume immigration areas. This situation improved as restrictions lifted and staff could return to offices. We took the opportunity to re-engineer and streamline processes and this has been having a positive effect in recent months.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> Members will appreciate that the recent essential work to welcome and process the refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine has necessitated the redeployment of experienced officials to staff the one-stop shop and reception centre. This currently operates from 8 a.m. to approximately 4 a.m., seven days a week, at Dublin Airport, as well as at offices in Cork, Limerick and Rosslare to facilitate those arriving through other ports of entry. This whole-of-government operation has received and processed over 25,000 people under the EU's temporary protection directive over the last two months. The compassion and professionalism of colleagues involved is a great credit to them and reflects the response of the whole country to Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> Returning to Covid, as the country entered the first lockdown in March 2020, the Department was acutely aware of the huge difficulties and fear that restricting people’s movement could bring to those at risk of domestic abuse. Colleagues quickly developed and implemented an inter-agency plan, including the Still Here public awareness campaign. This was a collaboration with front-line services in the public sector and in civil society in order to reassure victims that the practical supports they needed would still be available. Additional financial supports were provided to front-line NGO partners and measures were put in place across the sector, including through An Garda Síochána’s Operation Faoiseamh. The Judiciary and the Courts Service also prioritised domestic abuse cases and provided for remote hearings for protection orders where necessary. The Irish Prison Service risk-assessed those being released from prisons and the Legal Aid Board established a helpline to provide prompt legal advice and legal representation in court where needed. The success of An Garda Síochána’s community engagement and policing strategy through the pandemic has rightly been recognised and I know the committee also recently heard from the Policing Authority about its important oversight work, which has had significant value in maintaining public trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> There are a large number of agencies in this Vote but I want to mention in particular Forensic Science Ireland, as its long-planned, state-of-the-art laboratory HQ is nearing the final stages of construction. I am pleased to report that despite the impact of the restrictions on construction activities in the earlier phases of the project, the lab is now on-track for completion this year within its budget of €99.5 million. This new facility will be one of the most sophisticated pieces of public infrastructure ever constructed in this country and will provide the hard-working staff of Forensic Science Ireland, with a high-spec, purpose-built facility, achieving the highest standards for evidence processing, analysis and storage. It represents a very significant investment in our criminal justice system and the future of the Forensic Science Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I will now hand over to Ms McCaffrey.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Ms Caron McCaffrey<recordedTime time="2022-04-28T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_42">As the Secretary General has outlined, it has been a truly remarkable and challenging period for communities across the globe and Covid- 19 has also had a major impact on the Irish Prison Service as we sought to keep all those who live and work in our prisons safe. As a service, we have proven to be adaptable, flexible, resilient and highly innovative and our staff have embraced the challenges presented to us by the pandemic with professionalism and dedication.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> The year 2020 saw the introduction of new and innovative methods of service delivery, including the delivery of teleservices for chaplaincy and psychology; maintaining links with family and friends virtually using video link technology; the introduction of electronic money transfer systems in partnership with An Post; and the introduction of in-cell telephones to help prisoners keep in contact with their loved ones and to support their mental health. As a result, we were able to face down the challenges of Covid-19 and continue to provide the best possible level of service to prisoners in our care and to their families. In early 2021, it became clear to all of us that living with Covid-19 was going to be a reality for some time. Many of these new systems introduced in response to Covid-19 have now become essential tools for the delivery of prisoner services and for supporting prisoners, and have been permanently retained as we have moved into a less restricted environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> Preventing the spread of infection into prisons and keeping those in our care safe did have an impact on expenditure and on the costs of providing prisoner services in 2020, with additional costs relating to the purchase of personal protective equipment for staff and prisoners, additional infection control costs, and healthcare and specialist cleaning supply costs. This was necessary expenditure to mitigate against the risk posed by the virus and our infection control measures were central in our success in effectively managing the threat posed by Covid-19 in a prison setting.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> In 2020, additional funding was provided to the Irish Prison Service under the Government economic stimulus package. This allowed for a number of important projects to be advanced, such as building roof repairs, CCTV and security system upgrades, nationwide carbon reduction LED lighting replacement and upgrades to fire alarms.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> Notwithstanding the challenges presented by Covid-19 since 2020, the Irish Prison Service has continued to deliver on the strategic actions set out in our current strategic plan, including our programme of prison modernisation. Despite the impact on the construction sector due to the closure of construction sites at certain times, significant progress was made during 2020 on the capital development project at Limerick Prison. Work on the project has continued in 2021 and 2022 and the project remains within budget and is expected to be completed later this year. The project will provide quality accommodation for prisoners and enhanced services, and will provide an additional 90 male prison spaces and 22 additional female prison spaces.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> Over the lifetime of our strategy, we have continued to implement a programme of reform within our service. We continue to work closely with our key stakeholders to enhance the supports available for prisoners, including supporting prisoners on their transition from prison back into their communities. As we emerge from this global pandemic, work is now turning to the development of a new strategic plan for our service through which we will build on recent reforms and take account of our experiences and learning from the past two years.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">I thank all of the staff in the Department of Justice and the Prison Service for their work over the past two years, in particular. It has been a very difficult time for everyone, given the role of the Garda, the Prison Service and the Department. I thank them for all the work that was done over that difficult period.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> On the issue of capital projects, Ms McPhillips referred to the roll-out of the Forensic Science Ireland's laboratory headquarters, which is on time and will remain within cost. I understand the project will cost €99.5 million. Does that include fully kitting out the facility and having it fully operational? When is the project likely to be finalised?</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> During the transition of evidence from one facility to another, the chain of evidence cannot be broken. How is that planned to be dealt with to ensure there are no gaps in the transition period? Has that been planned for? Over what time period will that take place?

          <p eId="para_53">I thank the Deputy. A lot of planning has gone into that. The project is well advanced. It is 79% complete at this stage. The building is watertight. A reasonable amount of it has been kitted out. There were 235 people on-site at the building in February, which I thought was a fascinating number. It is a massive project.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> There is a detailed transition plan. The move will start in the third quarter of this year. The building will be handed over from the contractor in or around August, we hope. Then, from August until the end of the year, there will be a detailed transition to move the existing operation out, as well as the accreditations which are necessary for each part of the system. Obviously, all the scientific end of it has to be accredited to the international standard. There will therefore be a certain amount of dual use of the existing laboratory in the Phoenix Park and then the transition to the new one.

          <p eId="para_59">It was Glanmire Garda Station. Contracts were signed and an issue then arose about whether to proceed with the contract. Full interest was paid on the purchase price for a period of, I think, six years. Interest of six years was paid. It was one of those projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> I wonder about the mechanism in place for projects from start to finish. The Office of Public Works is involved in some of these projects. There is also the issue of buildings which are no longer being used, for instance, we had problems with many old Garda stations. The issues then arises of the existing building housing the forensic science laboratory. What is the process for dealing with projects from start to finish? In view of the fact that building costs are changing by the day, is there a need to have a process in place so that decisions are made in a timely manner, rather than waiting for two or three years for a decision to be taken? It should be taken from start to finish.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">There was a lot in that. In terms of capital projects generally, we are guided by the public spending code, which is our bible in these things. We have to follow all the requirements in the public spending code. We rely to a great extent on OPW in relation to acquiring sites and the verification of whether a site is a suitable and meets all the requirements of the particular project. The different agencies in the Department have slightly different approaches to these things. The Courts Service has a huge capital programme. The Accounting Officer for the Courts Service is responsible for that. An Garda Síochána has a big capital programme, as do the prisons, and the Garda Commissioner is the accounting officer for that.</p>

In that case, contracts were sent to the Office of the Chief State solicitor and the OPW to sign off on them. There was a gap of two years between the contracts being sent and being signed. The project was delayed by two years. What mechanisms have the Department of Justice in place to ensure a delay like that does not occur?</p>

We are trying to do is make sure the projects that are ready for the road or “shovel ready”, as the old expression goes, get going as fast as they can. The legal aspects of it, and I know the Deputy will appreciate this, are important. We have to get the due diligence right with contracts. There can be a frustration with how long that takes. Contracts are important and the devil is in the detail, so it is necessary to go through that.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> In terms of us doing a review of the whole capital piece, what we did in preparation for the national development plan, NDP, was look across the whole sector to see what the needs were.

          <p eId="para_68">The policing, security and community safety Bill is a big undertaking, which has just completed pre-legislative scrutiny. We hope to get the report from the justice committee on it. In terms of the projects, the Deputy is absolutely right that there will be a real implementation challenge and a huge number of regulations to be made once the legislation is done. On the preparatory work to implement the measures, there is a huge amount of change involved for the oversight bodies in particular, but also for An Garda Síochána and the Department itself. We have an implementation project. I will ask Mr. O’Sullivan to come in on this because it is under his remit. We have approximately seven individual projects, one of which is in relation to GSOC and the changes that will be needed there. We are doing a review of how the process will operate. I ask Mr. O’Sullivan to come in at this point. </p>

          <p eId="para_69">It is a major project. We have a team established solely to look after its implementation. Ever before the legislation is fully enacted, we have already commenced the work in scoping out what will need to be done under each of the seven or eight projects, the number of which will depend on how we decide to break it out. All of the agencies will be involved in that. At some point, we will need to get external advice to tease out the implementation details and make sure the whole thing fits together because all of the different parts in intersect with each other. We need to make sure they are all properly lined out.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> Even as we are hopefully moving through the Oireachtas with the enactment of the legislation, as things may emerge from detailed implementation planning, we will be able to bring that back to the Oireachtas and explain how this or that is going to work out or maybe some tweaks need to be made here or there.

          <p eId="para_74">Is any income being generated from those lands at this stage? What does the Department plan to do to deal with this? It is a large amount of money that was expended. It was €30 million to buy it and €20 million of infrastructure has been put in place but it is still idle. No State agency is using it but taxpayer money was spent on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_76"> The Deputy asked if this has been flagged to other State agencies. At various times in the past five or six years, we have had discussions with Fingal County Council, IDA Ireland and, since its establishment, the Land Development Agency on a number of occasions. There is interest in it but we regard it as a strategic State asset. As the Deputy said, it is fully serviced and quite close to Dublin Airport. We definitely have a strategic interest in a portion of the site from a criminal justice perspective but we would be open to discussions on the rest of the site. We have signalled that to the relevant agencies. The Land Development Agency, in particular, is keeping it as an option. I will yield to the experts on this, and their view is it would not be suitable for housing but it may be suitable for decanting other strategic infrastructure from other areas. They are keeping that under review but it is more of a long-term consideration.</p>

Significant progress has been made on concluding those claims. There have been 2,773 claims received, of which 2,040 are concluded. I suppose the contingent liability that the State Claims Agency put against that scheme was quite high at over €30 million but the expectation now is the scheme will be concluded at around €15 million. There are specific caps in place for compensation and there are also caps in place regarding legal fees that can be paid.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">The Deputy is quite right in that hepatitis C is now both preventable and curable. It is more prevalent among the prisoner population due to issues related to addiction, high-risk behaviour and some people's inability to access services. The HSE has a national programme and over 5,000 patients in the State are now being treated with highly effective direct acting antiviral drugs for hepatitis C. Professor Aidan McCormick, the HSE clinical lead for the hepatitis C programme, has engaged directly with us and is committed to giving access to all communities, including prisoners, and that is very important for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> We now have a process in place with the HSE and pilot projects will be rolled out in Cork and Limerick prisons in the first instance to ensure we can provide a robust and comprehensive hepatitis C programme, similar to what is happening in the community, and where this can lead to a point where the condition is curable for people entering prison. During the course of this year the programme will roll out in the two prisons and be extended.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">Okay. I do not have much time. I would like to touch on the ongoing debacle relating to and the set of debacles that resulted in the killing of Shane O'Farrell in 2011. In 2019, a scoping inquiry was established instead of the full public inquiry that both Houses of the Oireachtas had unanimously called for. Considering that it is now 2022, and I assume that the witnesses will not be able to give us any sense of when that the scoping inquiry will be concluded, does the Department accept that scoping inquiries in respect of matters such as that to which I refer are not an appropriate way to provide answers? Does it also accept that the scoping inquiry in this case has become just another blockage for the family of Shane O'Farrell and for those of us who want to find out precisely how his tragic death was allowed to happen?</p>

On 15 May 2019, the then Minister for Justice signed the terms of reference, approved by the Attorney General, for a review of the District Court system, which, in addition to the error, was also supposed to examine existing risks and so on.

          <p eId="para_149">I welcome the witnesses, some of whom have been before the committee previously. They are very welcome back. In the time that I have, I will focus first and foremost on the Comptroller and Auditor General's remarks and opening statement and specifically on non-compliance in the context of Vote 21 and 24. A number of reasons have been provided for that non-compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">I note that in Vote 21 there were 16 contracts totalling €15.5 million. Some of those projects went beyond the original contract date and others were rolled over. What procedures have now been put in place to deal with those issues?</p>

          <p eId="para_154">To reassure the Deputy, a considerable amount of work has been done to ensure we become fully compliant with our procurement processes. That includes a new contract management system to allow us to start planning at the earliest possible stage for a contract to be awarded. We have a comprehensive corporate procurement plan. We have engaged external professional procurement consultants to assist us in ensuring we are fully compliant.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> In 2020, the deputy and Comptroller and Auditor General appointed 16 contracts to a total value of €15.15 million, where contracts were rolled over. That compares with 26 such contracts in 2019 so there has been an improvement. The value in 2019 was €18.5 million so our figures are going in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> Of those 16 contracts, five involved the Office of Government Procurement. I can inform the Deputy that all of those contracts are now in place. Eleven cases were being managed by the Irish Prison Service and I can assure the Deputy that all of those contracts are now in place, with the exception of one which is currently out to tender for a value of €93,000. I can also inform the Deputy that we continue to make improvements in this regard. The value of our non-compliant procurement radically reduced in 2021 to €5.6 million. So far this year, only two contracts are non-compliant. It is an area of particular focus for the prison service and we have made good progress in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">There is. The Probation Service is one of our many agencies but it is a particularly successful one in terms of what it does. I might ask Mr. O'Sullivan, who looks after governance of the criminal agencies, to come in but we have a governance agreement in place that is fully compliant. Mr. O'Sullivan may wish to expand on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">The Department has a governance agreement in place for three years with the Probation Service. We also have an annual performance delivery agreement. Under those arrangements, we meet the head of the Probation Service at least twice a year and back that up with a constant stream of regular informal engagement and support. In fact, the Minister met the Probation Service and senior team on-site in the past week or so and had a very good engagement. We obviously set targets and the resource allocations, and work closely with the Probation Service to consider where it is going strategically in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> There are also service level agreements for the provision of ICT and financial services. The Probation Service relies on the Department for a lot of those central support services.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">I have something here in that regard. I will come back to the Deputy in a moment. The top offences referred to the service in 2020 related to drugs offences. Approximately 75% of referrals related to drugs offences, theft, assault, public order, road traffic and burglary. The number of offenders dealt with in the community in 2020 was 15,500. The figure for 2021 was 15,400. Some 9,300 probation reports were completed for court in 2020 and 10,000 were completed in 2021. That shows a considerable volume of business.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">I will turn now to consider compensation and legal costs, specifically table 6.2 in the document relating to Vote 21. I am struck by the number of claims that have been made by prisoners for injury and other actions involving prisoners. There are 445 claims of that kind and more than €2 million has been awarded in compensation. There are 107 civil claims for injuries received while on duty and other issues involving prison staff, which is a high number. There are 110 claims through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal arising out of injuries received by prison staff. Have our guests the figures for recent years that we could use as a comparison? Has that trend increased? The number of prisoner claims seems high. Have those numbers increased or decreased?</p>

          <p eId="para_184">I do not have comparative figures with me. I will follow up on that point. As I mentioned earlier, many of the claims by prisoners relate to in-cell sanitation. We have received a significant number of in-cell sanitation claims and they account for many of the claims made by prisoners.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> Unfortunately, our staff do become injured on duty. There are some slips, trips and falls but it is obviously a difficult environment. Our staff are required to break up altercations between prisoners and become injured while doing so. They are also, unfortunately, assaulted from time to time.

          <p eId="para_189">I thank our guests for coming before the committee. I have many questions about prisons. The Joint Committee on Justice recently spoke to Ms McCaffrey and Mr. Black. It is good to see them again.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> Much of what we have been talking about relates to the costs and benefits of the rehabilitation programmes and the emphasis on the rehabilitation of prisoners with a particular focus on libraries, education and access to education. The spending review for 2021, the Review of the Programme of Work and Training in the Irish Prison Service, was produced by Ms Caroline Finn.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">It states it does not represent the official views of the Department or Minister for Justice, so I am not sure what its status is. Will Ms McCaffrey clarify its status?</p>

          <p eId="para_192">That was something we had sought as a review because we certainly see that work and training is very successful. We want to ensure that what we are doing at a prison level is aligned to what is happening within the employment market.

          <p eId="para_193">Fair enough. The second key finding states: “Approximately 30% of the prison population take part in Work and Training at any given time, though this is not the only structured activity available in prisons.” That figure seems low. Is it a fair reflection?</p>

          <p eId="para_194">If we compare that with education, in February 2022, 45% of the prison population were engaging in education. Within a prison, you may go to school for the day or you may go to work and training. In some cases, you may go to school in the morning and to work and training in the afternoon. Obviously, from a Prison Service perspective, we encourage as many prisoners as we can to participate in work, training and education. There has been an impact because of Covid, unfortunately, but we are now back at a stage where our workshops and education facilities are operating at maximum capacity. One of the core functions of the Prison Service is to help people gain an educational qualification or a work training qualification so that they are much more employable on release.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">I do not have a statistic with me, I am afraid. The majority of prisoners self-declare that they require protection; it is not a regime imposed on them by the Prison Service. It is much more difficult for people to access education and work training under those circumstances. However, we make every effort to ensure they have access to activities. In certain prisons, schools would be open on certain mornings or afternoons for protection prisoners. Similarly, teachers in some prisons go to protection landings to ensure those prisoners can engage in education.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">In each instance the reports go through, difficulties are identified with education and training for protection prisoners, in particular, and access to that. I appreciate the point Ms McCaffrey made about self-declaration, but the State is paying for these prisoners to be in prison and it is part of the prison rules, and of the Nelson Mandela Rules, that people should have access to education and training. That is a key part of the strategy.</p>

          <p eId="para_206">In fact, I am familiar with it. There is a cost to that and to providing the digital tools that are necessary for it. The Prison Service could come under criticism at a later stage for having invested in the sorts of digital tools, such as tablets and so on, that would be necessary to deliver that and I do not think it should be criticised for that. I am trying to pre-empt that criticism. A consistent recommendation in the report of the Inspector of Prisons is that digital tools such as tablets be made available to prisoners in order that interaction can take place with education facilities outside the prisons to ameliorate some of the difficulties we are talking about.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">We recently met some of our colleagues in Her Majesty's Prison Service to look at what they have done from a digitisation perspective, particularly in respect of in-cell technology to support learning and to support prisoners with mental health issues in accessing government services. We are planning a trip, along with some of our colleagues from the Department, to look at what has been done there and to see if we can build on what we have done during the Covid-19 pandemic. I certainly believe a central focus of our new strategy will be on ensuring the tools are available to prisoners within their cells.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">Significant sums were spent over the past three years on enhancing library facilities, yet libraries have been closed and there has been difficulty in accessing libraries, particularly in Arbour Hill, Cloverhill and Mountjoy. This issue arises in the context of the different programmes for prisons’ officers, whether they relate to regime management plans or the organisation of the prisons more generally. The library seems to be the first facility to go every time, with the additional gym instructor being cancelled. Access to education is always the first thing to be removed. On our recent visit, we talked about staff being occupied by court visits and so on. That is a necessary part of the process and it would not be a solution to have remote hearings only, and perhaps the courts should come to the prisons if there is an overwhelming issue in that regard. Are the regime management plans, following lockdown and from now on, task specific or office specific? For example, are staff attached specifically to committals or to the library? Is there an opportunity for enhanced efficiency? If, for example, committals take up only a part of the day, could that person then be assigned to a different task, such as opening the library again?</p>

          <p eId="para_209">Our regime management plans are premised on the basis that not always the same service is cut. Regrettably, there are unpredictable draws on staff and that has an impact on the services. The purpose of the regime management plan is to give as much predictability as we can to services so that they know in advance that they are not going to be in a position to do face-to-face work and can plan their administrative work around it. Some of the difficulties with closures of libraries earlier in the Covid pandemic were infection control issues, such as the sharing and cleaning of books, and that constituted a significant part of the closures. I might ask my colleague-----</p>

          <p eId="para_214">I am the person responsible for services at prison level. Maintaining all the services is a difficulty because, as the director general pointed out, there is a draw on staff to carry out necessary court escorts and so on. We have also had to assign staff temporarily to Covid duties over recent years. I am reassured by the Minister, as recently as yesterday, having made clear that in order to address this systemic problem, she wishes to seek to secure, through the Estimates process this year, additional resources for the Prison Service. From my perspective, that should ensure we will be able to provide psychology, education and work training services on a more optimal basis because it is a challenge to maintain them all daily.</p>

          <p eId="para_217"> My first question relates to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's 2020 spending review of the performance targets in policing, and to the Department of Justice’s evaluation in light of the level of management information currently being received from An Garda Síochána regarding the value of money for policing. What oversight does the Department of Justice have of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's report on design and performance indicators in policing? What work is being done in this area?</p>

          <p eId="para_218">We have a performance agreement in place with An Garda Síochána and there are twice-annual - or perhaps quarterly - governance meetings between me and the Garda Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Then there are monthly performance meetings with An Garda Síochána and ourselves, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Policing Authority. Those are very exacting performance meetings every month. They assist with where the Garda is at, what is going on and where it needs to get to. I might ask Mr. O'Sullivan to expand on this if it is okay because he oversees the governance side.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_157">
          <from> Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2022-04-28T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_220">I will just make a few additional comments. We have worked very closely as part of developing our performance arrangements with all the agencies to integrate the work we are doing around performance targets and KPIs with the work the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the Revised Estimates volume. As the committee knows, in the Revised Estimates volume each Vote appears alongside key outputs and public service activities and measurements. We now ensure what we are engaging with the agency on is lined up to what is appearing in that so there is a clear link between the money that has been voted and the type of indicators being provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> Performance targets in the area of policing are obviously a complex area. There is clearly a long way to go and I think all the agencies will accept that. The other thing to say is there are other important actors in the oversight environment for An Garda Síochána, principally the Policing Authority which through the annual policing plan engages with the Commissioner and his senior team around their targets under the policing plan and also holds them to exacting account. It takes part in the monthly resource meeting the Secretary General has referred to. Ourselves, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the authority and An Garda Síochána work closely on managing wider resource issues and what kind of impacts there are. It is internationally recognised as an area where there is more work to be done and obviously ensuring we do not skew activity by putting in indicators that are easy to measure but are not necessarily what communities want. A lot of it goes beyond numbers. The Garda has done much work around assessing community confidence in its services and sometimes that is at least as important as whether or not a particular number of incidents is reported or whatever. There is an awful lot of work in the space but more to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">I thank Mr. O'Sullivan for his briefing. On the mechanisms in place for the Department, if An Garda Síochána does not meet its performance indicators, what type of procedures are in place, or how is that being dealt with?</p>

          <p eId="para_223">Where you get into areas of non-compliance in terms of things that are about, say, procurement and so on, then clearly corrective action needs to be taken in that space. However, more generally, what you have is an iterative process, and this is something the Policing Authority would speak to as well, where you are working through the issue and asking the organisation to go back and review what it is doing to try to reach the target or maybe identify why the target has not been met and what are the factors. Usually there are a lot of external factors that would impact on levels of activity so there is kind of an iterative process rather than a command and control one. At the end of the day, the Commissioner remains accountable and responsible for the performance reports and we work through the issues with them as they arise.</p>

The Garda is the envy of its counterparts worldwide as a growing service, both with respect to sworn members and also civilians. There is lots more expertise in the Garda staff cohort as well. The growth of that is really important. Digital and IT is an important area from our point of view to get the best value, to ensure the staff of An Garda Síochána have the best tools available to them and to combat the growth in ever more sophisticated cybercrime, etc., but also just ordinary crime. Every element of crime has a digital element to it now and gardaí need the tools to combat that.</p>

The Commission had instituted legal proceeding and we ended up with a fine. We have done a lot of work on our transposition of EU measures generally but on that one, a fine of €2 million was paid to the Commission in 2020 due to the delayed transposition of the directive. It referred to a period between July 2017 and December 2019 that related to the enactment of both the primary and secondary legislation for that directive. I should add there are two more directives since. It is an ever-evolving area and we are constantly trying to keep up to date on money laundering.

          <p eId="para_254">We need a note on that aspect so we can examine it. It was an area where some significant issues arose in recent years, especially during Covid-19. I would certainly like to have a look at what the Department has to say about non-compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> Turning to the Dóchas Centre during Covid-19, two reports were carried out but they have not been published. The most recent response I received to a parliamentary question stated that, "based on legal advice received by my Department, it is not proposed to publish the report at this time". Somebody said the Prison Service did an exceptional job in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. One of these reports concerns Covid-19 and the experience in the Dóchas Centre. I cannot understand why that report would not be published. It should be published. Ms McPhillips might tell us what is meant by “at this time”? The other report may or may not be linked to the original report. We would need to see it to evaluate that aspect. Is it intended, at some point, to publish these reports? What is the impediment to publishing a report relating to Covid-19?</p>

          <p eId="para_256">There are threads running between the two reports. There is also a separate process that I cannot go into. Between all that, the strong legal advice is that we cannot publish these reports at this time. We are examining them to see if there may be elements we can publish, because we do want this information in the public domain. We also want to implement the recommendations. We are not, however, in a position to publish the report at this time based on the legal advice.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">Okay. Moving on to Thornton Hall, the new valuation for the site is €6.2 million. The Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to the valuation of €2.7 million. In this context, there is the land itself, but also the significant development of a road and lighting at the site, which means it is now fully serviced. That is my understanding. Can Ms McPhillips provide the methodology to explain the variance between the €2.7 million and €6.2 million valuations? We already know there is a significant issue regarding the historical cost of the site. What is the methodology? How are the valuations so different?</p>

          <p eId="para_264">We did not value it ourselves. We get expert valuation people to do it. In 2015, it was valued at €2.4 million. It was then valued in 2020 at €2.7 million. Probably because of Covid-19, but I am only speculating in this regard, that was a paper-based, desk exercise. It did seem to us to be a reasonable valuation in respect of the increase in land values between 2015 and 2017. On foot of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s views on this issue, we sought a further valuation and that was €6.7 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">There are 150 acres. Our interest is in roughly 40 acres. The remainder of the site is available for development by the State. We flagged this in 2015 and 2016 to Fingal County Council and we had a detailed discussion about the site's proximity, or lack thereof, to Ashbourne. The council feels it is outside their zones in respect of being suitable for housing, and I yield to the experts on this matter. The land is a little bit distant from both those things. We also flagged the availability of the land to the IDA, which has looked at it several times. More recently, when the LDA was established, we flagged the availability of land with that organisation as well and we have had discussions in this regard. Ms McCaffrey and I met with representatives of the LDA in recent weeks to discuss this issue. Additionally, in the context of the war in Ukraine, we have also flagged the availability of the site. If the land is not suitable for housing, and again other people will decide the suitability in this regard, then it may also not be suitable for modular housing in the context of the refugee crisis either. The site is, however, suitable for other developments.</p>

It was implemented in nine months, from January 2019 to the end of September 2019, and in full at that time. The consultants who supported us to do the transformation were EY, but the Department very much led the process. That was completed at the time. Elements of the Department were unaffected by that process and we always knew we would have to return to them. The immigration area is one of them. We are now looking at immigration from the perspectives of its structure and its modernisation. I refer to bringing digital services----</p>

          <p eId="para_310">I may have clarified the last time that there were two staff events that were incorrectly coded to the prisoner assistance programme fund. Those funds should have come under staff development. I have actually abolished the prisoner assistance programme fund, PAPF. It was based on the profits generated from our tuck shops. The money was primarily spent to address prisoner hardship, on prisoner programmes and to support our community return and community support programmes. I was of the view that selling items in the tuck shop as an economic activity was not really what the Prison Service is about. It is a service to prisoners. We have changed the manner in which our tuck shops operate and, instead of selling at recommended retail prices, we now sell products at cost plus 5%. The programmes that were previously supported by that fund now receive Exchequer funding. We received Exchequer funding for prisoner programmes and to support the community support and community return programmes. However, we continue to sell tobacco at cost price. That generates enough money to allow governors to support prisoners who find themselves in economic hardship.</p>

          <p eId="para_328">Just to clarify, moneys that are involved in the mess committee are not public moneys, rather they are staff moneys. It is money collected to reimburse the costs of the meals provided. This is not public money that we are talking about. I think the Deputy is referring to a staff recognition event that took place in Mountjoy Prison, for which the mess committee, from its own funds, purchased a small amount of alcohol. I would clarify that the mess in Mountjoy Prison is not within the confines of the prison. It is outside the prison, just inside the main gate. I will further clarify that there is not a provision in the Civil Service code that prohibits alcohol being consumed at an event. I can clarify that there is certainly no alcohol being consumed within our prisons. This was a specific staff recognition event that took place outside of work hours and the moneys involved were the staff's own moneys, not voted or public moneys.</p>

          <p eId="para_352">There are two aspects to it. There is an initial disclosure, or perhaps multiple disclosures, depending on the circumstances. First of all, they are assessed. They are then investigated by an external concern. These issues may sometimes morph into or may be factors in more wide-ranging systemic examinations that the Department does or causes to be done of specific issues. In that instance, there may not be the read-across from the initial process around the discloser's own concerns into the bigger issue. However, obviously, the issues are taken into account.</p>

I understand that prison is a very challenging environment and staff are dealing with very challenging situations at times and all of that. However, prisons would have a high level of autonomy and Ms McPhillips outlined that in her briefing notes, which I read yesterday. I would be aware of that from Portlaoise and Midlands Prison, which is just up the road from me. Some whistleblowers seem to go through the consequences of the whistleblowing - I suppose I could phrase it that way. For some whistleblowers who I have spoken to, the turn of events since and the outworking of the cases would confirm that they suffered enormously.</p>

          <p eId="para_355">I will make this point to Ms McCaffrey as well that because each prison has much autonomy, it is important that if staff come forward with genuine information that is not vexatious or anything like that, that not only do we have the process there for them to whistleblow, but also that the consequences do cause suffering. We cannot have a situation where staff that come forward are bullied, browbeaten or forced out of their job. We cannot have situations such as that. That has happened, unfortunately. I will not name any specific cases. There is one case that I am aware of and have followed very carefully. The consequences for that person and her family have been absolutely enormous. The Prison Service has a duty of care. It is not like a lot of other jobs. It is not like being on a building site or working in here or in an office. It is different.

We have very limited availability to build on the existing footprint of the prison estate. We are putting a new wing on Limerick Prison at the moment.

One of the issues that has bedevilled Mountjoy Prison, and one of the reasons we wanted to move to greenfield site, is the issue of drugs being thrown over the yards and its proximity to the canals. Certainly, that remains a problem. Many of our prisons are inner-city prisons. The greenfield site offers an especially secure location for the construction of any new prison.</p>

Certainly when one looks at this exercise, it appears this way. The current valuation is €6.5 million. That is based on its agricultural zoning. If a use was to be proposed, there would be an application to rezone and the value, as Deputy Catherine Murphy said earlier, would be for whatever would be put on it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill<recordedTime time="2022-04-28T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_395">I would like to return to the question of prisons and Covid. I think prisons did an incredible job, especially in the first wave, of protecting prisoners and staff in overcrowded congregated settings from what could have been an absolute catastrophe. It came at a significant price, however, and there is an opportunity to learn from that. It is clear from going through all the reports of the Inspector of Prisons that prisoners reported very significant information about how not to get Covid but much less information about what to do if they had it and how that was to be managed. There was a significant mental health impact from the isolation that was necessary, especially in the first wave, including the missing of family visits. There is an opportunity there.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> I would like to refer to the staff survey that was done in 2021 by the Office of the Inspector of Prisons. The staff recommended in-cell telephones and video calls to improve relationships with family members and to improve mental health. This would have obvious benefits for education and training and access to mental health supports, which is a big problem irrespective of Covid. That recommendation came from the staff. Sometimes one is criticised for providing services to prisoners, but this is a staff recommendation. I want to amplify it from the staff survey.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> There is an ongoing concern about the mental health impact of the current quarantine experience. Ms McPhillips is aware of that but I want to flag it to her because it will come back. These things can come back in many different ways from a cost perspective to the State. In terms of the directions that were possible under the Act, it was July 2021 before a direction was given. However, the sunset side of things is not clear with regard to unlocking and unwinding the restrictions on exercise and so on. Ms McPhillips is aware of that also but these are the difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> We spoke in great detail about Dóchas at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, but the overcrowding in Dóchas and the refurbishment that is necessary are very significant. There is an ongoing problem about the profile of people there with overwhelming addiction, mental health and welfare issues, many of whom should not be there but need to be in supported facilities. I am not sure where the Department is moving and whether sufficient departmental priority is being given to being able to move to that. We have gone through it in detail at the justice committee but I just wanted to highlight it here again.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> Deputies have talked about the cost to the State of the slopping-out cases. It was €1.5 million in compensation and another €500,000 in legal costs for in-cell sanitation for 2020 and 2019. It comes with the overcrowding problem. In the Inspector of Prisons report on Arbour Hill, one can see the effect of a doubled-up bunk being in a single cell with a toilet, with no screen between the toilet and the lower bunk. Prisoners report trying to use the toilet on the landing for each other's dignity. These are ongoing very visible and obvious problems that have to be addressed, especially where there are not separate sanitation options.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> With regard to the priority areas under the regime management plan, RMP, there will be work on training as an essential service. That will be prioritised.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> I want to leave prisons for a second. The money laundering directive came from the EU in 2015. Ms McPhillips said there was a difficulty between July 2017 and 2019 in the transposition of it. Will she clarify that? It was a 2015 directive. It should have been implemented by 2017.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">I wish the work had begun. As the Secretary General said, it was part of an overall suite of measures, including perhaps other EU measures which had more pressing timelines even at that point. The other complication in this instance was that the State fell foul of a change in European Commission practice in regard to the enforcement penalties beginning in January 2017. Previously, where a member state had remedied the infringement by the time the case came to court, the Commission would not seek a fine. The Commission changed its practice so that by the time this came to court - and this is not an excuse obviously but the context-----</p>

          <p eId="para_414"> I will go back to Ms McPhillips who made a comment earlier that caused me concern so I want to make sure I understand what she means. She said that we are constantly keeping up with money laundering directives, and that there were subsequent directives. That phrase "constantly keeping up" raises a very large flag for me. Given what we are seeing with Russia, the difficulties throughout Europe and our own exposure even though it is very small going by those figures from the Department of Finance, I do not like that phrase from Ms McPhillips. Would she like to clarify or explain what she means?</p>

          <p eId="para_421">This is linked. The ODCE was to be replaced by the Corporate Enforcement Agency. The expectation was that would happen in January. My understanding is that there was an error in the legislation as well as an issue around the provision of gardaí and that there was a memorandum of understanding, MOU. What role did the Department have in the MOU? Has it been signed at this stage? When the Garda Síochána was in recently, we were told it would be within weeks. A huge level of frustration was expressed when it was discovered in FOI. We are seeing cases, for example, the FAI case. People are wondering where it is. I do not think that the new body has the extent of powers that it should have but the very fact that these new and expanded powers are not in place yet is a huge frustration.</p>

Mr. Black and I, and all of the decision makers, met a group of prisoners in our progression unit on Monday - our Red Cross volunteers - who had done a survey to help us better understand the impact of isolation and quarantine on them. We took that away to make sure we have the learnings for the future, but also to look at what we can do now to support people with their mental health. We are looking at group psychology sessions to support people because of the impact of isolation and quarantine, which were absolutely necessary in the context of Covid outbreaks within the prisons but which, regrettably, were quite impactful on people. We are very attuned to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">It seems to be taking a long time. As I recall, Judge Mary Martin promoted this approach a decade ago. It is acknowledged that it is a successful approach to reparation, which is very important for victims, but also in moving people away from reoffending. Why can the process not be accelerated? Ms McCaffrey has a problem with prison space and people have to be doubled up in cells that are not suitable. It would be better if the cells where there is slopping out were empty and we did not have prisoners in them. Most people would agree with that, but because of the pressure for space within the Prison Service, with approximately 3,500 prisoners, people are being committed to prison who will reoffend. Why are more programmes of restorative justice not being rolled out? It is a benefit, even if we only look at it from a financial position. That is one concern, but reducing crime and antisocial activity and improving community safety should be the big considerations. Why is this process not being driven on more quickly across the State?</p>

          <p eId="para_501">I could not agree with you more, Chair, on this. A review of penal policy is nearing completion at the moment and that will set out the guiding principles for our priorities. Restorative justice is one of those priorities and a sparing approach to the use of imprisonment. Prison is a sanction of last resort. You are quite right, Chair, about the need to invest in restorative justice on a consistent basis in terms of its application across the country. Announcing it, as we said earlier-----</p>

          <p eId="para_502">I am sorry for interrupting Ms McPhillips, but the model is working in Tipperary and in other countries. It is frustrating. People are being sent to prison and while I am not advocating locking people up and throwing away the key, the system does not allow for reparation for victims. I recall one case where an individual had robbed four or five different households and they got a number of weeks in prison and then they came out.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I remember totting up the amount of money stolen as this detail came out in the court case. Surely it would have been better for the person to repay the money and make reparations to the victims. If the people who had been burgled or assaulted received some compensation from the perpetrator or if there had to have been a restorative justice element of some kind, that would have been better. This has been proven internationally and everyone in the Garda up to the Garda Commissioner knows it. While I do not want to misrepresent him, my understanding is the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, wants it. Senior gardaí at all levels believe this is the way to go. Why are we not doing it?</p>

It had a very passionate advocate in Judge Michael Reilly, who initiated it originally. We want to create that kind of provision throughout the country and have that as an option for the courts because ultimately it will be for the court to decide the appropriate sanction. It is absolutely vital in addressing criminality and addressing people's behaviours, surfacing the issue that has caused the criminality in the first place.

          <p eId="para_511">I return to the question I asked earlier about the hepatitis C treatment programme. My understanding is there was a particular issue with prisoners needing to be taken from Cork Prison to an outpatient clinic in Cork University Hospital for their care. I had understood it was proposed that all treatment would take place within prisons rather than having to incur the additional cost of taking prisoners to a medical facility. What is the proposed programme for hepatitis C? As it is a 12-week programme, it is an ideal opportunity. There will be significant long-term savings in the cost of medical treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> What is the proposal for the old prison in Cork? Obviously, there is a maintenance cost associated with a facility not being used. What are the plans for that property now?</p>

          <p eId="para_513">I will pick up on the issue of hepatitis C. The intention is that the treatment plan will be devised over an eight-week period and, as the Deputy points out, it will be extremely cost effective in the management of hepatitis C. Based on our discussions with Professor Aiden McCormick, the lead for the national hepatitis C treatment programme, the intention is to have a particular tailored programme for people in prison. The Deputy is quite right. One of the difficulties that bedevils us is we have a population of people in custody whose health status does not compare favourably with the general community. Therefore, taking them out to external secondary services for tertiary care is very costly in terms of the resources we need to assign, in terms of drawing staff away from prison. We are very anxious to develop any clinical services we can provide within the prison. This is one of the services we feel we can pilot successfully, it is hoped in Cork and Limerick, and extend nationally subsequently in a very cost-effective manner.</p>

Essentially, we just need to agree with our colleagues in the HSE on the treatment plan that will be rolled out for prisoners in those prisons. We ensure the prisoners who require treatment receive that treatment. We evaluate the effectiveness of it in the context of clinical care and in the context of the savings that will accrue both to the prison service in terms of escorts and to the HSE in terms of clogging up its services. I would hope that, early next year, we would seek to roll it out to all our prisons.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">I will take that. When we constructed the new prison on the site of Cork Prison, we decommissioned the old prison, so we are not maintaining that building. The accommodation in Cork Prison was the worst quality of accommodation we had within the estate before it was replaced. It had a very limited regime of activities. The new prison has been built and the old one has been decommissioned. We have not moved to demolish it because demolition would cost several million euro. It is quite expensive to demolish a building. It remains decommissioned, but obviously it is a site that could potentially be used in the future by the Prison Service.</p>

The accommodation is now of good quality. All the cells in Mountjoy are maintained as single cells, which is of significant benefit to the prison population. All of the attendant services are available on site. We have a school. We have work training activities. There are no plans in the short term for future development on the Mountjoy site. We spent some money recently on the training unit, which is also on the Mountjoy site. We had closed it in 2017 to repurpose it as an older persons' unit. Unfortunately, just as it was finished in December 2019, Covid hit and we did not think it was the right decision to put all our vulnerable elderly prisoners in that accommodation. We are moving now towards its reopening. That has been fully refurbished and decorated.</p>

          <p eId="para_536"> Turning to Vote 24, I have a number of questions on different headings and I will ask them in the time I have remaining. Subhead D3 is social disadvantage measures, and there was an underspend of nearly €1 million. Some of that was obviously down to Covid-19 but it also refers to certain projects for youth justice not being fully drawn down in 2020, related to the delays in establishing new projects.

          <p eId="para_550">That is good to know. The next two matters are linked. They are the funding for prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence as well as funding for services for victims of crime.

          <p eId="para_551">The Estimate in 2020 was €2.069 million and the outturn was €2.464 million. That excess arose due to the roll-out of the Still Here campaign. We also increased the grants available to the front-line partners we have in this space. Between the Still Here campaign for awareness raising and the increased provision for front-line services, there was approximately €400,000 extra spent in 2020.</p>

          <p eId="para_557">I welcome the officials to the committee meeting today and thank them for the information they have been providing. First, I have a brief question. In 2020, an issue under the remit of the Department of Justice that came to my attention is funding for the coroner's court. I understand there has been some difficulty with the discharge of bodies, particularly in areas where there is high population. Outside of Dublin and other areas of the country this is the remit of the local authorities, but it is the remit of the Department of Justice as it pertains to Dublin. What measures has the Department been undertaking to deal with that issue in the context, of course, of it being a deeply personal issue for many people? In Ireland we have an important tradition where the death and funeral process is very swift in comparison to what might be the case in the United Kingdom where it takes weeks. It is quite important from a cultural standpoint. I will open with that question.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_475">
          <from> Ms Oonagh McPhillips<recordedTime time="2022-04-28T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_558">The Deputy is correct. Something we were very conscious of at the beginning of the pandemic was the potential and the great unknown about how this would all play out. We established a dedicated team in March-April 2020 in respect of coroners and the pathology services generally. Obviously, the Office of the State Pathologist is under the Department. The pathologists in hospitals are under the HSE, so there can be quite a complicated provision there. I will ask Ms Buckley to comment on this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_476">
          <from> Ms Oonagh Buckley<recordedTime time="2022-04-28T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_559">There are challenges around this and they became particularly difficult during the pandemic because of the Covid-19 precautions that had to be brought to bear. Dublin also became the recipient of a lot of bodies where Covid-19 precautions had to take place so it took a bigger hit nationally, if I can put it that way, which was really unfortunate. As the Deputy said, one is always conscious of the families involved. One thing involved here is that Covid-19 deaths are natural deaths so unless there was another reason for a post-mortem they would not necessarily have undergone that.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> The other issue with this, and the Secretary General has mentioned this a few times, is that there are very specialist skills associated with doing post-mortems and so forth. It is constantly a challenge to recruit and have those skills in place to facilitate the mortuary service. The other issue is that some hospitals offer the service and depending on whether the hospitals are in a position to offer the service, that can increase or decrease the pressure on the Dublin mortuary. We had quite a significant issue in the last few weeks where a couple of hospitals had to stand down, for reasons pertaining to themselves, and the mortuary then took the hit. At one point, we were up to a delay of two weeks in post-mortems. I am pleased to tell the Deputy that as of yesterday, when I was briefed on the matter, we had only nine post-mortems outstanding. Effectively, there is currently no backlog of post-mortems in the Dublin mortuary.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> We have a specialist unit now that is concentrating on the coronial service and the mortuary service. A feature of the justice plan for this year is that we intend to look at the overall structure of the system to see how it needs to be structured for the future. Our coronial service was last properly overhauled in 1846, so we probably need to have a look at it. That is very much in our plans for the future. However, at the same time, I have a dedicated and excellent team working on making sure that the current service is maintained and supporting the Dublin coroner, who is independent, in doing her important work.</p>

          <p eId="para_566">In particular, when it happens in Dublin it impacts across the country, given the centralisation of the hospital facilities there. That is good to hear.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> I will move to a slightly more controversial matter. As part of our briefing and with regard to the State Claims Agency, there are approximately 2,400 claims outstanding in respect court cases being brought against the Irish Prison Service. Am I right that approximately €3.1 million was paid out in compensation in respect of claims by prisoners in 2020 and there was €1.5 million in compensation and €500,000 in legal costs awarded in respect of in-cell sanitation cases between 2019 and 2020?</p>
          <p eId="para_568">To me, that sounds a little unusual. I want to try to get a better understanding from the officials of what is actually going on in that particular case. Obviously, it is quite a large amount of money relating to the Prison Service. Will the officials give us the background if that is possible?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_482">
          <from> Ms Caron McCaffrey<recordedTime time="2022-04-28T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_569">I can assist the Deputy in that regard. There was a case that went as far as the Supreme Court in regard to the lack of in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy Prison. That case was allowed on appeal and damages in the sum of €7,500 were awarded. The legal costs involved in that case were very significant. The State Claims Agency manages these claims on behalf of the Prison Service. In February 2020, the State Claims Agency put in place a specific scheme to address the number of claims that had been made in this respect. To give an update on the figures, as of now 2,773 claims have been received, of which 2,040 have been concluded, so there has been very good progress in respect of that scheme. An important point to note in regard to the scheme is that damages have been capped at a maximum of €7,500. There are three different categories or levels of compensation depending on whether a person was on a restricted regime and sharing a cell, on an open regime and sharing a cell or in their own cell. Importantly, the legal costs have also been capped and that relates to the level of award that is granted. The maximum legal costs that will be paid in respect of a claim is €1,700 and the minimum for compensation awards at the lower end of the scheme is €1,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> It has been a very successful scheme. Certainly, if we look at the legal costs that were attached to the original case that was litigated in the courts, the expenditure is far less than that. The State Claims Agency at the beginning of the process in regard to in-cell sanitation claims put a contingent liability of €37.7 million against the claims. Now, because of the success of the scheme, it looks like the liability to the State will be in the order of €15 million. Therefore, the scheme that has been put in place has been very successful. There has been good engagement with both plaintiffs and their solicitors and the expectation is that that scheme will be concluded, hopefully, before the end of this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_572">A point to make is that there has been massive investment in the prison estate to bring it up to standard. Some €150 million has been invested in the last ten years to put in-cell sanitation into Mountjoy, which was the biggest facility. We now have a construction project in Limerick which will eliminate the small number who continue to not have access to an in-cell toilet. A significant amount of progress has been made.</p>

          <p eId="para_573">Thank you. I want to make one final point. The pandemic obviously brought about an enormous change in the requirements of policing in Ireland and the work the Department had to do in order to adjust to facilitate that. One observation is that I felt there was a significant rise in the level of substance use by younger members of society in Ireland, which is extraordinarily concerning to me, particularly when it comes to the use of what we would consider class A drugs, such as cocaine, among young members of society. I am hearing about a lot of usage by teenagers and this has been reported to me through my constituency office. This is extremely concerning.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> I want to put on record that this is something we need to try to get some degree of control over. I do not wish to put across the position that this can be eliminated and, obviously, it cannot be. However, it is the case, unfortunately, that drug use is rampant in Ireland, particularly among younger members of society. While that is a topic of much debate, when it comes to more serious drugs it is a huge concern. The Department has to try to find more useful ways and, instead of trying to put people in prison, to try to guide young people away from substance abuse and drug use. It needs to find more proactive ways of getting people off the streets and away from dealing drugs. That is very important. We need to re-evaluate this through education programmes, rather than the stick approach, which, unfortunately, is not working.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> Gardaí are under immense pressure and finding it very difficult to deal with gang-related crime, which has been an issue in Ireland over a long number of years. I want to make the point to the Department, the Secretary General, the assistant secretary general and all of the officials here that we have a lot of work to do to prevent people from ending up in prison and in situations of addiction. Unfortunately, from what I have seen and what I have heard through my office, this is a huge problem that is going to have huge knock-on consequences for people's mental health and the growth and development of young people in Ireland in general.</p>

          <p eId="para_576">I would endorse that absolutely. The Department is a very active participant in the national drugs strategy that is led by the Department of Health. That health-led approach is something we are very committed to and the Garda probably outlined to the committee its increased use of the adult caution scheme in regard to this, rather than criminalising people. Obviously, gardaí enforce this area very strictly in regard to large-scale importation and so forth. They have had a lot of success over the last couple of years and I am sure recent events will help to support that. In terms of street-level activity and young people, the health-led approach is something we are completely committed to.</p>

There is a view under the Istanbul Convention as to how many beds, what distance and all that kind of thing. When it comes down to the practice, it is not 100% as straightforward as that.

          <p eId="para_587">It is a huge problem in the nine counties, and Laois and Offaly are the counties I am most familiar with. When victims of domestic violence leave, often taking children with them, they are sent 60 or 70 miles away across two or three counties to a refuge. Their children are taken away from schools, from social workers and, very importantly, from family support, the GP and all other services. It creates chaos, and that is the only way I can describe it. It is making it difficult for people to leave those situations. Even in genuine cases of domestic violence, unfortunately, victims often make their way back, hoping things will change. There is always that hope.</p>

Offaly has a different plan, by the way, although I do not want to go into it in detail. Offaly has a plan that involves three locations and it is trying to operate a different system for domestic violence. That is the plan going forward and it has been shared with me. Nonetheless, we badly need one refuge for the two counties of Laois and Offaly.</p>

It is a clear audit opinion, but I draw attention to disclosures in the statement on internal financial control relating to the level of resourcing of internal audit and to non-compliance with procurement rules.

          <p eId="para_610">On section A, the matter I wish to raise follows on from our meeting with the officials from the Department of Justice and the Irish Prison Service this morning. The responses to my questions on the Shane O'Farrell case were very frustrating. The Secretary General of the Department of Justice indicated a number of times that she could not comment on the questions I was asking because, if I am correct, a statutory inquiry was ongoing. There is no statutory inquiry; there is a scoping inquiry that has no statutory powers whatsoever. The Secretary General indicated on a number of occasions that she would provide some written responses, but this committee should have a view on expenditure on trying to find ways to avoid delivering a public inquiry into this matter that is obviously necessary. In the follow-up correspondence, will the secretariat make that point and ask for full information? Will it also ask the Department, following on from the completion of the scoping inquiry, which we hope will be sooner rather than later, to give the timeframe it envisages if a public inquiry is initiated? What is the timeframe for the establishment of such an inquiry?</p>

          <p eId="para_612">The questions I asked were not related to the scoping inquiry at all, but the scoping inquiry was cited as a reason answers possibly could not be given. I do not buy that. The questions will be on the record. The Secretary General indicated on a number of occasions that she may provide a note of the matter. As well as asking for the information, we should point out that the scoping inquiry should not be a reason not to answer the questions. Second, could we get a view from the Secretary General on the timeframe for establishing a public inquiry if one is to be established?</p>

          <p eId="para_613">We can come back to that once we get a response. Correspondence group B comprises correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers following up on meetings of this committee. No. 1147B, from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, dated 24 March 2022, provides information requested by the committee regarding remuneration for the CEO of Horse Racing Ireland. Is it agreed to note and publish it? Agreed. Before opening the matter to the floor, I will address the next flagged because the two are related.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> No. 1149B, from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 25 March 2022, also provides information requested by the committee regarding the remuneration of the new CEO of Horse Racing Ireland.

          <p eId="para_615">Again, the correspondence does not provide the clarity required. It appears to me that the justification for a salary above the scale previously set down was justified from a business case presented by Horse Racing Ireland itself. The new CEO was appointed before the new salary was approved. I would love to know what would have happened if the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had not approved the new salary. Would the CEO have stepped down? If not, there would have been no need for the increased salary in the first place. It is public money. I do not know whether we can secure a route to assert whether the salary was justified and necessary and represented value for money. Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General could point us in the direction we need to go to seek clarification. I am aware representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be before us shortly. Perhaps that is the best avenue but I am open to direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_616">Was the application process open to a wide group of people, including people from other jurisdictions? Did NewERA advise on recruiting or was it just on the salary?</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> Another issue arose over a car that was declined. I believe this pertains to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We need to make inquiries into what transpired. A salary is one thing but an overall package is entirely different. What happened? It is a bit too open-ended for my liking.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> The second last paragraph on the second page of the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform states that, in line with the statutory remit referenced, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine sought an independent assessment by NewERA of the remuneration proposed by Horse Racing Ireland. Following its assessment of the proposal of Horse Racing Ireland, NewERA recommended that the proposed salary of €190,773 be approved. It appears that the basis for this seems to have been the salary of the outgoing person and that there is established custom and practice in relation to that. That actually raises another issue, concerning, for example, the salary scales of the Secretaries General and the deviation. Is what I am referring to a standard now? The response is coming from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Where there is a deviation, is it now going to be the basis for why a salary should commence at a particular level, that of the previous incumbent? For example, if the Secretary General of the Department of Health moved out of that role and somebody else moved in, would that person’s salary represent the standard set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform? I would like some clarification on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_620">What happened, according to freedom of information, FOI, releases I have received, was that NewERA effectively reviewed a business case that was provided to it by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which in turn was provided to it by Horse Racing Ireland. As I said, there are then other questions because the appointment had been made prior to the formal approval being granted. As Deputy Catherine Murphy rightly said, these decisions can subsequently be used as justification for future decisions, so it is important we pursue this issue to find out how exactly we arrived at this point. It does not appear to be the type of robust analysis we would expect of NewERA.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">I will make just a couple of observations on the points raised. Regarding the car, I think what was applied for was a car allowance, which, effectively, would be a payment made to the chief executive as part of his or her salary, and there would be benefit-in-kind taxation of the allowance, but that was declined. What was agreed was that a company car would be provided, presumably on the basis that this person would be travelling around to racecourses and so on. That was that aspect of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> NewERA is part of the NTMA and has a specific focus to advise Departments on commercial State bodies and issues that arise in that regard. Its role, therefore, was to examine the case that was made regarding the salary and to express a view on it. Because NewERA is part of the NTMA, it has a role that can be examined by the committee when it has the NTMA before it to explore a little more what it does, the nature of the advice it gives, how it arrives at its conclusions and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Finally, my understanding is that when a pay level is determined, it is determined in relation to the post and not in relation to the individual. The example given was the Secretary General of the Department of Health. Anybody filling that post will attract that salary. It was not a salary determination for an individual. Similarly, here, it was, I think, the lower salary scale that was originally approved in, let us say, 2012 or whatever. It was never applied. The application was, effectively, to revise the pay rate for the role to the higher level. That was agreed, or at least recommended, by NewERA and approved by the Ministers.</p>

          <p eId="para_637">You forgot about me. I wanted to flag this correspondence, particularly because it relates to previous correspondence and engagement with RTÉ, specifically No. R1198B from the Department of Social Protection. It is about bogus self-employment and RTE workers' cases. I do not feel the Department of Social Protection's related correspondence adequately addresses our question as to why it cannot provide interim updates on the outcomes of those cases where a decision has not been reached. That is very clear in its correspondence. I suspect it might relate to the fact that it has been reported that RTÉ is appealing those decisions that have gone against it to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. I would see that as a way of delaying justice for those concerned by up to six months. From our engagements with RTÉ and the reports in the media, I still find it bizarre that RTÉ has committed to back pay of up to only four years and-----</p>

          <p eId="para_639">Yes, but the two items are tied in with RTÉ. RTÉ has committed to back pay of up to only four years and nothing at all in respect of holiday pay or pension contributions. I do not see how it could get away with that. I know the Chairman has referred to the other correspondence, but could we write to both the Department of Social Protection and RTÉ to ask them both whether RTÉ has appealed every single case that went against it or just a handful of cases? We should have been getting those interim updates because there seems to be a lack of understanding that RTÉ exploited these workers. I for one would not accept Ms Forbes's assertion that this is a legacy issue because RTÉ continues to deny these workers their entitlements by unnecessarily prolonging the process. My big fear is that if these cases end up in court, I have no doubt but that a future director general of RTÉ will tell a future Committee of Public Accounts that spiralling legal costs are a legacy matter. That may well be Ms Forbes's legacy. Can we write to both and ask-----</p>

I know databases go out of date if one does not continue to populate them but is there a role for retrieving some of the information that was there? It was very well used.

There is a world of difference between second-hand electric vehicles and other second-hand vehicles. If one buys a second-hand petrol car with 60,000 miles on the clock, one will have a rough idea of the lifespan of the car but if one buys an electric vehicle, the battery is the issue. It is very expensive to replace. It seems that targets are being set at national level in the context of our climate obligations but it is then stated that it is a market function. Maybe the committee should write to the Department of Finance regarding the vehicle registration tax, VRT, implications in respect of second-hand electric vehicles. There will be implications in that regard in the context of reaching our targets and the policy. That will obviously have an implication in the context of fines and all sorts of things.</p>

          <p eId="para_671">We had the Department in this morning. Let us see what comes back in relation to the note they said that they would provide and we can come back on it then.</p>

          <p eId="para_673">It was not acceptable this morning. One could have this crazy scenario in order to avoid any questions on a particular line of expenditure that one would simply move it to another Department and then no historical questions can be asked because the new Department says that was historical and the old one says it can no longer answer questions in relation to that because it has moved.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> It appears that these issues of emergency accommodation are arising all the time. The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, in the new Department that is dealing with these areas, confirmed in the Dáil today that the catering firm Aramark has been given a contract to provide meals to Ukrainian refugees and that there has been no procurement process employed at all. That raises a red flag to me. Every time there is an emergency and there are poor people in difficulty someone manages to make a lot of money out of it and there are always question marks in respect of the process employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> In respect of this correspondence, I suggest that we write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requesting whether or not it has evaluated this move on the part of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and whether it has a view on this contract. We should seek from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth the full details of the contract - the timeframe, the money involved and the safeguards that have been put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> It strikes me that it is never a set of local catering companies that get these contracts. It is always huge corporations and in this instance, one that has had a lot of question marks with regard to previous ones.</p>

The proposed action is to note and publish it and to forward the Department's response, along with the correspondence that gave rise to it, which was R0947, to the Joint Committee on Health for its information and any action it may deem appropriate.

          <p eId="para_681">This correspondence has raised an issue of significant concern in that the response of the Department seems to substantiate in particular the idea that high level civil servants would not have to declare gifts of as much as €2,500 in relation to travel, accommodation and meals. I note the Department had made specific reference to legislation by Deputies O'Rourke and Cullinane that would seek to address the issue. I suggest the most appropriate follow-up by this committee might be to refer it to the Joint Committee on Health.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">They are making it clear that they want time to complete. I completely understand Deputy Munster's frustration and the frustration of the employees who have waited a very long time. It is not only a question of recognising the other issues, such as holiday and other entitlements and backdating some of what was found. I am not sure the Scope section, at the same time, can give us an interim report. They are pretty much saying that they are not going to.</p>

          <p eId="para_687"> We would not benefit from a piecemeal approach. On proper updates, I am comfortable with what they are proposing here in terms of that particular Department's role in this because it is a serious review. If it was coming from Revenue, that would be the view we would take as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_689">I will not go through it all again. I propose that the committee write to both RTÉ and the Department of Social Protection to ask has RTÉ appealed every case that went against it or is it only a handful of cases where there are technical issues or whatever. It would be interesting to know from both because the Department's response might be related to the fact that RTÉ is appealing and prolonging shamefully the issue for the workers. It would be no harm writing to both to find that out.</p>

I suggest that we seek that clarification as to whether the case of each person who is employed by RTÉ on a contract basis was examined.</p>

          <p eId="para_696">This is another one that you pull the hair out of your head with. First, I find the position of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, on this matter utterly lacking in substance of explanation. They told us in December that they would be ready to start installing the CCTVs in January, the beginning of the new season, and that was New Year's Day.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">It was stated that it would take six weeks. Now we are informed that it could take almost six months. That is another four or five months. That beggars belief, particularly when we think of the benefits that CCTV monitoring would have for the industry and, more importantly, those tasked with regulating it. We cannot help but wonder why there is delay after delay. It raises more questions than answers. It is very frustrating that each time we ask for an update, we are told it is happening. It is being kicked further and further down the road, however. I ask that we request a further update by June. I hope I am proved wrong, but I suspect the board will kick this further down the road for reasons best known to itself at this stage.</p>

Can we ask the Department of Health what has been expended to date, including on the design? We have been waiting since 2018. There was the Mulvey report. There are very serious concerns about ownership and control of the national maternity hospital.

          <p eId="para_730">I thank the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> No. 1211C is correspondence from me requesting the committee to write to the Department of Health in relation to the now abandoned secondment or redeployment, whichever it is, of the Chief Medical Officer to Trinity College Dublin. In the letter I set out that the committee would write to the Department of Health to request further information on the proposed appointment or secondment of Dr. Tony Holohan to Trinity College and that the information would include how the decision was made, who made the decision, who was involved in the decision-making, what was the expected salary and expenses and what were the total expenses in terms of offices and any secretarial backup or anything else. It would also include the total cost involved for the Department over the period of five years and what official processes and guidelines the Department has transfers and secondments. Since the matter became one of public interest, the issue of processes and guidelines to which the Department operates is crucial. I am not clear about it and I do not know whether anybody else on the committee is clear about it. It is important that we do this. If the committee agrees we will request it from the Department of Health. Is that agreed? Agreed. The Department will come before the committee in the near future and that will also provide an opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> No other items of correspondence have been flagged for consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> With regard to our work programme, the following engagements are confirmed for May. We will have the Department of Finance on 5 May, University of Limerick on 12 May, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 May and, as I mentioned, the Department of Health on 26 May. I will set out some proposals for June and then open the floor to members. As 2 June falls in a non-sitting week, the next available date is 9 June. I propose that we schedule a meeting with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on that date. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2022-04-28T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_734">Can we flag that we will return to the Aramark contract with it on that occasion?</p>

          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2022-04-28T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_735">Procurement generally will need to be discussed with it at the meeting. It is on the work programme and responsibility for direct provision now resides with that Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> I also propose that we schedule an engagement with the National Pediatric Hospital Development Board in June, with representatives from the Department of Health. The board was last before the committee in July last year when we examined its 2019 financial statements. Is it agreed that we schedule this engagement? Agreed. It is very frustrating that we are denied the information we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> Before Easter, we agreed to examine local government oversight and accountability. I suggest that we also look at this in June. With the agreement of members we will consider how we might approach this when we meet next. Is that agreed? Agreed. We have had some discussion about who we want to come before the committee. There are a number of parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> Other bodies on the work programme include the Department of Education regarding the special report on education and training boards. There is also the Central Bank and Revenue Commissioners on the outstanding chapter on assessment and collection of insurance compensation fund levies. There is also Horse Racing Ireland and the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">If there are any other matters members wish to raise, they can put them forward now or at the next meeting. As usual, we will run it through like that. Members can let the clerk know. If there are any specific issues regarding any of the groups coming in over the next month, members can let the clerk know so we can put them on the agenda and notify the guests of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> That concludes consideration of the work programme for today. The last item on the public agenda for today is any other business. Does any member wish to raise anything?</p>

          <p eId="para_741">On 31 January, the committee wrote to the Secretary General of the Department of Health seeking clarification regarding the exact period of time for which he waived remuneration for his current post. We did not receive any response. We wrote again on 8 April and that question was put again. I propose that we write again requesting that information. I remind the committee that this information related to the waiving of the substantial increase in salary allocated to the post. A public statement was made by the Secretary General on his appointment to the role on a permanent basis that he was waiving that portion of his salary. The public and this committee have a right to know for how long that took place, bearing in mind that whatever portion he did not take was available to the Department for other purposes. I propose that, following the meeting, we write again and continue to seek that information.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">We had a discussion around that with the Secretary General and we are not clear. If it is agreed by the committee, we will request that.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> We have to go into private session for a few minutes before adjourning until next Thursday, 5 May, when we will examine the Department of Finance's 2020 appropriation accounts and two chapters of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2020.</p>
