            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Kathleen Funchion</b> asked the <b>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth</b> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that more than a small number of childcare sessional and school-age childcare, SAC, services will be adversely affected by the newly announced core funding model; the guarantees he can give these services that they will not be worse off; if the staff working in these services can avail of the uplift; if not, the reason that they do not qualify; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2">Good morning to the Minister. Is he aware that more than a small number of childcare sessional and SAC services will be adversely affected by the newly announced core funding model? Will he give a guarantee that they will not be worse off? Will he confirm that staff working in these services can avail of the uplift? If not, why do they not qualify?</p>

            <from>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (Deputy Roderic O'Gorman)<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T09:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">I thank the Deputy. A transformative package of measures for the early learning and care, ELC, and SAC sectors was announced in budget 2022, including €221 million in core funding. Core funding will operate from September in order to support improved quality, affordability and sustainability. The significant majority of ELC and SAC services will see substantial increases in income through core funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> It is important to state that no service will lose out on core funding. All services will receive at least the same level of core funding as they received from higher capitation and programme support payments, PSPs, this year, assuming the number of children, graduate staff and type of service offered remain the same. For early childhood care and education, ECCE, sessional services operating with standard capitation, all full- and part-time services and all SAC services, there will be substantial increases in funding. There will also be increases in funding for the large majority of ECCE sessional services operating with higher capitation. Approximately 1% of services will see the same income from core funding as they received this year through higher capitation and PSPs combined but no service will be less well off under core funding than under the previous scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> Core funding is largely contingent on an employment regulation order, ERO, being agreed by the joint labour committee, JLC, for the sector. If agreed, an ERO will establish minimum rates of pay and conditions for all workers and it is a matter for the JLC to determine whether different rates should apply for different roles and qualification levels of staff. A JLC was established this year and has been meeting regularly in recent months.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pauline Tully<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T09:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_6">I thank the Minister. We are acutely aware of issues in the childcare sectors in recent years, including the cost of childcare to parents and staff not being paid at levels appropriate to their qualifications. I acknowledge that many services will be better off and welcome the uplift to 49 weeks instead of 38 weeks for degree staff. I know it is rolled out as part of the budget and will come on stream later this year. However, a few services have been in touch with Deputy Funchion's office to say they will be worse off. They have gone on to the ready reckoner, which is the online tool for services, to gauge the potential funding value for an individual service and found they will be worse off. The Minister has given a guarantee that they will not be. If they find they do not qualify for the core funding, can they engage with the Department to ensure they get the same level of funding as last year? The sessional services are particularly fearful that they will be worse off.</p>

            <p eId="para_7">Owing to the manner in which the higher capitation payment was made in respect of graduates when it was based on the number of children participating in the ECCE programme rather than the number of hours of graduate-led provision, approximately 1% of sessional services got a disproportionate uplift under the older system. When they put their numbers into the ready reckoner, they came out as being down slightly. I can give a clear guarantee. We have conveyed this to the services but this is a valuable opportunity to state that no service will be less well off for core funding than under the previous arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> In the coming days we will communicate with all services about the transition payment, which is the payment we will provide to them when the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, ends but before core funding kicks in, hopefully in September. That transition payment will be made in June, July or August and we will issue information about it in the coming days.</p>

            <p eId="para_9">The Minister mentioned an interim period and that the JLC is meeting regularly. I am concerned that funding is still reliant on the employment regulation order. Does the Minister have concerns about that? Is he confident that everything will work out as intended?</p>

            <p eId="para_10">We are bringing forward €221 million per year in funding. This is a significant State investment, as everyone recognises. The bulk of that money is linked to the delivery of the ERO. We all know how poorly childcare professionals are paid. I see, Government sees and it is seen across the House the ERO as the means to deliver that. That money has to be contingent on the ERO. If we do not get the ERO, we cannot get the guarantee that the extra money the State is providing to services will go to childcare providers, give them the uplift they need and deserve and keep them in the sector so they do not continue to leave as they are leaving at the moment. The Government sees the ERO as essential to the delivery of that objective and that is why it is so closely linked with the provision of the majority of the core funding package.</p>

            <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T09:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. I am aware of various organisations making calls for safeguarding and child protection measures to be put in place for children fleeing Ukraine. Tusla has a significant role in the State's response to support individuals, particularly women and children, displaced from Ukraine as a result of the war and coming into Ireland. Tusla is committed to balancing the needs of families in a humanitarian crisis with its child protection responsibilities and requirement to support families and promote the welfare of children.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> Where children enter Ireland and present to emigration authorities as separated children seeking international protection, Tusla's specialist separated children social work team attend the airport or port to meet with the young person to undertake an assessment, supported as required by relevant translators. If the individual is deemed to be a separated child, the social worker will, in the first instance, see if the child can be reunited with his or her family. If it is assessed that the child needs care, he or she will be received into State care under section 4 of the Child Care Act 1991 and placed in foster care or specialised residential care. Where an immigration official has a concern about the welfare and safety of a child travelling with adults who are not his or her parents, that official will contact Tusla, which will assess the situation. Between 16 and 21 March of this year, Tusla received 22 referrals of separated children from Ukraine. A number of these were subsequently reunited with family members; as such, as of 22 March, Tusla had 13 separated children in State care. Where an individual has any child protection concerns, a referral should be made to Tusla.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">In responding to any child protection concerns, Tusla's staff have access to translators, as required, and the translation of key information on the <i>tusla.ie</i> website is under way. The Government website, <i>gov.ie/ukraine</i>, already contains much information that has already been translated into Ukrainian and Russian.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">I welcome the Minister's response. I am concerned that there have been 22 referrals, but I am reassured that a designated social worker team has been assigned. Can the Minister indicate if such teams are assigned at all points of entry? There has been much talk about Dublin and Rosslare, but Ukrainian people are, to a lesser extent, coming in through Shannon and Cork airports. I wish to seek assurance that similar teams are being put in place at those points of entry as well.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RodericOGorman" eId="spk_10" as="#Minister_for_Children,_Equality,_Disability,_Integration_and_Youth">
            <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_17">A team is on-site 18 hours a day at Dublin Airport. Between 85% and 90% of all Ukrainians who have come to Ireland have entered through Dublin Airport. At this stage, we do not have on-site teams at Rosslare, which is the next largest entry point, or at Shannon and the other points of entry that account for small numbers. It is a question of where to best target resources. In the coming weeks and months as the summer season approaches, it is likely that more people may be entering and particularly through Rosslare. As the Deputy is aware, a full hub is being established at Rosslare now, so I have no doubt that Tusla will examine that aspect. The organisation can designate and send a specialist team wherever it is required. My understanding, however, is that the majority of these 22 referrals have come in through Dublin Airport. It is important to reiterate that there have been 22 referrals, but 13 are in care. A significant number have been reunited with their families or family members, which is a positive development.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_18">The important thing for all of us is that children are being picked up by the system. That is the most important thing because it would reassure us.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> I pay tribute to the people of Buttevant in my native Cork, who wrapped their arms around approximately 50 Ukrainians who have come into the community there in recent days. Communities are rallying to support families and the effort there has been tremendous. If we were looking for a model of community response, the Buttevant experience would be an excellent exemplar for such a model. The Department of Social Protection and other statutory agencies are beginning to respond to the needs of people in Buttevant. I take that town as an example of other similar communities throughout the country. I ask that Tusla would make itself known to those types of efforts to ensure that where children need psychological services, for example, that such needs would be picked up, even where those children are accompanied by parents or family.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RodericOGorman" eId="spk_12" as="#Minister_for_Children,_Equality,_Disability,_Integration_and_Youth">
            <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">Tusla is acutely aware of its responsibility in this matter, particularly because this is a crisis having such a detrimental impact on children. Bernard Gloster was on "Morning Ireland" this morning. I did not catch his interview, but he has been in regular contact with me and my Department on these issues. As the Deputy said, we and Tusla have moved quickly to address the situation of the 22 children referred to. The Ukrainian authorities have also written to us on the broader issue of the use of adoption during a wartime situation and to ensure that wartime is not used as an opportunity for adoption laws to be taken advantage of. We will be sending a strong official response to say that we recognise that that is the case. The protection of children is, therefore, very much a focus. I have several other questions on Ukraine later and I can probably use those opportunities to outline more details in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> I join with Deputy Sherlock in paying tribute to the great work being done in his constituency and communities all over the country. I had an opportunity to see some of the amazing work being done in Blanchardstown yesterday. The national effort is absolutely spectacular.</p>

            <p eId="para_25">I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> Following the publication of the independent review into illegal birth registrations in March 2021, I asked Professor Conor O'Mahony, the special rapporteur on child protection, to consider the significant complexities and challenges which arise in respect of the issue of illegal birth registrations and to provide a report proposing an appropriate course of action. On 14 March 2022, I published the report, which sets out 17 numbered recommendations, one of which is that a State inquiry into illegal adoption should be established. On publication, the Government was able to commit to the implementation of a significant number of the recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> The question of creating an effective non-statutory inquiry is a sensitive, complex and challenging one. The special rapporteur on child protection acknowledged this and, in particular, noted the challenges associated with access to records for a non-statutory inquiry. The Government remains committed to delivering on that comprehensive suite of actions set out in the Government action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions. These actions respond to the priority needs and wishes of survivors, their families and advocates. As part of this work, I am advancing an initiative for the recognition and memorialisation of the voices and lived experiences of survivors. This will establish a process for survivors of mother and baby and county home institutions to allow them to come forward voluntarily and share the account of their lived experiences, with a view to having those formally recognised as a part of the official record of the history of these institutions in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> The Government action plan also contains important measures focused on access to records and the creation of a centralised State repository of records. The Government recognises the potential for a future centralised archive to support future analysis and research on these important matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> As a consequence of this ongoing work, the Government will need to give further consideration to the specific recommendation on the truth commission. In the coming months, my priority will be to implement the action plan and to deliver the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022, which will provide full, unredacted access to birth and early life information for people affected by illegal birth registrations, adopted people and anyone with questions as to their origins.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> Regarding the specific question concerning the €3,000 once-off payment and whether that will be applicable to other institutions and-or persons, my aim in bringing forward this payment is to respond to the recommendations of the special rapporteur on child protection in the timeliest manner possible. For this reason, I have received Government approval for a once-off payment for those individuals affected by illegal birth registration in the files of St. Patrick's Guild, where confirmation is already held by Tusla and can form the basis for payment to the individuals affected, without any need to bring forward evidence and meet a certain burden of proof. There may be potential to extend the payment to other confirmed cases after the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 has provided access to records and, as a result, people with suspicions are able to access the evidence necessary to confirm illegal birth registration and consequently effect a change in the birth register.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pauline Tully<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_31">We have had two significant exposés of illegal adoptions recently, namely, the "RTÉ Investigates" follow-up programme on illegal adoption practices in the State and then the report from Professor Conor O'Mahony's into the State's response to illegal birth registrations. Tusla is still putting obstacles in the way of some people seeking information in this regard. We saw in the follow-up programme to the original broadcast that obstacles still exist. These reports were both damning and they showed that the State had a significant role in facilitating these practices and now has a role in correcting and repairing past injustices.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> Professor O'Mahony's report, as the Minister said, contains 17 recommendations. We welcome confirmation that the State will make an apology. It will go some way to amending some of the human rights violations in this context. We need more clarity, however, concerning what form this inquiry will take. I have reservations if there is no accountability, because people would again be left extremely disappointed. We must be aware that many of the people involved are aged and getting older. While we have known about these practices for approximately 70 years, there is still a need for answers.</p>
            <p eId="para_33">We cannot have another report like the one relating to the mother and baby homes, and we are mindful that we cannot wait another seven years for an inquiry.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">I really hoped this would be one of the topics on which we could all agree and that after all the human rights violations and mistreatment by the State, we would do the right thing immediately and set up this inquiry. The special rapporteur's recommendations and rationale are incredibly clear and compelling. We all know many adopted people could not participate in the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes; not only were they denied the right to tell their story in a State inquiry but as a result, the Taoiseach's apology did not even include them. Each and every one of them deserves the opportunity to contribute to an official State inquiry that would record the abuses they suffered and their impact. Instead, it seems we are offering a possible lesser process and we have another Government that does not consider their suffering worthy of a proper and full recognition. Will the Government establish the inquiry immediately on the system of illegal adoptions and that legacy?</p>

            <p eId="para_35">I thank the Deputies. There has been a rightful focus on the question of illegal birth registration through "RTÉ Investigates" programmes and the published report of the independent investigator. Following on from that, the Government and I took action, recognising that the independent reviewer's report, comprehensive though it was, perhaps did not set out clear next steps. We asked Professor Conor O'Mahony to bring forward his report and he has set out clear next steps. He recognises the importance of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022, on which so much work has been done in recent weeks, in answering many of the issues and resolving many of the barriers mentioned by Deputy Tully. I acknowledge they still exist with respect to access to information but the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 will address them. It has been designed specifically so those subject to illegal birth registrations and particularly those who suspect they are the subject of illegal birth registrations may use the processes set out in that Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_36">I acknowledge that work has been done and that under the guidance of the Minister, matters have progressed much more than they had under his predecessors. It is important to say an inquiry is needed that would not go on for years and cost millions of euro. It must get answers and hold people to account for what happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> The Minister has indicated the €3,000 one-off payment is going to people from St. Patrick's Guild and there is a possibility that process will be opened to others. It is only a possibility at this stage and that depends on information that will come forward. Is that right?</p>

            <p eId="para_40">The Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 will not address this. Adopted people and their advocates have been calling for an inquiry for decades and the special rapporteur has unambiguously supported that. We need an inquiry straight away and nothing less; for too long people have had to settle for less. It should not be the case any more.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> We need a full and proper inquiry that fulfils all the functions of a truth commission and the principles of transitional justice. That is what is being recommended. Responding to the "RTÉ Investigates" programme on illegal adoptions, Professor O'Mahony stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_42">I am struck once more by the shattering impact that illegal birth registrations have had on the lives of those affected. We owe them everything that can realistically be done without further delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">The vast majority of Irish people agree with this and it is disgraceful that the Government does not. State bodies and officials seem determined to prevent a full inquiry so will the Minister please do the right thing and set up the inquiry immediately?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RodericOGorman" eId="spk_22" as="#Minister_for_Children,_Equality,_Disability,_Integration_and_Youth">
            <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T09:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_44">Deputy Cairns is correct about the comprehensive nature of Professor O'Mahony's discussion of the issue of inquiry. He very clearly took task with the commission of investigation model, and we all agree it did not deliver what survivors of institutions were seeking. Deputy Tully spoke about accountability. One of the key issues with a truth commission is that it requires people to come forward on a non-statutory basis. As a result, what everybody seeks to achieve from an inquiry may not be delivered from a truth commission model as opposed to a commission of inquiry model, although we have already seen how the commission of inquiry model does not deliver either.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> Considering how to go forward in a way that delivers for the desires of survivors is important, and it is why we cannot just immediately say that we are following this course of action. This requires consideration. The completion of major work like the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 is so important in addressing other elements of Professor O'Mahony's report and providing people who have suspicions that they were subject to illegal birth registration with confirmation either way.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">In 2018, the Crowe consultancy group was commissioned by my Department to undertake a sustainability review of a small cohort of early learning and care and school-age childcare services operating in disadvantaged areas. Through this review, Crowe also engaged with parents using these services. A key objective of the review was to examine the potential impact of the national childcare scheme, NCS, which was under development at the time. It was never intended to publish a report of this sustainability review as it contains commercially-sensitive data relating to the services that participated.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> All recommendations emerging from the steering group overseeing the sustainability review were adopted and implemented in full by my Department. This includes an increase in standard NCS-subsidised hours from 15 hours to 20 hours per week, which was introduced in September 2019 and an increase in enhanced NCS subsidised hours from 40 to 45 hours per week, which was also introduced in September 2019. The recommendations also included a continuation of and enhancement to sustainability funding to ELC and SAC services, which remains in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> Since I became Minister, and following my engagements with childcare providers across the country, further consideration has been given to the early learning and care and school-age childcare services needs of children from disadvantaged areas, once the NCS, including NCS sponsorship arrangements, were introduced. In this context, arising from a review of the NCS that I specifically asked to consider disadvantaged services, a review of the work study test and recommendations set out in Partnership for the Public Good, a number of changes to NCS were announced in budget 2022. Significantly, these included the discontinuation of the practice of deducting hours in preschool or school from NCS subsidy hours. This measure will benefit an estimated 5,000 children in disadvantaged areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> Other recommendations in Partnership for the Public Good will further support services operating in disadvantaged areas. We discussed earlier that Core funding, which will be introduced in September, has been designed to meet objectives with this in mind.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">In the Department's 12-month review of the NCS, there is a paragraph that mentions this in-depth review that nobody in the sector has seen or even knew about. Did that review find that seven of the 13 services would move into financial deficit with the introduction of the NCS? Did it find that funding from these schemes constituted a major share of the services' revenues? Will the Minister confirm if many of the parents receiving community childcare subvention programme, a very high proportion of whom are unemployed, now receive fewer hours of subsidised childcare under the NCS? Did the Department know this and still go ahead with these changes, knowing children would be adversely affected?</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> The Association of Childhood Professionals published a report in November 2019 indicating that 50% of school-age children on the community childcare subvention programme would be entitled to NCS and 30% of early childhood education and care children on the community childcare subvention programme would be entitled to fewer hours and funding. We recognise and welcome that in budget 2022 the Department extended the universal NCS subvention to all children up to 15 and stopped the practice, as mentioned by the Minister, of counting hours spent in school and the ELC and education scheme with respect to a family's entitlement. This does not go far enough, however, to adequately address disadvantage. Will the Minister confirm such disadvantage will be addressed in budget 2023?</p>

            <p eId="para_54">From very early in taking up my role, I recognised that the NCS as a national scheme is extremely beneficial. We have very clear evidence that on a national basis it is providing real benefits to large numbers of parents and encouraging large numbers of those parents back to work. However, we recognised that specific services felt a negative impact and I engaged with the Deputy's colleagues about that. I also met representatives from a significant number of services and listened to them and that is why we brought forward these changes in the budget to broaden the NCS and, in particular, to remove the wrap-around hours. I also worked with Tusla and other bodies to make the sponsorship process easier.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> We have been very clear in the Partnership for the Public Good report, and there is a clear indication that, a form of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, approach to childcare is needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">My Department as well as working on core funding is also working on designing that DEIS-type approach. We hope to begin the process of rolling it out in the next budgetary cycle.</p>

            <p eId="para_57">Prior the launch of the national childcare scheme, NCS, those working in the sector warned the previous Minister and the Department of the effect it would have on services in disadvantaged areas. It seems the report did justify their concerns. I would be concerned about children. Just because parents are unemployed and at home does not mean children do not need childcare. It may be the only hot meal they get in the day. They need supports from services like this, especially when they are in disadvantaged areas. It is extremely important. The Minister is confirming that this will be addressed in budget 2023.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">I very much recognise the needs of children from disadvantaged areas. That is why we have made changes to the scheme. We have made it clear that sponsorship should be interpreted broadly, particularly by Tusla. That has led to a significant increase in the number of children getting full hours through the sponsorship process. We also removed the wraparound hours, which will benefit 5,000 children. It is my hope that in next year's budget we will be able to begin to advance the DEIS measures. The Government has committed to the implementation of the public good document and the DEIS model is a key element of that. Obviously it is part of the budgetary cycle and something my Department has to go in and advocate for. We are not going to be able to introduce it fully in one budgetary cycle. I very much believe that a DEIS model, as is advised by that report, is crucial to supporting services in areas of vulnerability and that is a key priority for me.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (Deputy Roderic O'Gorman)<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_77">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 13, 19, 30, 50, 65, 72, 73, 298 and 306 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> I thank the Deputies for their questions. I am sure everyone joins me in condemning in the strongest possible terms the illegal aggression of Russia towards Ukraine, which at this stage appears to be designed to create the most possible suffering for civilians. I am sure all Deputies will join with me in extending a hand of welcome to Ukrainian refugees as they arrive in our country.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> Since the outset of the Russian attack, I and my Department have been focused on providing reception accommodation for Ukrainian refugees in need. From 25 February to this Tuesday,19 March, 10,414 Ukrainians have come to Ireland. We have established dedicated teams at Dublin Airport to meet new arrivals from Ukraine, with teams from the Departments of Social Protection, Health, and Justice and from my own Department. Alongside that we have hubs in Cork and Limerick cities to support new arrivals. We are establishing a hub presence at Rosslare Port. Officials from these Departments are ensuring that every person arriving is met and given support as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> We have specifically prepared reception areas and they include designated spaces for children and adults and quiet spaces. The international protection accommodation service, IPAS, of my Department has temporarily taken responsibility for providing accommodation to Ukrainian refugees. A dedicated Ukraine unit is being established to manage the provision of accommodation and related services to Ukrainian refugees. To date almost 5,000 Ukraine nationals have sought accommodation from IPAS.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> My officials are continuously working to source further accommodation and supports for Ukrainian arrivals to Ireland. So far, IPAS has contracted over 2,500 hotel rooms, with additional capacity also being pursued through accommodation pledged by the general public, where there are 20,000 pledges on the register; State-owned or private properties which may be suitable for short-term accommodation; religious properties; and local authority facilities. My Department has worked with local authorities which played a pivotal role in securing short-term accommodation. We have engaged with the City and County Management Association, CCMA, about drawing on emergency accommodation in community centres, if necessary. Dublin City Council provided some emergency accommodation last weekend and we have engaged with convention centres about installing emergency accommodation in those facilities and with the Defence Forces about options if existing capacity was insufficient.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> All of this work is being undertaken. However, I have to be clear, open and honest about the scale of the challenge facing the State. Over the past month, we have been contracting hotel accommodation. This week, we are going out to pledged accommodation. Right now, this is our primary source of accommodation. Over the coming weeks we will get a better sense of wider accommodation through local authorities, religious organisations and State bodies. Some of this may require renovation. This accommodation is unlikely to meet the level of need should some of the higher estimated numbers of people arriving come to pass.</p>
            <p eId="para_83"> If we are to offer people shelter and security, we have to have contingency options and these are being put in place. These include the use of arenas and conference centres such as Millstreet and CityWest, as well as the use of Gormanstown. It will not be own-door, and may mean camp beds in shared spaces. It is not our first preference. However, it is there as a contingency if at some point it becomes needed. We have a war on our borders and we are facing a humanitarian crisis on a scale we have never seen before.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">What the Minister has outlined is around accommodation, which is the first port of call and the first important thing. However, I have been hearing from local community groups such as family resource centres that have been to the forefront of assisting families fleeing conflict in Syria and Afghanistan. In Cavan-Monaghan a number of family resource centres have been reporting that staff are under extreme pressure on a daily basis with requests for help and support for these families who often have limited English. Workers in the centres are trying to cope with an expanding list of critical needs in terms of education, housing, social welfare, medical appointments and citizenship applications. The work goes on through lunch times, late into the evenings and often at weekends. That was before the conflict in Ukraine and the dreadful plight of the Ukrainian people. We can expect that this is only going to increase as Ukrainian people settle in different areas, and rightly so. It is going to exacerbate a bad situation that is already there. What plans does the Minister have to increase funding and resources to community groups and the family resource centres to deal with refugees?</p>

            <p eId="para_85">There is a great deal of goodwill among the public as is evidenced by the 20,000 offers of accommodation and also the significant donations and cash amounts that were shipped out in recent weeks. Community groups really want to be able to provide support, whether people are in congregated settings or spread right across the country. It is not going to be so easy to gather together those different ideas.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">What kind of platform is available to community groups that want to engage, whether they are offering welcome packs, communications services, transport or any of the various offers that might be made? Given that the people coming here will be spread right across the country, does the Minister have a plan for transport? How can we accommodate groups of people, whether a group of friends or those engaged with a particular organisation, in terms of transport options, in a situation where they may be scattered across the country?</p>

            <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_87">First, it is important to say that we are taking an all-of-government approach, led by the Department of the Taoiseach. The Deputy is right that transport will be a key element and I will be engaging with the Department of Transport on that. It is important that each Department is responsible for its particular element of the response to the crisis. We all will work together to deliver for the very significant needs of Ukrainian refugees.</p>
            <p eId="para_88"> I will engage with Tusla regarding family resource centres. Its CEO, Bernard Gloster, has indicated that it is looking to support the Government's work in terms of the response to Ukrainian refugees in individual communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> On the wider co-ordination point, which speaks to both of the Deputy's questions, the community forums are being stood up at the moment. He may recall the community call initiative during the Covid crisis. We are looking to a similar model now and the County and City Management Association, CCMA, is being asked to contact all the local authority chief executives and ask them to convene meetings of statutory community and voluntary agencies that can co-ordinate what is needed. The work that needs to be done in Cork and Cavan, for example, may be different from what is needed in west Dublin. The effort must be shaped to each particular area.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">I would welcome any supports that can be given to family resource centres because they really are under pressure at the moment. That is before they even start to deal with people from Ukraine.</p>
            <p eId="para_91"> The Minister said a cross-governmental approach is being taken. Is there a good plan in place in this regard? Many of the people coming here are highly qualified professionals in areas where there are staff shortages in this country. Will they be allowed to work within a short period of arriving here? It would give them the means to support themselves and feel they are contributing to our society and it also would fill shortages we have, especially in the healthcare sector, where there are shortages of nurses, doctors and therapists within the disability sector. Is there a plan to get people working as soon as possible?</p>

            <p eId="para_92">I welcome the Minister's update and the engagement with the community forums. There are two almost distinct timeframes at play here. There is the immediate need as people are arriving and there is the question of how they can be supported in the longer term. In terms of the immediate or short-term response, I have offers, for instance, from a company's sports and social club that wants to make welcome kits available to children arriving here. There is a school that wants to make its gym's shower facilities and so on available. All of these kinds of arrangements will have to be prepared in advance. If it is a matter of waiting for the councils and the city and county managers to assemble a forum, it will be a little too late for those offers to be ready for when people arrive. Is there a platform or opportunity for these types of early set-up offers to be taken on board? They are only for the short term but they would help with the more immediate needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_93">I, too, have concerns about the plans. I really welcome the work that is being done to welcome Ukrainian refugees but, like other Deputies, I have had several telephone calls from people who have houses available but need more communication and information on how to proceed. I contacted Carlow County Council, which told me it is setting up a forum and gave me a telephone number. I said that I have had loads of people contacting me and I need to know where to go for information. There is no branch of the Irish Red Cross in County Carlow, although there is one in Kilkenny and it does an excellent job.</p>
            <p eId="para_94"> It is correct that the timing of all this is crucial. It is great that the local authorities do a good job in such matters, as they did during the Covid crisis, but we, as Deputies, are to the forefront on this. We are getting a large number of telephone calls but we cannot give people information because we know nothing about what is happening. I have contacted all the different Departments trying to get that information. Many people in different communities are coming to me, as an elected representative, looking for help but I do not know where to send them. Communication will be key in all of this. It is just not about local authorities but it is also about all the different groups and everybody working together. This is an urgent issue and a crisis. If we all do not play our part, the outcome will not be good. I am not happy with what is happening in terms of engagement with communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_95">It is 28 days since Russia invaded Ukraine. All of Europe is responding to a crisis none of us foresaw and which is happening at a scale none of us foresaw. Yes, the response right now is imperfect. We are doing our best to meet the immediate needs about which Deputy Moynihan spoke and to plan for what could be very significant medium- to long-term needs. The entire system is coming together but it will take time before everything is perfect. I genuinely think Cork County Council is in a better position to decide, for example, that a school can make shower facilities available to a local group, rather than such decisions being made at Government level or by the Department of Education. That is really important.</p>
            <p eId="para_96"> I have asked the Department of the Taoiseach to make sure the community forums are being established and will be up and running. If they need help in getting contact numbers and so on, it is important to get that right. It is important that they know, and we all know, who to contact. There is a process, which is the same process that worked during the Covid crisis, and it is getting up and running. It is not perfect and it will be imperfect for a while, but we have a clear mechanism to deliver in the short term while we work on the plans for the longer term.</p>

            <p eId="para_99">As the Deputy is aware, accommodation is being made available by the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, of my Department to meet the needs of Ukrainian refugees. So far, accommodation has been provided to more than 4,500 people. The community sponsorship model he referenced was developed by the Government in collaboration with non-governmental partners such as the Irish Red Cross, the Irish Refugee Council, Nasc, Amnesty International and Doras Luimní. The purpose of the programme is to enable communities to welcome refugees to Ireland and to ensure communities are supported as they engage with refugees to find sanctuary here and integrate into Irish life.</p>
            <p eId="para_100"> During the arrival of Afghan refugees in 2021, a less formalised version of this programme was adapted to support groups wishing to welcome Afghan arrivals in an emergency situation where time did not allow for a full training programme to take place. Communities already are becoming engaged in the process of providing support to Ukrainian refugees, as we discussed in the debate on the previous question. Community forums are being established to serve as a mechanism for channelling community and voluntary support to Ukrainian refugees. The model is similar to the community call approach that was adopted during the Covid crisis. Local authorities will be able to provide details of the community forums in each country, which will oversee community initiatives to support refugees. Community support will be crucial in ensuring refugees are successfully integrated into Irish society.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> As the Deputy is aware, a key part of the community sponsorship scheme is the provision of accommodation to refugees. Members of the public already are providing such accommodation through the national pledge process managed by the Irish Red Cross. It is open to communities to submit pledges to the register, encompassing both accommodation and community supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">I welcome the work the Government has undertaken since this crisis began. As the Minister noted, it is only 28 days since the invasion took place and we are undertaking a multimillion euro and multifaceted approach to dealing with many of the concerns that have been raised. More could, perhaps, be done but we will get there in time. The events taking place internationally are deeply concerning, as I am sure he acknowledges. The community sponsorship scheme was used for the first time a number of years ago at the time of the Afghan crisis. It has been a successful way to encourage a degree of integration and assistance to refugees. We are now living in extraordinarily dangerous times. The world has changed utterly since 2016, when a general election took place, and we need to adapt to this new reality. Ireland's place can be as a beacon of peace and refuge for people who are in need across the world. We must ensure we resource that status and style of approach. I would welcome any further details the Minister can provide in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">The Deputy is right that the community sponsorship model was brought forward in a different time and it responded to the very real needs of Afghan refugees last year and Syrian refugees prior to that. It was an extremely successful programme and communities really have rallied around to support those who arrived. However, it was done on a small scale, whereas now we are undertaking developments at a massive scale across the country, as we expect tens of thousands of refugees to arrive in the weeks and months ahead. We need to learn from the successes of the community sponsorship scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">We have to be in a position to upscale that at a much greater level and to respond to the many needs of Ukrainians. One of the Deputies raised the issues of employment and the desire of Ukrainians to engage in employment. Under the temporary protection directive, they have a right to join the jobs market. We are considering expediting membership applications to the Teaching Council and other professional bodies to allow Ukrainians into the workforce as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_105">I have a couple of additional points based on observations I made on my community in the weeks since this crisis began. Throughout rural Ireland, we see families, including young mothers and children, arriving. We need to do more to find suitable accommodation. Many places in rural Ireland could easily be renovated and brought up to a standard whereby safe accommodation could be provided, but conservation architects cause many issues when it comes to renovating many derelict buildings in towns and villages, as many rural Deputies will confirm. We could set these buildings up as emergency accommodation for the initial months until we find time to provide suitable housing for people who will be remaining here for the foreseeable future while the conflict is taking place. The Minister might examine this issue, if possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">I thank the Deputy. We are proceeding on a phased basis. The initial phase involves hotel accommodation. Two thousand five hundred rooms have been procured in recent weeks. We are now moving on to the pledges and seeking in the first instance to activate the vacant houses or fully vacant units into which people can move quickly. Following on from that will be shared accommodation in people's homes. There will be an element of vetting where a child is going into a home. We are engaging with a view to considering larger buildings, perhaps institutional buildings, including those of the HSE and religious institutions. We have asked local authorities to identify large vacant buildings that may not be in their ownership but that are in their areas and that could be renovated, as the Deputy stated. However, if the numbers increase, we will need more. The Government and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are considering the various options. We do not have the answers right now but we are working on them. We are asking everyone to work with us and to be reassured that we are very much focused on delivering for potentially large numbers.</p>

            <p eId="para_110"> The response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV is cross-departmental and multi-agency, co-ordinated by the Department of Justice. Tusla provides supports for victims of domestic violence, primarily through funded NGO service providers. In 2021, Tusla allocated €28 million in core funding for DSGBV services plus €2 million in contingency funding to address challenges arising from Covid-19.

Tearmann also provides outreach services in both counties. Tusla's funding to Tearmann in 2021 was just over €214,000. Tusla has indicated that it has engaged with stakeholders in the Cavan–Monaghan area about taking forward provision of safe accommodation and explored options for emergency provision during the Covid-19 period. As the Deputy knows, Tusla published its review of accommodation recently. It assessed the distribution of safe emergency accommodation and examined the level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for services and unmet need.</p>
            <p eId="para_112"> An interdepartmental group, led by a senior official in the Department of Justice, has been established to examine the physical delivery of refuge accommodation, identify obstructions to delivery, address the perception of significant delays in provision and identify how they can be shortened. Priority areas have been identified where there is the greatest urgency in achieving safe accommodation for victims of DSGBV. There will be engagement with local authorities, Departments and State agencies to source refuge provision, including in Cavan and Monaghan.</p>

            <p eId="para_113">I thank the Minister. I ask that he get a report for me on Carlow. I have been involved with various networks. A group of us, including all the relevant agencies, has been working together for the past few weeks, particularly since the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, announced Carlow was to have a women's refuge. We have a great network in Carlow but nobody has corresponded with it. Nobody has heard anything since the report was launched. Nobody knows anything. I sit on the group. We have a meeting next Tuesday. We are expecting another report from the Minister for Justice in April. It is to be the second. I welcome the fact that she, like the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, is committed to this, but the problem is that there has been no communication whatsoever through all the various agencies. The group I am part of has about 20 representatives from all the various agencies. Not one has heard from any Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">It is great that the Deputy has got the group together. It shows the genuine commitment to the delivery of refuge services in Carlow. The Deputy raised this with me when I visited Carlow recently. She has clearly identified that the mechanisms for the delivery of refuges up to this point have been slow, cumbersome and ill-focused. That is one of the key issues that the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is working on addressing to ensure we have a clear and fast-acting mechanism. We now have the report that has identified the gaps and now we need a fast process to fill the gaps and allow the groups the Deputy has been bringing together to link in with local authorities, get the capital funding, identify the site and build a suitable, appropriate and, I hope, specifically designed centre to provide for the accommodation needs. That work is ongoing.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">Again, I thank the Minister for answering. The matter is important. I have met the Minister and the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, several times about a women's refuge for Carlow. Particularly in the nine counties that do not have a refuge, the urgency is recognised. Sadly, Covid created a crisis for something we knew was not working properly. In Carlow, we have a network set up. We have got all the various agencies together. When I raised this matter as a question on promised legislation, the Taoiseach requested that we put together a group involving all the agencies and be ready to go. I even wrote to the Minister for Justice about properties on sale in Carlow. I have done everything I can. I assure the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth that I have left no stone unturned. I acknowledge he is committed. I ask him and the Minister for Justice to communicate with the nine counties affected, particularly Carlow. We are ready to go on this; all we need is the go-ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">The Deputy does not in any way need me to back her up on this. I was in Carlow–Kilkenny on Monday and met the various groups, including Carlow Women's Aid and the Carlow and South Leinster Rape Crisis Centre. They are so much further ahead than Tusla in their work, in what they have identified, in what they can deliver and in the speed at which they can deliver. What the Deputy says is absolutely accurate. I see the same in Dún Laoghaire. The accommodation review identifies ten spaces. The joint policing committee has been working on this for two years and has identified a need for 20 spaces. It is at the point of simply trying to get the building. My point is that the group is further ahead than Tusla. It is a point of concern where the accommodation review is behind what is actually happening on the ground between the local authority and Garda, led by the joint policing committee and councillors. When the accommodation review report comes out, it is behind the work in this regard. That is of concern to me. I ask the Minister, who has responsibility for Tusla, to call in its representatives and make sure Tusla is keeping pace with the work on the ground. This is too urgent to be allowed to go slow.</p>

That is an issue on which the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and I have been working. It has been decided across Government that the Department of Justice is the appropriate location for both the setting of policy and the delivery of new refuge space. We will be seeking to facilitate the transfer of the responsibilities. We have been working very closely with the Minister for Justice on this issue since the formation of the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">Again, I am going back to the question arising from Professor Mahony's report and one of his 17 recommendations and conclusions. It relates to the payment of €3,000. I have had the privilege of hearing the Minister's reply previously. I am happy with that reply. The content is perfect. He set out the answer. However, he is doing so in a way that does not take cognisance of the 17 recommendations which said that doing nothing is not an option. That is also set out in the context of delays to date. I ask the Minister to be specific on the details of the €3,000 payment and when it will be extended to others.</p>

            <p eId="para_119">I thank the Deputy. In March, following publication of the independent review into illegal birth registrations, I asked Professor Conor O'Mahony, the special rapporteur on child protection, to consider the significant complexities and challenges which arise regarding the issue of illegal birth registrations and to provide a report proposing an appropriate course of action. On 14 March, I published the report which sets out the 17 numbered recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_120"> Recommendation 16 in the report from the special rapporteur on child protection was that provision should be made to cover legal costs associated with a declaration of parentage of persons affected by illegal birth registrations. In response, the Government approved a once-off payment of €3,000 for those individuals whose illegal birth registrations had been confirmed by Tusla from the files of St. Patrick's Guild. That once-off €3,000 payment is intended as a contribution towards costs such as creating or amending wills or seeking a declaration of parentage. While it could also be used for DNA testing, Tusla has covered the cost of DNA testing for individuals in cases where records were insufficient to confirm an illegal birth registration and will continue to provide the support. </p>
            <p eId="para_121"> Tusla already holds confirmation of illegal birth registrations from the files of St. Patrick's Guild that can form the basis for payment to the individuals affected without any need to bring forward evidence and meet a certain burden of proof. There may be potential to extend the payment to other confirmed cases after the Birth Information and Tracing Bill has been passed to access records and people with suspicions may, therefore, be able to access the evidence necessary to confirm illegal birth registrations and effect a change in the birth register.</p>
            <p eId="para_122"> In terms of the basis for the figure of €3,000, this was by the work of the interdepartmental group on illegal birth registrations and the special rapporteur's recommendations in terms of the purpose of the payment. My officials are currently working to establish a scheme with the intention of making payments as soon as possible in 2022.</p>

            <p eId="para_123">We know that the potential extent of illegal birth registrations is huge. We know from the independent reviewer in Northern Ireland that there could be up to 20,000 cases or more. If we do not examine, we cannot find. The three monkeys come to mind. I mean that not in a disparaging way, but it seems to be a case of see, hear and do no evil. If we do not look, we cannot find.</p>
            <p eId="para_124"> The report from Professor O'Mahony in September was not published until March. That came on foot of the independent reviewer's report from Northern Ireland which is dated 2019 and was published in 2021. She recommended that we look at suspicious files. We have not looked at them. The 17 recommendations from Professor O'Mahony did not advise a payment of €3,000. He referred to making money available, but did not confine payments to those linked to St. Patrick's Guild. Why has the Minister made a decision that the payment should be confined to cases linked to St. Patrick's Guild on the basis that there is no evidence? We can never get evidence if we do not look for it. Other reports advised not to burden Tusla because it does not have the resources, or advised that it should be given resources if it is asked to do this work.</p>

            <p eId="para_125">The Deputy is absolutely right in saying that if we do not look we cannot find. That is why I have prioritised the birth information and tracing legislation, which provides the mechanisms to allow us to find this information and get birth certificates, records and early life information which is the core way in which we can find out if someone has been subjected to an illegal birth registration. We have the provision of a specialised tracing team, which Professor O'Mahony recommended. We have set out in our response to the recommendations how that will be implemented by Tusla. Tusla requires some additional legislative support to undertake the kind of detailed tracing that will be needed to determine what has happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_126"> As the Deputy knows, we are dealing with illegal acts that were usually deeply covered and concealed. For whatever reason, that was not done in St. Patrick's Guild. Therefore, we are providing the legislative tools in the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, and the resourcing tools to Tusla in terms of the €3 million in additional allocation in this year's budget. We are providing the mechanisms so that we can look for information.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">I appreciate that the Minister is doing his best, but I ask him to forgive my frustration given the context. At every step of the way there has been a delay. The Minister has to acknowledge that. Professor O'Mahony's report is dated September and was not published until St. Patrick's week.</p>
            <p eId="para_128"> I understand a lady asked for her name not be mentioned, which is the reason I have not mentioned it. I have asked the Minister to confirm whether she asked for her name to be taken from the independent review that she carried out because there were changes or alterations. I do not wish to say something that was incorrect. That is why am not using her name. I am not using her name because she, apparently, has asked that it not be used. Can the Minister tell me whether that is true so that I can attribute the very good work she did to her? That work was delayed for almost two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_129"> When there is that type of background, it is hard to have confidence in the system. I am here and I have a voice. I am speaking for the people who are voiceless outside and do not have any trust. I find it increasingly difficult to keep my trust. I am on record as having praised the Minister and have said I do not doubt his bona fides, but history is becoming more and more fragmented even in these reports. I only have summaries of the reports before me.</p>

            <p eId="para_130">Professor O'Mahony conducted a very detailed piece of work within a short period of time. When I get detailed work, I give it the time to consider it. There were 17 detailed and complex recommendations. I do not rush into things in this area. I give them time and consideration. Through doing that we have a strong Birth Information and Tracing Bill and strong Institutional Burials Bill because they were given the time to assess the various elements that needed to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_131"> In the context of the independent reviewer's report, the independent reviewer was commissioned to do a piece of work. She did that piece of work. The Attorney General recommended a small number of redactions from the report. I have to accept the response of the Attorney General. Our Department indicated that to the legal reviewer. She indicated she was not happy with those and we indicated that was the legal advice we required. She asked for her name to be removed. We commissioned this piece of work from her, therefore we believed it was appropriate that we publish it and attribute it to her.</p>

            <p eId="para_134">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to set out a response to the question in the House. The autism innovation strategy is in development, with the current focus on design, consultation and collaborative working structures. National action in respect of autism is a firm commitment in the programme for Government 2021 and I announced an intention to develop an autism innovation strategy and launch it in 2022. In budget 2022, the Minister and I secured €100,000 for the design and implementation of the autism innovation strategy and for awareness raising around it.</p>
            <p eId="para_135"> The autism innovation strategy will be aligned to Ireland's existing policies like the NDIS and comprehensive employment strategy. The innovation strategy will complement these structures by focusing on the specific challenges that face people with autism. We will seek to break down barriers by focusing on practical and tangible actions and outcomes. When I talk about practical and tangible actions and outcomes, I talk about them in various veins, including education, housing, employment, care settings, independent living and support so that we can have a good vision of how to support persons with autism. </p>
            <p eId="para_136"> As part of the strategy development process, a stakeholder-led strategic oversight and advisory group, which I will chair, will be established through an open expression of interest. The group will contribute to the development of the full draft of the strategy and will also have an ongoing role in the process of monitoring the implementation of the strategy. The full draft of the autism innovation strategy will be put to public consultation before it is adopted or implemented by Government, which will give people the opportunity to have full and open engagement.</p>

I understand when the strategy is rolled out and devised it will at all junctures try to advance the rights of people with autism and address the challenges and barriers they face. Nonetheless, we all know the pressures and challenges faced by people with autism and their families, and they are significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">I hope that as the strategy evolves, and with input from all stakeholders, we can arrive at a point where significant policy recommendations can be made that will improve people's lives and their interaction with the State and its services.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">My hope and aspiration for the entire strategy is that persons with autism will have a voice in the context of how their day-to-day living is impacted. It is also important to ensure parents have a voice. I refer to the issues of accessing services, education and housing, as well transitioning from school into higher education, the workforce and everyday life. That is the whole piece. We must listen to the voices of persons with lived experience in respect of where there are barriers or where various Departments may not have not considered this in the round. There are three stages to the strategy. The first step will be a public consultation on its design. The second step will be the establishment of the strategy oversight and advisory group. It will comprise stakeholders and persons with lived experience, who have to be front and centre. The final piece of the strategy will be its going out to public consultation before it is adopted.</p>

            <p eId="para_143">The Deputy is never one to miss an opportunity. Let us be clear. The strategy oversight and advisory group will comprise stakeholders and people with lived experience of autism and neurodiversity. The group will input into the development of the strategy and have an ongoing role in monitoring its implementation. The group will be established following an open expression-of-interest process. As I outlined to the Deputy, the interdepartmental strategy development group will comprise officials and representatives of relevant Departments and agencies. Its purpose will be to develop actions, including the autism innovation strategy, following the initial second consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_144"> As regards the recent court case relating to the SOP, I welcome the clarification by the HSE this week that it will not be challenging the ruling.

I believe significant progress can be made through my Department's co-ordination of the EU child guarantee, which is an important initiative that aims to combat social exclusion by guaranteeing access for children who are in need of a range of key services. I will publish our national action plan for the child guarantee shortly. The commitments under the guarantee address critical matters such as: free access to early childhood education and care; education and healthcare for children in need; healthy nutrition, including a healthy meal each school day; and adequate housing. Tackling child poverty and effectively implementing the child guarantee will require the commitment and active and sustained participation of my colleagues across government to ensure it is collaborative, integrated and, ultimately, impactful.</p>
            <p eId="para_148"> As part of the EU child guarantee process and in developing the successor national policy framework to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, I will be engaging with my Cabinet colleagues to consider the most appropriate and effective structures to pursue the reforms necessary to improve outcomes for our most disadvantaged children and young people. The child guarantee will form part of the broader body of work supported by the new national policy framework for children and young people and its implementation structures. Addressing child poverty was identified as a priority action under Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures and it will remain a priority in the successor framework currently being developed by my Department.</p>

I refer to issues such as difficulty in education or homelessness which can have lifelong implications. There is also the pressures on families. I refer to the work we on the housing committee do on homelessness. Our recent work in supporting local authorities to produce more housing, including cost-rental and affordable housing, will have a significant impact in that regard. There is positive and good work being done on this. I am particularly interested in the guarantee for children in need of effective and free access to early childhood education and care. Access to that education is key to their well-being and life ahead. I ask the Minister to outline the work being done in that regard, particularly work being done on housing with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.</p>

            <p eId="para_151">The child guarantee will sit as a part of the broader successor framework to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures. It is the national policy of the State in respect of children. I have asked that child poverty be a key element of our new national policy. The EU child guarantee will sit within that. The guarantee is a little narrower in its scope; it is targeted at children who are most in need. The two documents will progress together. I was at a meeting of EU ministers for children some weeks ago at which we discussed the implementation of national action plans. We will be publishing our national action plan and sending it to the Commission shortly. I previously met the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on a range of issues relating to housing, housing for children and homelessness among young people, but I have been engaging with his Department in respect of using the planning system for the improved delivery of sites for school-aged childcare as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_153"> Obviously, the Minister is fully aware of the implications of Ukrainian residents coming to live in Ireland.

            <p eId="para_154">We are very aware of the impact this brutal war has had on so many civilians, but particularly on children, and we will in the coming weeks have to provide supports to those children as they arrive. As I stated earlier, right now the response has very much been towards getting accommodation. It is currently about getting shelter and safety for people and making sure they have a bed, but wider supports will have to be put in place. I spoke earlier about the work Tusla is doing with some of the most vulnerable children, those who have arrived here as unaccompanied minors, but continued work will have to be done in my Department to ensure the availability of early learning and care, while the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will have to work to ensure children have the ability to access the curriculums at those stages.</p>

            <p eId="para_158">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_159"> Significant investment is being made by my Department to support parents with the costs of early learning and childcare. The national childcare scheme, NCS, is currently supporting thousands of families to offset their costs. A recent review of the NCS showed that 38% of families had more than half their early learning and childcare costs covered by the NCS.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">Some 56% of families had more money to spend due to the scheme and 28% of families were working more because of the NCS, with 8% reporting that they would not be in work at all without it. I recognise that the burden on some families remains high and we will need to do more to ensure affordability and sustainability. I outlined earlier the package of measures we are bringing forward in core funding of €221 million in a full year to support early learning and care and school-age childcare services. This will have a primary impact on affordability because the payment of this additional money is linked to a commitment to a fee freeze by childcare providers which will immediately bring about some degree of certainty for parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_161"> In budget 2022 we have also extended the universal NCS subsidies for children of all ages up to 15. Previously the universal subsidy only applied up to the age of three and now it applies to the age of 15 which we estimate will benefit approximately 40,000 children in the course of a full year.</p>
            <p eId="para_162"> Since August 2020 early learning services been able to access the employment wage subsidy scheme, which has allowed many of them not to increase their fees. We have seen that the previous very high increases in childcare fees did not manifest in the years 2020 to 2021. It is important to recognise that more money needs to be invested in the national childcare scheme and all three parties in government are committed to doing so. I hope to be able to begin that process in budget 2023.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_163">I thank the Minister. I hear regularly from constituents who raise issues around affordability and availability of childcare and it is an issue that is becoming more pressing now. When we welcome so many young children to Ireland from Ukraine, we also have to provide for them. It is very important that we address the affordability issue here. Many more childcare workers tell me of how they want to have an opportunity to stay working and to progress in the sector as valued employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_164"> In Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, the report of the expert group on a new funding model for early learning care, school-age childcare issues such as core funding, tackling disadvantage, affordability measures, fee management and the role of the State were addressed. What steps will be taken to make childcare more affordable? </p>
            <p eId="para_165"> People are in contact with me regularly. A lady came to my office the other day who has had her second baby. She told me that she was thinking of giving up work as she cannot afford childcare which, she said, was more expensive than her mortgage. That is a worry.</p>

            <p eId="para_166">The Deputy has raised a wide range of questions there that I probably will not be able to address comprehensively in one minute. The core funding is there this year to ensure that childcare workers are supported, reflecting the point that the Deputy has made that they are not getting adequately paid. It is also to support the sustainability of services in order that the 4,500 facilities that are open remain open and that there is encouragement there for new services to open. It also begins advancing that affordability element by ensuring that these fees are not raised in the 2022-23 academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_167"> The Deputy is correct, however, because crèche fees are still too high, even when they have been capped for that one year. That is why my and the focus of the Government for budget 2023 is on the national childcare scheme. That is the direct subvention the parents have received. We have broadened that out this year by making it available up to the age of 15 but we need to put significantly more money into the NCS and all Government parties share a commitment to do that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_168">I know that the Minister is fully committed, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who was spokesperson for children previously. It is important that parents understand how committed we and the Minister are and communication to all of the different agencies is key and of great importance here. No mother should ever have to come into any Senator or Deputy’s office and say that she might have to give up work because she cannot afford childcare. We have excellent workers within the childcare sector who are very good in what they do and we are very lucky in that respect. Overall, it is important that we do our best to support these workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_169"> What role does the expert group continue to play? Will this be an advisory role and can the Minister tell me what its status is and what will be that group's next steps?</p>

            <p eId="para_170">The childcare sector, like every other sector, is looking at increasing costs right across the board. The cap that is in place for some of them is going to be inoperable because of the dramatic rise in costs. The Minister needs to look at that issue specifically.</p>
            <p eId="para_171"> He also needs to look at the broader issue of affordability. Even in a county like my own, a rural county constituency of Roscommon and east Galway, we have very significant problems on the availability now of childcare because many providers are pulling out. They just cannot make ends meet and cannot get staff because of the pay rates that are in the sector at present. </p>
            <p eId="para_172"> There is something fundamentally wrong with a sector where the people who are packing the baby wipes on to the shelves of the supermarkets are being paid more than the staff who are minding the children and using those very baby wipes in our childcare facilities across the country. That needs to be addressed urgently.</p>

            <p eId="para_173">I thank the Deputy for his contribution. That is the reason that I am bringing forward a package of €221 million in core funding for the childcare sector in a full year. That money is primarily designed to address the issue specifically raised by the Deputy on the rates of pay that our fantastic childcare professionals receive at the moment. Core funding, dependent on the employment regulation order that is being negotiated at the joint labour committee right now, will deliver increased rates of pay for those childcare workers, which means that they will not be leaving the sector and that the services that exist now will not have to shut rooms because they will be able to continue to get staff. That is linked to the fee freeze and because if we are giving this very substantial amount of money to the sector, the State has to get something back, which is why we have the fee freeze. As the Deputy has correctly identified that is not enough which is why the focus is going to be on increasing the NCS in next year’s budget. </p>
            <p eId="para_174"> To address Deputy Murnane O’Connor’s question on the expert group, this group has been stood down now and it is now within my Department’s remit.</p>

            <p eId="para_178">I thank the Deputy for his question. Last week, I visited the United States to undertake a series of engagements as part of the State’s annual St. Patrick’s Day programme, as well as to head the delegation attending the UN Commission on the Status of Women as Minister responsible for equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_179"> These engagements bolstered the Irish Government’s support for the large Irish-American communities in Philadelphia and New York, particularly after having been suspended during the pandemic. I was also afforded the opportunity to meet several US elected representatives, community leaders and business leaders, where I was keen to raise issues related to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. </p>
            <p eId="para_180"> I also represented the State at the 66th annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. Ireland’s commitment to the UN is strong and it was important that a member of the Government join government representatives from around the world to discuss critical issues related to women and their role in responding to the climate crisis, as well as to discuss domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, gender norms and to deliver the national statement on behalf of the Government. Again, it was also a very useful opportunity for me to raise issues related to Ukraine with other countries and international organisations. </p>
            <p eId="para_181"> In total, I participated in 38 engagements over seven days, and I am happy to list them further in the supplementary time. I would like to take this opportunity to praise the consul general, Helena Nolan, and the ambassador, Geraldine Byrne Nason, and each of their respective teams, for the extraordinary work they do in representing Ireland’s interests in the United States and the United Nations, which I got to experience at first hand.</p>
            <p eId="para_182"> I would also like to extend my deepest sympathies to them and to the family and friends of the ambassador, Jim Kelly, who very tragically passed away last week. Mr. Kelly served Ireland with distinction at the United Nations in recent years, and in his other postings throughout his career as a diplomat.</p>

            <p eId="para_183">As we are very short on time to go into this in detail, I believe that 38 meetings over a short period of time is quite an extensive number of engagements. The House in general would benefit from reports and updates back from all Ministers who go on these visits as we will all gain from the experience that he received overseas.</p>

            <p eId="para_184">I found the bilateral engagements with a number of ministers particularly beneficial. I met ministers from Belgium and from Sierra Leone where we discussed the support that Irish Aid is giving there. With Belgium we discussed issues to do with their approach to domestic violence. I met the British minister on women's issues and it was a very useful engagement there. In particular, I had an engagement with the vice president of Iran, where I took the opportunity to discuss issues to do with the response to the refugees in Ukraine, and to refugees generally such as in Afghanistan and Syria.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">I also took the opportunity to raise the importance of the protection of LGBT rights in Ireland. I asked the minister for women in Iran to reflect on the fact that Ireland has moved a long way in our approach to LGBT rights from 30 years ago to our approach now, and I suggested that, perhaps, such a journey should also be travelled in Iran.</p>

Jim was a massively important member of the Department of Foreign Affairs team. He was an ambassador and was central to our team in the UN Security Council since we joined that council. He passed away very unexpectedly last weekend. On behalf of the Government and of this House, I wish to recognise an extraordinary career of service to Irish foreign policy and the role he continued to play, as a father figure in many ways, for many of the younger people in the Department and particularly for the team in New York, where our team has performed in an extraordinary way in the face of so many challenges since we joined the UN Security Council.

            <p eId="para_190">I appreciate that flexibility, a Chathaoirligh.</p>
            <p eId="para_191"> On the important question asked by Deputy Brady, since the illegal, unprovoked and unjustified further invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces on 24 February, Ireland has stood in unwavering solidarity with the people and Government of Ukraine. Ireland’s response to the invasion has included engagement with EU partners and at the UN, development of sanctions against Russia; bilateral contact with the representatives of Ukraine and of Russia in Ireland and the provision of humanitarian aid for Ukraine. Ireland’s efforts at the UN, EU, the International Criminal Court, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and across all multilateral institutions are aimed at bringing this madness of war to an end, ensuring accountability for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law and meeting the humanitarian needs of the vast number of people caught in the conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_192"> My Department is carefully monitoring the progression of direct talks between Ukraine and Russia. Ireland stands ready to support initiatives which can deliver peace, in line with international law and which respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. The Government is providing €20 million in humanitarian aid as well as medical supplies. Those funds are already being disbursed through partners in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_193"> At EU level, member states agreed a €500 million package of direct military assistance for Ukraine. On Monday, EU foreign ministers signalled their political approval for an additional €500 million in military support, which was approved last night. Ireland’s total share of that overall fund will be €22 million and will go towards non-lethal elements in that package. EU sanctions were adopted on six occasions which, together, are the most extensive sanctions in EU history. The aim is to incentivise President Putin to find a political solution to the conflict he has created, and to reduce funding and equipment available to Russia to continue its military campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_194"> Finally, Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU membership. EU leaders acted swiftly in inviting the European Commission to submit its opinion on Ukraine's application to become a member and will strengthen the bonds and deepen the EU-Ukraine partnership.</p>

On 5 March, Russia categorised Ireland as being an unfriendly country, along with a number of other countries. What assessment has been carried out and what threat does that pose to Ireland and our security?</p>
            <p eId="para_198"> Also, does the Minister agree with the comments of the Lithuanian foreign minister when he categorised the actions being taken by Russia as war crimes? Lithuania has moved to expel a number of diplomats, along with Bulgaria, Latvia and Estonia where diplomats have been expelled. Is now the time to stop dragging our feet and follow the example of four other European countries and expel Russian diplomats from Ireland?</p>

            <p eId="para_199">I thank the Deputy for his questions and for his support of the approach the Government has taken so far. With regard to Ireland being categorised as an unfriendly country, all of the EU has been categorised as being unfriendly towards Russia. That is a term it has used previously, and then it takes action on the back of that. Any actions of the back of that statement a number of weeks ago have not happened yet, but we can expect it will act at some point in time. For example, last year when there was tension between the Czech Republic and Russia, the Czech Republic was named an unfriendly country and Russia took actions on the back of that. We do not know what will happen in that regard. To be honest, there are bigger issues with regard to what is happening in Ukraine right now than what an unfriendly country means for Ireland. We are very much part of the collective effort within the EU to respond in as comprehensive manner as possible to end this war and to ensure we maintain and increase the deterrent for the continuation of the war, which is what the focus of sanctions has been.</p>

            <p eId="para_201">I would be interested to hear what our response is to the four other European countries that have moved to expel the diplomats, so I will listen with interest in that regard. The other major fallout of this grotesque and illegal war is the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding. Last week, the Ukrainian ambassador appeared before the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and she cited the experience in Poland with an Irish company. She alleged Ryanair is ratcheting up prices to profiteer on the back of refugees fleeing from war and persecution. Has the Minister or the Department looked at the charge or allegation that was made by the Ukrainian ambassador? She also welcomed a suggestion from me that Ireland, the Department and the Minister should charter flights to help deal with the refugees who are piling up in their millions in Poland, Moldova, Romania and other countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_202">I travelled to Poland last week to meet my counterparts there and to meet refugees. I visited the largest Ukrainian refugee hub in Poland where there were approximately 7,000 people, predominantly women and children and quite a number of elderly people. The scale of human misery and the responsibility for the EU collectively to respond to it are enormous. As the Deputy knows, Ireland will play its part in this. There are many routes to get to Ireland. Geographically we are quite far away from Ukraine by European standards. Certainly there are flight options. Of course there are ferry options and people are using them. With regard to Ryanair I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about this. My understanding is that he was to speak to Ryanair this week on concerns about the prices being charged for certain flights. I can only assume this has happened.</p>

            <p eId="para_208">I thank the Deputy. He was an incredibly popular person in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_209"> Addressing the difficult situation of undocumented Irish emigrants in the United States and working to secure legal pathways for Irish people seeking to live and work in the US continues to be a key priority for the Government, as it has been for many years. The need to address the challenge of establishing migration pathways, especially for the undocumented Irish, is of critical importance and has been raised by senior members of the Government at every opportunity. The issue was raised during our high-level political engagements over the St. Patrick's Day period across the US, not least in the bilateral exchange between the Taoiseach and President Biden on 17 March. I suspect it was also raised by my colleague, the Minister for State, Deputy Brophy. Irish political representatives will continue to build and maintain close relations with key members of the US Congress and high-level political contacts across the spectrum in the US, as we seek opportunities to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relations with President Biden's Administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_210"> I am pleased to see that immigration issues, including possible pathways to citizenship for the undocumented, are a priority for President Biden, as demonstrated by his proposed US Citizenship Act of 2021. The Government is actively supporting the efforts being made by his Administration, as well as efforts being made by the US Congress on a bipartisan basis, in the pursuit of comprehensive immigration reform, which still remains a very divisive issue politically in the US as the Deputy knows. Our embassy in Washington meets regularly with members of the House of Representatives and the Senate across the political spectrum. We are actively engaged with the Administration and Congress on finding innovative solutions and migration pathways to address the challenges faced by the undocumented.</p>
            <p eId="para_211"> In addition to seeking more options for the undocumented, the Government has continued its active support of a new E3 visa scheme that would facilitate legal immigration pathways to potentially thousands of Irish each year. The bipartisan reintroduction of the E3 visa Bill in Washington last week, that had previously been voted down by a small number in the Senate in 2018 and 2020, was a welcome development.</p>

            <p eId="para_212">It is estimated that every parish in Ireland has an average 20 undocumented Irish citizens in the US. In reality there are far more from every parish along the western seaboard and in the west of Ireland. We have a unique opportunity with President Biden and his cabinet, which has more members from the west of Ireland than the Irish Cabinet. We need to use these connections. Many Irish citizens have made the United States their home. They have family, children and good jobs there. They are good citizens contributing to the United States. We need to have a clear legal pathway to regularise the status of our Irish citizens in the United States. The E3 visa is part of this overall mechanism. The progress made on this recently is very positive. I urge the Minister to redouble the efforts to ensure this particular measure passes through Congress and ensure it can get an expeditious passage.</p>

            <p eId="para_213">Everybody in the House wants the same outcome, which is to find a way of regularising the lives of Irish people living in the US in the shadows. For many years they have lived and worked there and paid taxes there. In many cases they have married and have families growing up in the US. Often they are unable to come home for family funerals or for normal interaction with family and friends because they would not be able to get back into the US. It is a trapped way of living that consecutive Governments have been trying to address for many years. I do not know how many times I have been to Washington on this issue but it is quite a number. We have real friends in Washington who are trying to help us on this. This is not straightforward. Even to get the E3 visa proposal across the line is far from straightforward. We will continue to work not only with our friends in Congress but our friends in Australia to try to ensure there is a fast way to get this done.</p>

            <p eId="para_214">The Minister is correct. It is not just about focusing on the executive branch of government in the United States. The House of Representatives and the Senate are very important in this. The previous Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, appointed the former Deputy John Deasy as a special envoy to the US Congress to work on the issue of the undocumented. He worked very closely with the Minister. He worked very closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin and our mission in Washington to prioritise the passage of the E3 visa Bill. Should we look at appointing a special envoy specifically for this role again? This person would engage on Capitol Hill with the Senate and the House of Representatives to help progress the legislation. It will require a very co-ordinated and strategic approach. Would it be better to have a politician on the ground liaising on it?</p>

It is a very progressive example of how to do this.</p>

            <p eId="para_217">Perhaps a special envoy would help. I would say that our embassy in Washington is all over this. It is constantly briefing key people. We have very strong advocates and supporters in the Friends of Ireland group and people outside of it. The Biden Administration is also supportive. We are not short of political support. There are impediments, some of which are outside of the control of people in Washington, with regard to the nature of the E3 visa and its links to Australia. We are working on it, that is all I can say, with regard to trying to build an understanding in Australia also. That is part of what we need to do.</p>

            <p eId="para_220">Amnesty International is a respected NGO and I value the role it and other civil society organisations play on these issues. The assertions in the report echo those we have seen in a number of recent similar reports. These reports undoubtedly raise difficult questions for the Israeli Administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_221"> Ireland’s position on these matters is, and will continue to be, based on international law, including international human rights law and Israel’s obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention as the occupying power in the occupied Palestinian territory, and on the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. </p>
            <p eId="para_222"> Ireland’s priority is not to focus on language for the sake of it but to try to find a way to change reality on the ground. Therefore, Ireland has been consistently forthright in expressing concern regarding the unequal treatment of Palestinians in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. Ireland will continue to raise regularly our concerns regarding discriminatory practices towards the Palestinian people directly with the Israeli authorities, including during visits to the region, as well as at EU and UN level. I have visited the region on five occasions and have raised these issues bilaterally with my Israeli counterparts during those visits. </p>
            <p eId="para_223"> Ireland has also been proactive in consistently highlighting these issues, including demolitions and settlement expansion, at the UN Security Council during our current term. Ireland has maintained a strong approach at monthly meetings on the situation in the Middle East, most recently at the council meeting on 22 March, and has raised particular issues of concern, including the designation of Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organisations and housing plans by Israel in East Jerusalem.</p>
            <p eId="para_224"> We will continue to study the recommendations and conclusions of the Amnesty International report and will use it to influence the approach that we take towards trying to protect and encourage a peace process that can deliver a two-state solution, which is ultimately our priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_225">It is not a matter of using language for the sake of using language. Words have meaning and meaning must lead to action. The reports that have been published are also echoed by a recent report from the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of Palestinians in the occupied territories, Michael Lynk. To use his language, "Israel has imposed on Palestine an apartheid reality in a post-apartheid world." He goes on to say that "this system of alien rule has been established with the intent to maintain the domination of one racial-national-ethnic group over another", which is apartheid. International law is not an <i>à la carte</i> menu to pick and choose from. We have to stand up for international law no matter where in the world. We must call out breaches of that law and hold the perpetrators to account. Language is everything. Will the Minister use the word "apartheid" to describe the actions of Israel?</p>

            <p eId="para_226">I have not used the word "apartheid" and I have explained why. We have had a detailed debate on this issue and this report in this House. The Deputy was part of that discussion. The position I outlined then is the same as I have outlined today. Our approach is about bringing about change on the ground, helping Palestinians and holding the Israeli Administration to account for the decisions it takes. We have to build international consensus around that. That is what I am focused on trying to do. The Deputy seems to want Ireland to move into a space where we will be effectively on our own and to use language no other country in the world is using. He seems to think that this will start a domino effect and will change things. If I thought that was the case, I would be looking at it seriously. However, I believe the way to do this is to try to build consensus within the EU and the UN and to try to build groupings of countries that can genuinely put pressure on to force change on issues such as the settlements, forced evictions and settler violence which are undermining and eroding the basis for a peace process. That is what we have been trying to do.</p>

            <p eId="para_227">The Minister has also said that to use the word "apartheid" to describe these actions would not be helpful. I am not sure who he believes it would not be helpful to because it certainly would be helpful to Palestinians who have been calling out this apartheid regime for decades. I am not sure how many more decades the Minister is prepared to sit and wait before taking on the illegal actions of Israel. This report and numerous others have called for action. The use of the word "apartheid" is one but there are others that need to be taken not just by the UN Security Council, but also by this State. These include boycotting goods illegally imported from the occupied territories, undertaking arms embargoes and a whole suite of others. However, the Minister is prepared to sit by and allow breaches of international law to go unchecked.</p>

            <p eId="para_228">Yet again, the Deputy has outlined a whole series of actions he says we should implement but that we cannot. We do not sell arms to Israel, so how can we stop? The Deputy is calling for an arms embargo. Ireland cannot impose an arms embargo on Israel but he calls for one anyway because it makes for a good sound bite. He wants to impose trade restrictions on Israel. Ireland cannot do that. A number of Attorney Generals have now confirmed that to me and I have confirmed that to the Deputy but he cannot accept that because it makes for a good sound bite and he wishes to say it anyway.</p>

            <p eId="para_233">I thank the Deputy for the question because it is useful to put this information on the record. There are a number of channels available to Deputies to flag issues that their constituents are having with passport applications. The main issue creating pressure at the moment is the sheer volume of applications. It is off the charts when compared with anything else we have experienced in recent years. There have been record numbers of applications for three months in a row now, that is to say, we have had the highest number of applications ever. There were 137,000 applications in January, over 150,000 in February and there will certainly be more than 100,000 in March. In no previous year did we receive more than 100,000 applications in a month. That is what is driving the pressure. For the most part, the service is actually working reasonably well. In most cases, people applying for straightforward adult passport renewals are getting their passports back within 48 hours. Obviously, it is different for more complicated cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_234"> We need to have a system that allows our Oireachtas Members to intervene when necessary. In response to the high volume of applications being submitted to the Passport Office, a temporary phone line was established in October of last year to respond to Members' queries on urgent passport cases. That was supposed to be in place temporarily until the end of the year but it is obviously still continuing. This phoneline responded to more than 2,700 queries in 2021 and has already handled more than 3,600 queries to date in 2022. In addition to this, the Passport Office responds to a high volume of written parliamentary questions from Deputies regarding specific applications. </p>
            <p eId="para_235"> In each case raised by a Deputy, the Passport Office reviews the application in question. However, applications can only be expedited in cases of genuine emergency such as a need for urgent medical treatment overseas or the death of a family member abroad. Such applications are expedited through the travel emergency service. In cases where the estimated issue date has passed and the application is fully complete, the passport service will prioritise the application to ensure that no further delay is experienced.</p>

            <p eId="para_236">My office is dealing with a great many passport-related queries every week and is finding it more and more frustrating. I acknowledge that the online system works well for straightforward renewals. It is with the type of application I deal with that there are issues. The urgent passport number will only tell us what we already know. If you apply for a passport in an emergency, the passport cannot be intercepted. When we get to the point at which we can get a passport, we are given a number and told it will be out within two days.</p>
            <p eId="para_237">The problem is that somebody may need an emergency passport and may need to collect it now. The difficulty we, as politicians, are having is that the phone lines to the Passport Office are constantly busy. I understand what the Minister has said about the number of applications. Can we fast-track this so that a politician can actually contact a certain number and get a response?</p>

            <p eId="para_241">We are always open to suggestions to improve the experience. There have been very high volumes this week. I understand that the wait time on phones has been longer than normal. We will respond to that by increasing resources accordingly. That line is up and running; it was never there before. People effectively had to look online to see the status of their passport application. We put in place a specific Oireachtas service that only Oireachtas offices can call into, but it is busy.</p>
            <p eId="para_242"> Many of the applications are stuck in the system because there is a problem with the paperwork. We need to solve this because the communications between the Passport Office and applicants needs to improve so that we get a more consistent approach to passport applications. Of the applications that have been in the system for more than a month, 37%, or 38,000, require the applicants to provide further information. Those are often the applications that come to a Deputy's office and so on. We need to ensure the integrity of the system. We cannot just fast-track applications because that is what people want. We need to ensure we guard against fraud and ensure that we have the paperwork intact.</p>

            <p eId="para_243">Passport express is very misleading because it takes two months. Why market it as an express service? When additional information is required, why does an applicant need to go back to day one? The express system takes two months. If further clarification is needed, the applicant must go back to day one and has another two months to wait. The time runs on. It is supposed to be an express system. If the express service is going to take two months, can the application be dealt with in the two months without starting the application all over again at day one. I understand about the massive number of passport applications going through. More resources may be needed to address these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_244">We now have more than 770 staff in the Passport Office compared with 450 last summer. Within the next six weeks or so that number should be up to 900. That effectively means a doubling of staff in the Passport Office over the past six or eight months.</p>
            <p eId="para_245"> I agree with the Deputy on the turnaround times. Passport express is a bit of a misnomer. It is not an express service. It is a much slower, paper-based service through the post. That is certainly an outdated marketing term now. We are looking to move away from the terminology of passport express and to replace it with something like passport in the post or whatever. Ultimately, we want to get to the point where everybody applies online. By the way, over 90% are already online. We need to get to 100%. It is a much cleaner, more transparent, safer and faster system.</p>
            <p eId="para_246"> Up until a few weeks ago it was taking 40 working days for first-time applications through passport online. It is now down to 35 and falling. The Deputy said that a mistake on an application can start the clock all over again. We have also corrected that issue. If someone's forms were not completed correctly and they need to send in new forms, they do not start an eight-week period at that point; they will get it turned around within three weeks of that correction. We are responding to the constructive criticism we are getting from Deputies.</p>

            <p eId="para_250">This is also a useful question to respond to on the record. Ireland’s policy of military neutrality has long been an important strand of our independent foreign policy. As practised by successive Governments, the policy means that Ireland does not participate in military alliances or mutual defence arrangements. While militarily neutral, Ireland has always been politically active, promoting peace and development through the UN, the EU, and our bilateral initiatives. This approach has also informed our active engagement in the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP. In this context, Ireland has been engaging in a number of recent discussions on CSDP, including on the EU’s Strategic Compass, an important strategy document on the future of CSDP. Throughout these discussions, I have been clear that Ireland’s approach remains guided by our policy of military neutrality and our long-standing contribution to crisis management and peacekeeping. This policy is well known and respected by our fellow member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_251"> As part of our commitment to enhancing the EU’s ability to promote international peace and security, Ireland also participates in the European peace facility, EPF, an off-budget instrument established last year, which can be used to fund CSDP actions. On 28 February 2022, in the wake of Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, the EU agreed an EPF package of €500 million in military assistance for Ukraine to help Ukrainians defend themselves. This consisted of a €450 million allocation for lethal equipment - weapons - as well as an additional €50 million in funding for non-lethal equipment. On 21 March, EU foreign ministers reached political agreement on a further €500 million package of EPF assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_252"> Ireland's support, in line with the programme for Government commitment, will only be spent on the non-lethal elements of both packages. Our total share will be valued at approximately €22 million, which includes the provision by Ireland of 10 tonnes of ready-to-eat meals and 200 units of body armour for the Ukrainian military.</p>

            <p eId="para_253">I thank the Minister for his response. In recent weeks we have heard mention of being politically active and militarily neutral. I am only aware of it having come up recently. Nobody has ever said we should not be politically active. Nobody has ever said we should not be putting our views across in any situation. The question is about military neutrality. That is always been the question and has always been the concern. Some of the Minister's recent statements about the EU developments have also been of concern. He said there is a good chance that we will be involved in the rapid reaction forces that are being discussed at the moment. He has mentioned that some people are uncomfortable with the triple lock because the UN Security Council mandates could be blocked by Russia or China. I wonder who those people are because I have not heard anybody talk about being uncomfortable with the triple lock. The triple lock is a very worthwhile process. That is the only security we have in terms of our neutrality at this stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_254">I stand over all those things. People have questioned the triple lock for years on the basis of not being comfortable with a country in the UN Security Council being able to veto a decision Ireland might want to make to send troops to some part of the world. On balance - I have advocated for this - I think the triple lock is a good thing. I can completely understand why people would question it in terms of Ireland's ability to decide where in the world our own soldiers may go.</p>

            <p eId="para_256">Many people have questioned the wisdom of it. I can give the Deputy details on it if he wants.</p>
            <p eId="para_257"> In the context of my comments on Ireland potentially participating in a rapid reaction force, that is simply a development of what already exists. Irish personnel have been training for years in what are called battle groups, the most recent one led by Germany, which ensures interoperability, common standards and the sharing of training facilities and equipment. This is so that if Ireland does decide to send peacekeepers to other parts of the world with other EU countries, we know we are interoperable and we can work with each other.</p>
            <p eId="para_258"> We are involved in a lot of EU missions in different parts of the world, from training missions in Mali to humanitarian missions in the Mediterranean, and many others. It is not a new concept, this idea that we would work in partnership with other EU countries to promote peace and to make peace interventions in different parts of the world.</p>

            <p eId="para_259">In regard to working with countries in other parts of the world, would that include the Naval Service being involved in the EU naval presence in the Indian Ocean? In terms of interoperability, it would be interesting to know whether that is envisaged as well. The Minister might expand in the context of how we ensure the EP, budget at EU level is for non-military use?</p>

            <p eId="para_260">There are no plans to send any Irish naval vessels abroad for now. We have challenges in the Naval Service at the moment in terms of recruitment and retention. We have work to do to get our personnel strength up to where it needs to be so we have the flexibility to be able to send a vessel from our naval fleet perhaps to another part of the world, should it be justified to do so, should it be consistent with a UN mandate and should it have the approval of this House and the Government. That is just like we did when we sent a ship to the Mediterranean which, at the time when we did it, did not require a triple lock because it was a humanitarian intervention, as it happens, but I think it was strongly supported by everybody in this House, given the work they were doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_261"> On the EPF, we were very involved in shaping that to ensure there were two separate funds, one that could be used for lethal weapons and the other that would not be. It was on the basis of having that distinction in the EPF that Ireland supported it. Ireland, Austria and Malta were the three countries which ensured that and we will, of course, make sure that the system for how that money is spent has integrity.</p>

            <p eId="para_265">The Deputy does not need to tell me there has been a war raging in Yemen for the past seven years. I have answered questions on that many times here and I have spoken on it at multiple fora.</p>
            <p eId="para_266"> Yemen is one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, driven by seven years of conflict, economic collapse and the breakdown of public institutions and services which has left millions of people in need of humanitarian assistance. There is very strong consensus across the EU in support of the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, to bring about a political resolution to the conflict in Yemen. As a member of the Security Council, Ireland has also engaged extensively in support of the UN's efforts. I have held discussions with the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, as well as with Major General Michael Beary, head of the United Nations Mission to support the Hudaydah agreement. I have engaged extensively with the countries of the region, including in direct talks with the Foreign Ministers of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, UAE, stressing the need to work urgently towards a resolution of the conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_267"> In addition to significant diplomatic efforts, Ireland has been a consistent and reliable donor to Yemen and has contributed more than €37 million in humanitarian funding since 2015, including a commitment of €5 million for 2022, which I pledged on behalf of Ireland at the pledging conference for Yemen on 16 March. Ireland also contributes towards the crisis in Yemen as an EU member state. Since 2015, the EU has contributed more than €1.2 billion, including €827 million in humanitarian aid and €407 million in development assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_268"> Ireland will continue to support all efforts to end this terrible conflict, which I agree is causing enormous humanitarian suffering, including through direct engagement with Saudi Arabia and other regional actors and in the context of our position on the UN Security Council and as a European Union member state.</p>

            <p eId="para_269">Presumably, if anybody in this House suggested that we should send a trade mission to Russia to develop our trade relationship, given what it is doing in Ukraine, they would get pretty short shrift from the Minister and from everybody else, rightly so. It would be similar if anybody suggested that it would be okay for any of our allies, so-called, to be selling weapons to Vladimir Putin in the current context. Yet, strangely, in the context of the Saudi war that has brought Yemen to the brink of catastrophe, Ireland sent a trade mission in November to develop trade relationships with Saudi Arabia, which is conducting this barbarous war in Yemen. Our allies, the US and the UK, are selling billions worth of weapons. The latest deal by the United States is a $500 million air-to-air missile arms sale and there are similar massive sales by the UK. Where is the condemnation? Where is the criticism? Where is the demand that these relations with the Saudi Arabian dictatorship conducting this brutal war in Yemen end immediately? Where are these demands?</p>

            <p eId="para_270">The war in Yemen is appalling. Over 370,000 Yemenis have lost their lives, including over 10,000 children. We see some of our allies selling arms, with the UK in 2021 authorising sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia of £1.4 billion, and the US in November with $650 million in authorised weapons sales to Saudi Arabia.</p>
            <p eId="para_271"> Saudi Arabia's involvement is central to this horrific and brutal war on the Yemeni people. Will the Minister condemn Saudi Arabia's actions in Yemen? Will he also clarify for the record when the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, visited Saudi Arabia to deepen ties with this appalling state? Did the Tánaiste raise the matter of the war in Yemen? If he did, can the Minister tell the House when and where he raised the horrific human rights abuses with the Saudi regime and correct the record?</p>

            <p eId="para_272">The idea that the war in Yemen is categorised as a war for which one country is solely responsible is completely inaccurate. This simplified notion that it is all Saudi Arabia's fault is just not true. Saudi Arabia has a role to play in terms of bringing about a ceasefire and Saudi Arabia has responsibilities in terms of ensuring that civilians are protected in war, as any warring party has under international law and the relevant conventions. However, it is not true to say, as is being suggested by the Opposition, that all of this is one country's fault and that if only we would isolate it and implement trade embargoes and arms embargoes, all of this would stop overnight. That is not my understanding of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_273"> I have met all of the parties involved in different settings. I have faith in Hans Grundberg, who is the UN special representative, and he certainly would not take that view either, I can assure the Deputies. From my understanding, Saudi Arabia is supportive of a ceasefire under certain conditions, but that has not been possible to be agreed with the Houthi leadership. I have spoken to Iran quite directly in terms of their relationship and their influence with the Houthi leadership to try to bring about peace.</p>
            <p eId="para_274"> We need a balanced view. I do not say that we should not hold Saudi Arabia to account for its actions and decisions. We should, but we should hold all parties to the conflict who have been involved in brutality and attacks, particularly in recent weeks, to account. This is about bringing about peace and a ceasefire so we can help civilians to deal with the enormous human suffering that the population of Yemen has had to deal with. Drawing direct comparisons with the war in Ukraine is not helpful. Every conflict is different, complex and needs solutions. That is why we have special representatives for the UN who work full time trying to find a basis for peace. We should support those processes.</p>

            <p eId="para_275">The Irish Anti-War Movement, in conjunction with Saudi Arabian dissidents who can never return to their country because if they did, they would be killed, is organising a demonstration this Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Garden of Remembrance. Those involved will march to the Saudi Arabian embassy. The march was organised long before the war in Ukraine but, in a gesture of solidarity, they are going to make it also a demonstration against that war. It would be nice to see reciprocation from Europe in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_276"> Let us be clear that there is a difference, which everybody can see. The Saudi Arabian dictatorship is the most vile dictatorship you can imagine. They chopped up Jamal Khashoggi with a sword. They executed 81 people for political crimes at the weekend. They are directly interfering in another country, Yemen. Iran may have relationships with the Houthi, but it is not directly involved. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are bombing Yemen with weapons supplied by the United States and the UK. The latter continue to arm this brutal dictatorship, yet we want favoured trade relations with this regime and say nothing about arm sales.</p>

            <p eId="para_277">I have yet to hear the Minister condemn the actions of Saudi Arabia. I call on all international players to pull out, lay off and stop their involvement in and support for the conflict in Yemen, including Iran. However, Saudi Arabia is directly involved in dropping bombs on innocent Yemeni people. I ask the Minister to condemn that.</p>
            <p eId="para_278"> I also ask him to clarify the following, about which there seems to be some confusion. When the Tánaiste was over wining and dining with the Saudi Arabian regime, it is alleged he raised the war with it. It is also alleged he raised the grotesque human rights abuses, but there is no record of what was said. There are no minutes which show him raising that matter. Will the Minister confirm or deny that the Tánaiste, whilst wining, dining and trying to deepen relationships with this brutal regime, raised the issues, as is claimed?

My understanding is issues have been raised in relation to the war in Yemen by the Tánaiste but it is my responsibility as the Minister for Foreign Affairs to raise these issues directly with the countries involved, which I have done repeatedly on behalf of the Irish Government and people, in terms of expressing concerns. I have spent time travelling and meeting in person with the UN special representative, to try to make sure we are consistent with the international effort the UN is making to bring about peace. Let us not reduce debates and conversations on huge issues like war in Yemen to party slagging matches around Ministers' travel, wining and dining and so on. It is nonsense.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Colm Brophy)<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_287">The global games development fund is a matching funding partnership between my Department and the GAA that supports community-orientated GAA activities abroad. Established in 2012, it has been remarkably successful in the development of Gaelic games internationally and benefits hundreds of Irish communities abroad. It has grown from 14 projects in 2013 to over 100 projects this year. Funding from the Government's emigrant support programme has grown in response to that demand from €45,000 in 2013 to €200,000 this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_288"> The value of the fund was amply demonstrated in the response to Covid, when our GAA partner clubs and networks, along with our Irish immigration centres, became the backbone for the delivery of assistance and support to emigrants, including the Government’s dedicated Covid response fund. It is worth noting the incredible role played by many members of the GAA in supporting the Covid response.</p>
            <p eId="para_289"> A major review of the operation and objectives of the programme was carried out over the past year, taking into account the experience gained during the pandemic. I was pleased to announce a renewed partnership agreement when I met the president of the GAA and his officials in Croke Park on 8 March. This refocuses our support for grassroots activity, particularly by small community clubs. It increases the focus on youth involvement, as well as sponsoring regional tournaments that are a showcase for the games at international level. We will continue to develop the programme to reflect the changing patterns.</p>
            <p eId="para_290"> Administratively, we agreed to reinforce the role of Croke Park’s central management and strengthen our financial control procedures in line with the growth of the programme. Projects are identified through an open call mechanism conducted by GAA headquarters. The applications are screened at regional level by the GAA and funding decisions are taken jointly by the GAA and my Department. As our communities abroad emerge from the shadow of Covid, the Government stands ready through a strengthened programme to help them rebuild the infrastructure and activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_291">I thank the Minister of State for his response. I know from speaking to many people of Mayo descent living abroad that they take pride in the GAA clubs in their respective domiciles and the ongoing links these clubs provide to Ireland. GAA is in the blood of many county people and our conversations never drift too far from Gaelic games. The €900,000 global games development fund is going a long way to delivering projects abroad. It is a useful fund. Is there potential to expand to initiatives beyond sport, such as Creative Ireland or similar schemes? Our people hold their heritage with pride and, ahead of the next St. Patrick's Day, it would be great to see an expansion of the work with our diaspora.</p>

            <p eId="para_292">We are always looking to expand and see what involvement we can have. What we are doing in the GAA provides a good template for that. Part of the programme we are looking at supporting across the diaspora is the re-energising and re-rolling out of things like the St. Patrick's Day activities and festivals. They were an integral part of the community network that was badly affected by two years in which those programmes could not be held. My Department is committed to looking at how we can develop a range of supports for them in a similar vein to what has been done with the GAA.</p>

            <p eId="para_293">This global games development fund has significantly grown, as the Minister of State mentioned, from 2013, when just over 14 clubs were funded. I understand the fund contributes to one-off events and to activities lasting much longer than that. These projects are invaluable in supporting and nurturing a sense of Irish community. Many have created important links between global Ireland and the local community. I commend the Minister of State on that work. Does he envisage that fund will increase over the coming years?</p>

            <p eId="para_294">The Deputy made an important point. One of the key things we tried to emphasise in the redesign of this fund, in conjunction with the GAA, was to move away from once-off sponsorship and to a programme of ongoing development, particularly in respect of trying to strengthen clubs at grassroots level and the skill level to benefit clubs. This refocusing is designed to give a much longer-term benefit to clubs on the ground, in contrast to some of the previous once-off sponsorship.</p>
            <p eId="para_295"> We will continue to review this programme. It has been incredibly successful and I was pleased we were able to increase the support provided for it. It is the type of programme that is at the heart of where we see this development and a role model for involvement by ourselves and the GAA in the diaspora context.</p>

            <p eId="para_300">I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 111 and 123 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_301"> Ireland implements UN sanctions, as adopted by the UN Security Council, and EU sanctions, as adopted as part of the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy. Ireland does not adopt unilateral sanctions; the sanctions in force in Ireland in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine are EU sanctions, agreed and adopted by all EU member states. Similar measures have also been adopted by the US, Canada, UK, Switzerland and other like-minded countries. This co-ordinated effort magnifies the impact of the sanctions, sending a message of unity beyond the economic impacts.</p>
            <p eId="para_302"> EU sanctions have been adopted on six occasions in response to the crisis in Ukraine: on 23, 25 and 28 February and on 1 to 2, 9 and 15 March. Together, these are the most extensive sanctions in the history of the EU. The aim is to incentivise President Putin to find a political solution to the conflict he has created and to reduce the funding and equipment Russia has available to continue its military campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_303"> The sanctions have been adopted under two sanctions regimes in existence since the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, as well as under the existing sanctions regime in respect of the situation in Belarus. A new sanctions regime has also been created, imposing restrictive measures on the non-government-controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts in Ukraine. The sanctions are made up of sectoral measures, which target specific economic sectors, industries or broad areas, such as the media, and individual measures, which apply to named people and entities.</p>
            <p eId="para_304"> The sectoral sanctions introduced to date target the Russian financial, energy, technology and defence and transport sectors. Similar sanctions have also been introduced on Belarus, in view of the support it is giving to the Russian regime. Trade between the EU and the breakaway regions in Donetsk and Luhansk has been restricted. Restrictions have been introduced on the broadcasting of certain Russia state-owned media platforms in the EU, to try to limit disinformation. The financial sanctions on Russia are particularly wide-ranging, targeting 70% of the Russian banking system, as well as key State-owned companies. Among other things, they ban transactions with the Central Bank of Russia, restrict Russian access to the EU’s capital and financial markets and exclude certain Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system.</p>
            <p eId="para_305"> The most recent measures were adopted on 15 March and expand financial, energy, and security and defence sectoral measures. In particular, the sanctions prohibit transactions with certain Russian state-owned companies, prevent the provision of credit-rating services to Russia and restrict the import of iron and steel products from Russia. Exports of a wide range of luxury goods from the EU to Russia are also now prohibited.</p>
            <p eId="para_306"> Extensive individual sanctions measures have also been introduced since 23 February. A total of 685 Russians and Belarusians have been added to the sanctions list, and are therefore now subject to asset freezes and travel bans. Those sanctioned include decision-makers such as President Putin, his defence minister, his foreign minister and the members of the Russian National Security Council, Russian parliamentarians who voted in favour of the invasion of Ukraine, oligarchs who financially or materially support the military operations or benefit from them, Russian and Belarusian military figures and propagandists responsible for spreading disinformation about the Russian invasion. Fourteen entities have also been added to the list and are subject to asset freezes. These include banks, insurance companies, a so-called “troll factory” responsible for spreading disinformation and companies in the aviation, shipbuilding, machine building and defence sectors. </p>
            <p eId="para_307"> These most recent measures mean that 862 people and 53 entities have been sanctioned for actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine since the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Detailed information on all the sanctions adopted since this conflict began are available on my Department's website, including summaries of each of the new legal Acts adopted.</p>
            <p eId="para_308"> At the Foreign Affairs Council last Monday, 21 March, there was broad agreement on the need to maintain economic and political pressure through the adoption of a further sanctions package in the short term. EU member states have a range of views as to what this further package should focus on. Ireland would favour restrictions on energy imports from Russia to the EU, specifically of coal, gas and oil, but we recognise that many EU countries will need time to undertake energy transition measures to reduce their dependency on Russian oil and gas. Another key priority for all member states is the rapid and effective implementation of the substantial packages of sanctions already agreed. Ireland has asked the Commission to prepare a rapid impact assessment of the sanctions adopted so far, so that we have evidence of what measures are working most effectively and where we may need to plug gaps in future.</p>

            <p eId="para_309">The Minister addressed my question in the last line there in respect of the impact of the sanctions. My question is really on the efficacy of the sanctions. How do we know what impact they are having? How long does the Minister think it will take for the report on those impacts to be returned? He referred to it being done at EU level. What is the ultimate purpose of the sanctions? I support them, but I would like more details on them. I listened to an interview carried on radio recently. It was on RTÉ and done by an American. He said some goods in the shops in Moscow are marginally dearer, but regarding the impacts of the sanctions on the ordinary citizen, it seems these sanctions are impacting on more westernised and western-minded Russians. Therefore, I wonder how long it will take for these sanctions to impact in a deep way. Are we talking about a matter of weeks or of months? When does the Minister expect to see a political return from the sanctions? My basic question is: when do they begin to squeeze?</p>

            <p eId="para_310">Billions in Russian roubles are reportedly sloshing around the IFSC. Those funds are reportedly being used to circumvent sanctions. We have reports from <i>thecurrency.news</i> about €13 billion of domiciled money in the IFSC and from <i>The Irish Times </i>showing that €34 billion is held by opaque Russian-linked shell companies registered in the IFSC, while Colm Keena has done work concerning a network of bank accounts moving billions of euro from Russia to the west through the IFSC.</p>
            <p eId="para_311"> The question put to the Government since the start of this conflict has concerned what research it is undertaking to ensure that such activities can no longer happen. What are we doing to close that method of circumventing international sanctions against Russia? </p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_312">There were many questions there and I will try to be as precise as I can in responding. Ireland and other EU member states have asked for, effectively, an impact assessment as we go in respect of these sanctions. This war, though, has only been going on for a month. The first three rounds of sanctions packages happened over five days. Normally, it takes months to put an impact assessment in place. Therefore, everything in this regard is happening in fast-forward, if you like.</p>
            <p eId="para_313">I understand the European Commission is constantly working on a rolling assessment of how these sanctions are working and biting, the impact of them and so on. The EU has also been asked to consider mitigation measures for member states in terms of the impact of sanctions here. Of course, agreeing sanctions packages to effectively disrupt trade between Russia and the EU has a big impact on the EU too. These sanctions damage our own economies but are more than justifiable given the extent of the aggression and scale of human misery linked to what is happening in Ukraine.</p>
            <p eId="para_314"> This is why I believe sanctions will continue to get stronger to act as a deterrent to the continuation of this war. I hope they will work in parallel with very proactive interventions to try to bring about the basis for a ceasefire. I will answer the question on the IFSC at the next opportunity but it is not primarily my responsibility.</p>

            <p eId="para_315">I thank the Minister and it clearly takes time. Everybody is interested in the background - the rationale rather than research - for particular sanctions rather than others. We must be guided by the fact that the last people we want to penalise are our own citizens and people in business here. We do not wish to affect consumers here who have felt an impact. What is the purpose or rationale for this? In other words, what is the endgame for sanctions? What are they designed to do? Is it, as the Minister implies, to bring Mr. Putin to the table? Is it to put such a squeeze on those who support him that they would be minded to tell him that he should bring an end to this? Is it that there would be such a negative economic impact on Russia over a period that its leadership would be minded to take a different course of action? What kind of timescale does the Minister envisage for the sanctions to have the desired outcome?</p>

            <p eId="para_316">The IFSC is acting as a colander, allowing Russian money to percolate and therefore to circumvent sanctions. It is up to each individual country to implement and impose those sanctions, so will the Minister address that point? It is something of real significance and if it is happening, it means the IFSC is helping the Russian war effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_317"> Another way Ireland and the European Union is supporting the Russian war effort is by spending €500 million every single day on Russian oil and gas. The US and Britain have decided to target Russian oil and gas but there is an inability in the European Union to make proper decisions about this. The Minister mentioned Ireland does not adopt sanctions unilaterally but one of the problems in this country is we are continuously outsourcing elements of our foreign policy to the European Union. The Minister indicates we are stronger working together in making decisions with Europe, but if Europe will not make the bloody decision, how is it in any way stronger? It is still €500 million on a daily basis going from the European Union to Russia for oil and gas. That is at the same time we are giving money to Ukraine. It does not make sense.</p>

            <p eId="para_318">When dealing with the question of money flowing through the IFSC, we are all committed to the idea that Russia's ability to fight a war should be hurt as much as possible in a financial sense. Will the Minister indicate the status of the list of companies still trading with Russia and which we who sit on the European Union affairs committee were told by the Ukrainian ambassador, H.E. Larysa Gerasko, was given to the Minister's Department? I get that it is far better that we act across Europe as opposed to unilaterally but at the same time, one of the requests was that we would cut off access of Russia and its proxies to seaports here as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_319">It was an excellent question posed by Deputy Lahart on the purpose and efficacy of sanctions. Of course, the purpose of these sanctions must be to stop the war in Ukraine and bring Russia to the quite natural and obvious end, which is the negotiating table. Therefore, it is crucial that on a daily basis we analyse the impact of the decisions made and further decisions that could be made. We operate in partnership with the EU and as a member of the UN Security Council but, crucially, we must be guided by an independent Irish foreign policy that is based on our historic military neutrality. That means we can play a positive and constructive role in securing what the peoples of Ukraine and all over Europe are demanding, quite correctly, which is an end to the criminal Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

We are also working as part of a collective effort within the EU and the broader international community to try to find a way of bringing this to an end. The Deputy is correct that there are advantages to Ireland's historical approach to military neutrality and non-alignment.</p>

            <p eId="para_326">It is primarily a matter for the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland, along with other Departments. From my perspective, we have made commitments to EU sanctions and we must ensure they are fully implemented, including if that involves the IFSC.</p>
            <p eId="para_327"> With respect to Deputy Lahart's question, because of the pace of the issue there is a need to respond quickly. Normally, before the EU would impose sanctions on a country or another part of the world, there would be much assessment before making a decision. The judgment was made in this case by EU leaders that we needed to move far more quickly. The truth is there is an element of the unknown in terms of the impact of these sanctions both on Russia and the EU but because of the brutality of what we are seeing, we needed to act quickly to put in place a significant deterrent and make a very clear statement to the Kremlin that the EU would act quickly and together. It has done so. There was a miscalculation that the EU would not have the capacity to do what we have done.</p>

            <p eId="para_333">The Minister referred to a crisis that is playing out in fast-forward or at least in real time on media, including social media. There is also a catastrophe playing out in slow motion arising from the Russian aggression in Ukraine. We know Ukraine alone provides the wheat supply for more than half of the world food programmes and there shall be major implications for people across the developing world as expected crop crises unfold on foot of the invasion. Have we any plans for our overseas development aid in this respect?</p>

            <p eId="para_334">Given their important role in the world’s food system, together providing 12% of the world’s traded calories, global food security has been damaged by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The most immediate impact has been the significant increase in the prices of wheat, sunflower oil and fertiliser, which is already affecting food prices in import-dependent poorer countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_335"> With fertiliser prices increasing, food production prices will also increase, reducing farm incomes, just as climate stress and pre-existing conflicts are also complicating food production. Many countries where the Irish Aid programme is active, including but not exclusively Ethiopia, Syria, Lebanon, and Kenya, are particularly exposed to increasing food prices. With the World Food Programme’s humanitarian response also vulnerable to increased cereals prices, and also increasing transport costs, the situation of many of those at risk has deteriorated. The World Food Programme has reduced its rations to many of those dependent on its food distribution, and in Yemen, for example, 16.2 million people are food-insecure.</p>
            <p eId="para_336"> In addition to the Irish Aid humanitarian response to Ukraine, already exceeding €20 million in response to immediate needs, my Department will ensure that the whole of the aid programme is engaged in responding to the wider challenges arising from the food security issues arising from the invasion of Ukraine.</p>
            <p eId="para_337">Irish Aid has a strong track record from which to build in response to this crisis, building from our global leadership on food systems, including at last year’s food systems summit and through our board membership of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, as well as mainstreaming food across our development programme and humanitarian responses. Ireland has pledged €800 million to nutrition work over the five years to 2026, including a three-year strategic partnership with the World Food Programme worth €75 million to provide food assistance to the world’s poorest people. In addition, Irish Aid will work with partner governments on the re-orientation of social protection programmes and to improve agricultural practices.</p>

            <p eId="para_338">The Minister of State rightly draws attention to the proud record Irish Aid has in regard to our overseas development aid programme. I know that we like to try to fund multiannual projects which is right and correct. However, exceptional measures will need to be taken for the forthcoming food shortages. We also need to look forward in respect of climate shocks, which are mentioned in the programme for Government. While we did not anticipate this level of military crisis, climate shocks are going to affect agriculture in developing countries even more than they will affect us here. We are going to have to take emergency measures to feed the world's poorest. Unfortunately, as with all of these things, the worst effects of this crisis are going to be played out among the populations least able to afford them. We really need to be planning ahead and seeing what we can do as an admittedly small country to help in this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_339">The Deputy is quite right in his analysis. We are working with the World Food Programme. As a small country, our best involvement is through large international organisations. Under our commitment with the World Food Programme we have put in €75 million from 2022 to 2024, increasing support to it. The Deputy is right to highlight that in a number of countries where the World Food Programme is the primary source of food supply there are going to be issues later in the year. We are conscious of that. We are working on that. We are also working to ensure that our own aid programmes, while maintaining focus on Ukraine, continue to function within those countries. There is no question that there is a supply side issue from Ukraine and Russia to the World Food Programme. Even if that can be met there will be international price implications for World Food Programme purchasing. This needs to be a collective response and we are working on addressing it now.</p>

            <p eId="para_340">That draws attention to the fact that we need to have a short-term and immediate response to this crisis in terms of getting food to the most vulnerable. However, we also need to have a long-term response to food sovereignty and food security in developing countries. There is a reference in the programme for Government to vulnerability to climate shocks. We know we are going to see it intensify and worsen. There is an important role for Ireland in long-term overseas development aid and helping countries develop their own food sovereignty and food independence, particularly countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Many of our partner countries are in sub-Saharan Africa. I hope we will see a scaling up of our initiatives from Irish Aid in that regard, particularly in supporting food systems and agriculture in developing countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_341">I agree with the Deputy's emphasis on the longer term approach, particularly in respect of climate financing and adaptation. We are absolutely certain that a set of programmes is needed that enable food production to take place in a more localised way and make it as independent of inputs like fertilisers as possible. Stability of food production in key areas is needed. That is part of Irish Aid's ongoing commitment programme which we are continuing to strengthen. The immediate impact of what has happened in Ukraine highlights that these are really key things that need to be addressed. The Irish Aid programme is addressing them as we speak in terms of our approach to tackling that food security system.</p>

            <p eId="para_348">I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 126, 145, 147 and 161 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_349"> I was not sure whether this question was purely about Ukraine or about the broader relationship with Russia. I will give the Deputy answers on both.</p>
            <p eId="para_350"> Ireland has kept channels for dialogue with Russia open, and my officials have had numerous engagements with Russian interlocutors on Ukraine. During such engagements, we have consistently made clear to Russia that we view its aggression against Ukraine since 2014 as unacceptable. In all our interactions, we have also been clear on the need to uphold international law, especially the UN charter. We have also called for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. We have been unwavering in our expression of solidarity to Ukraine, and insisted on its sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.</p>
            <p eId="para_351"> In May 2021, in a phone call with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov I raised the detention of opposition political leader Alexei Navalny, treatment of minorities within Russia, the situation in Ukraine and Russian actions in the Czech Republic as points of friction and departure. In a bilateral meeting with Minister Lavrov at the UN in September 2021, I reiterated Ireland’s long-standing position against Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea.</p>
            <p eId="para_352"> Since Russia's further invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, my officials have formally registered Ireland's opposition to Russia's actions with the Russian ambassador. My Department is carefully monitoring the progression of direct talks between Ukraine and Russia. Ireland stands ready to support any initiative which can deliver peace, in line with international humanitarian law as well as international human norms and standards, and which respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.</p>
            <p eId="para_353"> Ireland's positions are well known and we have been consistent in meetings with Russian interlocutors. This consistency extends to meetings between our ambassador to Russia and the Russian Government. I have no influence over the Russian ambassador's statements to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I know that matter has been raised by some. In short, we speak to the Russian Embassy all the time at senior official level. Sometimes those conversations involve me. I can assure the Deputy that we are direct and consistent in the messages we are sending.</p>

            <p eId="para_354">I fully appreciate that channels for dialogue are open and that they are constant and consistent. Have they led to anything? Is there any progress? The Minister briefly mentioned the ambassador's performance before the Oireachtas foreign affairs committee. I note equally his performance on RTÉ and his slew of absolutely offensive statements.</p>
            <p eId="para_355"> In more practical terms, the embassy is in my own constituency of Dublin Rathdown. There is understandable desire from so many people to protest against the continuing Russian presence in Ukraine. Practically, however, this is having an impact on the residents on Orwell Road and nearby. At what point does the need for expulsion here, as we have seen in other European member states, become not just an aspiration but a reality? Is keeping the channels open actually achieving anything when they continue to put out a slew of disinformation and maintain two defence attachés? Let us not forget that Russia continues to bomb women and children out of their houses in Ukraine on a daily basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_356">It is my judgment that having a diplomatic channel for communication and sending messages makes sense on lots of levels. Even if there is a war going on, people need to talk. If we are going to continue to try to bring an end to that war, talking is necessary and diplomatic interventions are necessary, even if we fundamentally disagree with the people we are talking to in terms of the approach they are taking and the legality of that internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_357"> Having said that, we are assessing whether the extent of the presence and the Russian diplomatic footprint in Ireland is appropriate. We continue to speak to a number of other EU countries that are doing the same. This week, a number of EU countries have made decisions in that regard. I suspect there will be decisions, next week perhaps, by other member states. When we are ready to make decisions from an Irish perspective, we will do so.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_359">In a report published yesterday, KBC Bank says it expects the average household to be €2,000 worse off this year as result of the cost of living crisis. This will hit lower- and middle-income earners hardest. Yesterday, representatives of the Central Bank told me in a committee meeting that they expect household bills already are €1,300 more than they were this time last year and that there will be an additional cost for food of about €600 for the average household this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> Workers and families cannot bear these costs without significant financial hardship. We know many families already are facing difficulties. According to the CEO of ALONE, an organisation that advocates for older people, the latter are choosing whether to use their money to keep the heating on or to buy food. That is the situation in which they find themselves. Young people, too, are confronted with similar choices. These are choices nobody should have to make. The war in Ukraine has turbocharged inflation and rising prices but we have been in the grips of high inflation since the second half of last year, with energy prices spiking while households already were facing unaffordable rents and housing costs. In its quarterly bulletin, published yesterday, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, said it expects inflation to average 6.7% this year. The Cental Bank expects it to peak at 9% by the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Rising prices do not affect everybody equally. They hit lower-income households the hardest. Workers and families need support, and they need it now, to weather the cost of living crisis. Without it, they face massive difficulties and many will be forced into poverty. We recognise that households cannot be fully insulated from the full effect of rising prices but the Government can, should and must do more to support them. Last week, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, ruled out any measures to provide additional supports to households until October. That is not credible and it is simply wrong. It is not the step he should be taking as Minister for Finance. These individuals need additional support. The Government and the Minister have a responsibility to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> As a result of rising prices this year, those in receipt of social welfare payments are now significantly worse off than they were last year. The Minister should not stand over this. It involves some of the most vulnerable in our society seeing the sharpest cuts in their living standards and in their ability to provide basic necessities for themselves and their families. That is the reality they face. For months, we in Sinn Féin have been calling on the Government to respond to this reality and to increase core social welfare rates in response to rising prices. It has ruled out doing so time and again. Just last week, the Minister ruled it out at least until the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> We know some households are more at risk of poverty than others. More than a third of households in the State use home heating oil as the primary fuel source to heat their homes. In Border counties such as mine, two thirds of households rely on it. Last week, the cost of filling a tank reached more than €1,600. Many households simply cannot afford this increase without cutting back on other essentials. That is what is happening in the real world. We in Sinn Féin have called on the Government to remove excise duty on home heating oil, which would take almost €100 off the cost of a tank fill, to ease the burden on those households. The Government has ruled that out and voted against it.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> I am asking the Minister for Finance to act to protect those who are most vulnerable. Will he protect workers and families from the sharpest edge of these inflationary increases? I ask him to change his position and to contemplate other supports for the workers and families who are hardest hit. Will he look at a social welfare package to support those who are most vulnerable? Will he remove excise from home heating oil?</p>

          <p eId="para_365">The Government absolutely is aware of the anxiety and additional costs that many people across our country are facing at the moment due to the rise in energy prices, which is mostly being caused by what is happening in the war in Ukraine. We are aware of the worry that many now are contending with as they see their bills go up due to the rising price of food, which is due, in turn, to the food consequences and the raw material consequences of what is happening in that awful war.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> It is precisely in recognition of the additional costs that so many are facing that the Government already has acted. Since we brought in last year's budget, we have acted on two separate occasions. We brought in measures that are now in the process of being implemented to make a difference. We brought in the additional payment of €125 for those who are most at risk of energy poverty. We have brought in, and shortly will see implemented, the €200 rebate on electricity bills. Only a number of weeks ago, we brought in additional measures on the price of fuel at the pump, as well as other measures to try to help with the cost of living, which we know is building.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Deputy Doherty made reference to the ESRI report and the inflation forecasts that are included in it. That same report made the point that as we move into dealing with this latest crisis, we are doing so with an economy that is growing, with 2.5 million people at work and with flexibility and capacity for the Government to respond to the latest challenge to which our country, our people and our economy must rise. One of the reasons we are in a position to do so is that while we were dealing with the challenges of the past number of years, we did our best each day to do all we could as a Government and to act in a sensible way, while being conscious that this challenge is one that could be with us, and, indeed, was with us, for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> It is the same now. We face a crisis the duration of which is uncertain due to forces that - in fairness, Deputy Doherty acknowledged this - are outside the control of our country. The Government needs the ability and capacity to respond to all of the additional costs and needs to which we will need to respond, and we are doing so. A total of €800 million in funding for additional measures has been given since budget day, as well as the €1 billion in funding for measures announced on budget day, to help with the rising cost of living. We will help with that. The Deputy is raising this issue at the same time as his party in Northern Ireland has just voted through a rates increase for local councils. Decisions his party has made in Northern Ireland, include, for example, an increase of 3.9% in the rates bill families and ratepayers will pay in Mid Ulster. I assume the reason his colleagues in Northern Ireland are doing this is that they are facing the same pressures and challenges we are facing here and are trying to find ways in which they can raise money to respond to the challenges their constituents and communities have and to the challenges they know are approaching.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> That is the decision the Deputy's party is making in Northern Ireland and it is the very kind of decision the Government is trying to avoid at this time. Instead, we are bringing forward measures that we know, for many people, will not insulate and cover them from all the costs they are now facing but which will help them. We are determined to ensure those measures are implemented swiftly.</p>

          <p eId="para_372">The Minister talks about understanding the anxiety that is out there. I can tell him that for the people I represent and to whom I speak, their anxiety levels went through the roof when they saw him on their television screens saying, "Let me be clear: I am not planning any additional measure to support you, your household or your family until at least the budget." This was on the same day that Bord Gáis Energy increased the cost of gas by up to 40% and electricity by nearly 30%. Other suppliers will follow suit.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> The Minister talks about what he has done. I ask him not to listen to me but to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which has said it is not enough. Social Justice Ireland has said it is not enough. Organisations that advocate for older people, including ALONE, have said it is not enough and that he needs to do more. People who are depending on social welfare are poorer now and are wondering how they will get the extra hundreds of euro needed to heat their homes or put food on the table for them and their families. They are looking to the Government, which has a responsibility to act in the national interest and to protect those who are most vulnerable from this spike in inflation. The Minister is refusing to act. He has the power and ability to do so now. Instead of increasing the cost of home heating oil, which he plans to do on 1 May, let him reduce it.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">Inflation makes everyone poorer, particularly those on fixed incomes. In Ireland, energy costs have a far greater impact on inflation than in anywhere else in the EU. I want to put three practical suggestions to the Minister. Our electricity prices are among the most expensive in Europe, with Irish families paying, on average, €180 extra for electricity annually. This is partly as a result of Irish families being forced to subsidise the cost of green electricity, grid connections and backup supplies for existing and already-planned speculative data centres with no substantial employment dividend here in Ireland. The Government decided in 2018 to stop the practice whereby those struggling to pay electricity bills were subsidising the speculative developers and instead make data centres pay their own electricity costs. Therefore, the Government must reduce the cost by stopping the data centre subsidy.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> Tomorrow the European Council will discuss the possibility of block-purchasing natural gas, which has the potential to reduce our electricity costs. However, we have no way of storing the gas, even though we have two potential facilities off the Cork coast — the decommissioned Kinsale and Seven Heads gas fields. When I was Minister, I asked my Department to assess the potential of these wells for carbon capture and storage and their potential for the storage of natural gas. In December 2020, in advance of the Dáil deciding on the decommissioning of the Kinsale wells, I sought a copy of this assessment. Sadly, this vital information was not made available to the Dáil, but we were promised that the assessment would be completed by the end of last year. I have now been informed that it will be early 2023 before this assessment will be published, nearly six years after the process commenced. This is far too late for Ireland to capitalise on any natural gas price discount from the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Carbon tax is supposed to be an environmental tax to drive behavioural change but the current carbon tax model is flawed in this regard because the goal is about bringing in more taxes rather than driving change. If we are serious about moving away from our dependence on fossil fuels, we need a model of carbon taxation that is actually fluid. We must do so by taking into account the ever-changing cost of a barrel of oil. If carbon taxes increase significantly and the price of oil collapses, they will not bring about the type of step change we actually require. When the price of oil increases sharply, it has a direct impact on the cost of living for families as well as a devastating impact on our small, open economy. We are seeing this impact today. It will get even worse when carbon taxes are increased in five weeks' time because Ireland is more exposed to price volatility than most other EU countries.</p>

          <p eId="para_396">I thank Deputy Naughten for raising those very important matters. I will answer each question he has put to me in turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> The Government will of course participate in any collective procedures or arrangements that are possible within the EU to examine how we can establish more clearly the certainty of supply and manage the affordability challenge that I know so many in the House are concerned about. As Members know, the Taoiseach is travelling to the European Council meeting. One of the key issues will be how we can accelerate our progress towards energy independence, with targets set for both 2023 and 2030. It will be a matter of determining whether there are new policies that the European Commission and EU can put in place that would allow us to respond collectively to the issues the Deputy is raising. I am sure the Government will view any such proposals from the Commission favourably.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> I take issue with the Deputy’s reference to speculative data centres. As he knows, many of the data centres located in Ireland, if not all of them, are associated with companies that are very large employers. The presence of a data centre in Ireland should not be seen in isolation; it should be seen in the context of companies that are employing hundreds, if not thousands, of people all over our country. Particularly with the changing world we are in and the kinds of changes that will happen with regard to corporate tax, an environment in which data centres can be associated with the ability to employ large numbers is a real asset for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> On the Deputy’s point on the sharing of the report, I am afraid I am not aware of the status of the report and why it may not have been made available at the point the Deputy indicated. However, I will certainly follow up with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on it. As the Deputy knows, the Minister and his Department are working on a new strategy on energy security and independence, the need for which has been emphasised by the dramatic and deadly developments of recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> On the Deputy’s point on carbon tax, I am well aware of the model he has proposed. In fairness to him, he has raised this on many occasions, in the Dáil and elsewhere. The one difficulty with the model he makes a case for is that it gives no clarity at all to the Government regarding what our future revenue from carbon taxation could be. As the Deputy knows, carbon tax plays a role in helping us to fund all the changes that he and the Government want to see happen regarding retrofitting and how we can make progress towards energy independence.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">The point I am making on data centres is that families that are struggling to pay electricity bills should not be subsidising the cost of electricity going into the centres. It is immoral and needs to be stopped.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> May I make a final suggestion to Deputy Donohoe in his role as Minister for Finance and chairman of ECOFIN. We need to see, across the EU, a review of the commodity-trading rules for both oil and gas. While oil production has been maintained in recent times, we have seen price fluctuations in the commodity markets and, as a result, incentives for people to delay deliveries, which have led to the situation in Dublin Port whereby we had only a one-day stock of diesel. There are people lining their pockets and sitting at keyboards while families here in Ireland are trying to decide whether to pay for fuel and food. We need to regulate this.</p>

          <p eId="para_403">As we know, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has already said we need to consider the impact of very high energy use and the price the Deputy’s constituents and other citizens pay for energy. However, I would still make the point to the Deputy that the very data centres he is referring to are an invaluable element and will be even more valuable regarding how Ireland can continue to be a place in which very large employers are present.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> On the factors that influence the price of energy and the impact of speculative trading in that regard, the Deputy makes a fair and important point. The Commission is considering the ways in which we can better manage the price of energy and give greater certainty regarding the pressures that might arise in the coming period.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Some of the markets to which the Deputy referred play a valuable role in helping smaller businesses hedge against a rise in the price of fuel in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">It is very clear that this Government is determined to erode any remaining semblance of Ireland's military neutrality. It is doing so extremely cynically by attempting to portray it as a necessary and mature response to Putin's horrendous invasion of Ukraine. The truth is that it is not a new position for the political establishment or Fine Gael. We can go back 19 years to 2003, when Fine Gael proposed in a policy document to move beyond neutrality. The document supported participation in a common EU defence policy and abandoning the so-called triple lock, which requires that the Government needs UN authorisation and the approval of the Dáil before engaging in military action. That argument described the triple lock mechanism as a political straitjacket. Those words are very revealing about the attitude of the political establishment to neutrality in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> Ordinary people have overwhelming support for neutrality and see it as independence from military alliances and consistent opposition to all imperialism, be it Russian, American, British or whoever. It is a position in line with the slogan of "Neither King Nor Kaiser" raised by James Connolly in the First World War in opposition to the slaughter of working class people in a war for colonies and profit. In contrast, the political establishment sees it as a straitjacket and a restriction on its ability to cosy up further to US imperialism, including sending working class young people to fight and die in new wars for oil and profit. They have worked consistently and assiduously to undermine it, like with the criminal use of Shannon Airport to ferry over 2.5 million US troops to occupy the Middle East.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> The Government wants to be fully rid of it and now it sees its chance. Just look at what has been said in the past two weeks. The Taoiseach said that neutrality is a policy issue that can change at any time. The Tánaiste said we need to think about greater involvement in European defence. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said three days ago that there is a good chance we will be involved in the rapid reaction force and raised the need for a debate about the triple lock. All of this is being done without a public debate and the ability of the people to decide.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> Next week, we are using our Private Member's time to try to ensure that they do have a say and that we have a referendum to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution. That means no involvement in military alliances like NATO or the Collective Security Treaty Organization, CSTO. It means no transport of war material or personnel through the country to participate in armed conflict and it means no participation in European militarisation. I know the Minister does not agree with that, but he said a couple of weeks ago that it is appropriate to debate Irish neutrality. Would he agree to have the debate in public and let the people decide?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_211" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_410">There are few politicians in this House that better understand the practical value of our neutrality and the impact it has had on Ireland being able to support the vulnerable and stand by our principles and our commitment to human rights than, for example, the Taoiseach. As a Minister for Foreign Affairs, and now as a representative of the European Council, he has articulated the value of our neutrality on many occasions. The Minister for Foreign Affairs used an emphasis on neutrality and our commitment to human rights to, for example, see Ireland attain a position on the UN Security Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> I can assure Deputy Murphy of two things. The first is that this Government and those involved in this debate are well aware of the importance of our neutrality and the impact it can have on articulating and effecting Irish values on foreign policy in a world that has become so volatile and dangerous. The second thing I can assure the Deputy of is that there is no political establishment over here. Instead, what we have is a Government that is looking at a world that is changing and has become more dangerous. It is looking at millions of people who are fleeing chaos, trauma and the disintegration of their lives due to a war that is being waged by Vladimir Putin. We are seeking to find the ways in which we can co-operate most effectively with like-minded countries within the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> The very capacities and policies that we are now using to respond to this humanitarian crisis are the same that Deputy Murphy campaigned against, and has been against, for so long. From a humanitarian and defence point of view, the Government is responding in a way that is consistent with our policies and values. The Government has acknowledged that in a world that is changing and has become so much more dangerous we are neutral, but we are not neutral to the carnage and terror that is being inflicted on people in Ukraine at the moment. We are not neutral when it comes to that. They are values that we hold dear.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> When we see the scenes that are taking place and the poor children and teenagers coming to our airports without their parents, that is something that we are not neutral about and we want to respond to that. Any debate that takes place regarding the principles that underpin our foreign and security policy for decades to come will of course happen in public and in a way in which the Oireachtas is central.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">Will the Minister agree that there be a referendum and that the people get to decide on the question of neutrality instead of having a false mature public debate which does not actually allow the people to participate? Will the Minister accept that if Ireland is going to join a rapid reaction force which is, in effect, a super-sized European battle group comprising 5,000 soldiers, there should be a referendum? Would he accept that if Ireland is to drop the triple lock that there should be a referendum?</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> People in this country know there is a political establishment. If they look at the record they will understand that it is not yesterday, the day before or a month or two ago that the Government started trying to undermine neutrality. Fianna Fáil promised that there would be a referendum on joining Partnership for Peace, but then in government did not provide a referendum and instead just did it. Fine Gael MEPs voted to increase European military spending from 0.3% to 2% across the EU. Look at what has gone on in Shannon Airport. People do not trust the Government. The only commitment they want from the Government is that we have a referendum.</p>

Any policy that the Government is involved in implementing involving our Defence Forces or any other aspect of our public services will of course be consistent with our Constitution, the principles in our Constitution and the policies of this and previous Governments. In any debate that takes place in the future regarding our neutrality, if such a debate is to begin of course the people will be consulted. I again put it to Deputy Murphy that the very policies we are implementing to make a difference to those who are in the greatest need at the moment and the very aspects of the European Union co-operation that we are using are policies the Deputy has been against for his entire career. The Deputy cannot have it both ways.</p>

          <p eId="para_419">Last October, before the war in Ukraine, I asked the Government to reduce the intake from tax on fuel prices to 2020 levels. I understand the Government needs taxes to run the country, but it is taking in 51% of the price of petrol, and 44% in the case of diesel, in taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">My job and that of the Government is to protect the people of Ireland. The fastest way to do that is for the Government to reduce the tax that is locking the price on fuel. If that is done, people will be paying the increase in the cost of fuel but they will not be paying tax on the increase. That would benefit farmers, haulage contractors and those in every other sector. The Minister mentioned that there are 2.5 million people working in this country. I am talking about tax. The Government is taxing every single person not only on fuel but also on food because the cost of producing the latter is escalating as a result of the tax on fuel. It is the tax I am talking about.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> We know that there is an increase in demand for materials that are not there. The price of wheat has risen by 67%. The people of Ireland are being asked to grow wheat, barley and everything else when they are being taxed at source. The only answer is for the Government to take its 51% tax at 2020 prices. That will automatically go into every household in the context of home heating oil, fuel to run a car and reducing transport costs. It hits everyone across the board and reduces costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Silage contractors have told me that other countries are giving them 20% off the price of agricultural diesel. This means that they can try to go to the farmers to bring in the crops in order that we can have reasonably priced food. It is €1.40 a litre for green diesel for doing crops. From 47 cent a litre last year, it has gone up to €1.40. Suddenly the price of milk is going up. The costs for every household are going to go up.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> I want the Government to take its 51% tax on fuel at 2020 prices. Every household and person, whether employed or not employed, will be positively impacted by a reduction in the tax on fuel. That is all I am asking the Minister to do in one sector. It will help every family and person in the country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_424">The Deputy made reference to a number of really important sectors within our economy and society. He made reference to where we stand with regard to the haulage sector and the pressures farmers are facing. The Government has responded in respect of each of those sectors in recent weeks. We bought forward an excise reduction because it is a tax reduction and change that helps the business sector. It is unlike the proposal the Deputy is making in respect of VAT because it helps the business sector. We did that because if we look at the challenges that those in the haulage sector are facing, we know the rising cost of fuel is affecting viability and the ability of many of hauliers to move goods around the country. Not only did the Government act in that way, we also brought forward measures to make additional payments available to haulage companies, depending on how many trucks they have, to help them further with the challenges we are facing.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> On farmers and the challenges they are facing, again, the Government knows that farmers are fundamental not just to the economy but also in the context of the price of food. That is why the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, secured agreement at Cabinet on Tuesday to bringing forward a set of measures to help tillage farmers to respond to the challenges that exist. Again, while we cannot do all the Deputy and many of he rest of us want us to do, what we are doing is trying to help each part of the economy in a way that we are confident that we can afford to do for as long as we need to. We are doing so in order to respond to the cost-of-living challenges people are facing and to respond to new challenges we may have to deal with as the year goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> The measures the Government has put in place across the year, between our budget day measures and what we have just done, are worth approximately €1.9 billion. They are measures that address the cost of fuel, which we know is going up but it is going up by less than it would if the Government had not acted. We are bringing forward measures to help with the cost of energy and the cost of living and for those who are at risk of energy poverty. These are measures that, in their scale and in how quickly we have tried to implement them, compare very favourably with measures that are being implemented elsewhere at the moment as other governments respond to the challenges they are facing.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> We will do our best to help and to respond in respect of the issues that businesses, families and commuters are facing. Equally, however, we want to be honest and clear that while we can help, we cannot cover these costs in their entirety. The Government has, week by week, brought forward measures to help.</p>

          <p eId="para_428">I am talking about benefiting every household in the country. If the Minister does what I have asked him in the context of 2020 costs, there will be a reduction. He stated that the cost of fuel has gone up but the Government still takes 51% of the total cost. That is for every household. No matter what way one looks at it, it is 51% tax. If the Government takes its 51% tax on 2020 prices, that will go to the 2.5 million people who are working in this country. It costs them €50 to €60 more to fuel their cars and €1,300 a year more to put on the lights in their houses. The Government is after bringing in a retrofitting system that is outdated because the cost of materials has gone through the roof. The grant system the Government is putting in is not even justified because the grant has been neutralised as a result of the cost of materials going up. This is one thing the Government can do and it will have a positive effect in every household. It will help with the cost of their groceries and getting people to school or work. It is €40 to €50 a week. Once the Government does that one thing on fuel, it will improve the quality of life for everyone - the elderly, the young, the vulnerable and everyone else.</p>

          <p eId="para_457">Last month, in excess of 1,400 patients over the age of 75 waited for more than 24 hours in emergency departments before getting a hospital bed. That was up from 1,100 in January. This is an appalling way to treat elderly citizens of this State. In 2015, when a 100-year-old woman was left on a trolley for 24 hours, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil both said it was unacceptable. In 2018, the Minister's party leader, the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, said that people being left on hospital trolleys was indefensible. It is indefensible. It is indefensible that on this Government's watch, elderly patients in their hundreds suffer this indignity. It is especially galling when the three head honchos in the area of health are being paid the big bucks but we do not see the big results. Where is the urgency from the Government? The emergency departmental task force has not met since November. Does the Government have a plan to deal with this matter? What are the timeframes? Is it just going to allow, as it has in recent years, this indignity to elderly citizens to continue?</p>

We recognise how challenging this is for those who need care, but that is why the Government has done a number of things. First, it is why since 2018 the amount of funding we have put into the healthcare service has increased from €15 billion to more than €20 billion. That has allowed to happen three different things that we believe will be of help as we respond to the new challenges hospitals are facing.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">Last month, it was announced that the Dursey Island cable car service will be paused from 1 April for essential repairs. That was a considerable shock to the island's residents, to locals who farm on the island and to the local tourism sector, as the cable car is a significant attraction on the Beara Peninsula. The issue is the absence of a replacement service with the closure of the cable car next Friday. We need a publicly funded alternative service but no one is taking responsibility. The Minister for Rural and Community Development informed me that Cork County Council is responsible for any replacement. On Monday, however, Cork county councillors were informed that it is the Department’s responsibility. The only option for residents and landowners is to use private boats on a dangerous stretch of water. Some people obviously do not have private boats. There was a clear need for this to be financed and for a Minister to intervene. I would appreciate any comments from the Minister on this issue.</p>

I will contact the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is involved with this issue to see if any further help can be given. I know that his Department is aware of this and is trying to help. Equally, however, I know that some of the proposals that had been brought forward by it and the actions so far have not had the effect the Deputy wants.

          <p eId="para_473">As the Minister is aware, we believe that he should use the powers he has under the Consumer Protection Act to control the price of fuel, energy and so on. He has turned his face against that. However, there is one measure I would ask him to consider. Given that he has rightly given €100 per week to hauliers as an emergency payment to compensate for the rising cost of fuel because they depend on it to sustain their businesses, will he do the same for taxi drivers? Some 22,000 taxi drivers who were hammered during the period of Covid are again facing a massive hit in terms of the cost of fuel in order to sustain their businesses. Will the Minister consider extending the €100 a week emergency payment to taxi drivers?</p>

          <p eId="para_474">I genuinely acknowledge the interest of Deputy Boyd Barrett in raising matters on the taxi sector for so long, particularly during the pandemic, and I know that they have had a very hard time. I cannot give the Deputy the commitment he is looking for. The reason we brought in the particular measure referred to was because of the impact that would have resulted from the haulage sector not being able to move goods around the country. The Minister for Transport will look at whether other measures are possible to help that sector in any way, but I am afraid I cannot give the Deputy the commitment that he is seeking.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> While I am on my feet, on the matter raised by Deputy Cairns, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, has been in contact with Cork County Council and has made clear that her Department is available to help in any way.

          <p eId="para_476">This is Ireland’s first Neurodiversity Celebration Week. Its purpose is to celebrate and raise awareness of the different ways those who are neurodiverse experience and interact with the world around them. Neurodiverse conditions include autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, dyslexia and dyspraxia, to name just a few. With the growing waiting list to access supports, we are clearly not doing enough to support those who are neurodiverse. In Roscommon and Galway there are more than 500 children waiting for physiotherapy appointments. In January, more than 1,000 children across the two counties were awaiting initial speech and language therapy assessments and nearly 500 waiting occupational therapy assessments. This is simply not good enough. We have to do better. Parents are being left with no option but to seek services privately, if they are lucky enough to have the have the resources to do so or to be able to source them. What about families who cannot access such interventions? They are at the mercy of ever-growing waiting lists.</p>

The issue the Deputy has raised on waiting lists is the reason the Government has made a significant commitment to try to increase the number of people working within our health services at the moment, especially in the areas of therapy. More than €5 billion in additional funding has been made available to the Department of Health in recent years. I know the Department is working hard to recruit the therapists who, as the Deputy knows, are badly needed and who could make a very big difference to those who access their services and need their care.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">Following last night’s “RTÉ Investigates” programme, I again raise issues of transparency, as I have done on numerous previous occasions in the period from 2017 until now, regarding the funding announced in the context of the rural regeneration and development fund and other funds administered by the Department Rural and Community Development. In late 2019, three projects worth €6.8 million in total were announced for County Mayo while the whole of County Cork received €2.6 million. All of that money went in total to north-west Cork, while west Cork got nothing despite the fact that it had a shovel-ready project in the pipeline in the same year. Can the Minister assure me that funding under the rural regeneration and development fund was approved on the basis of the merits of the projects that were put forward and that no political influence was involved? What investigations will be carried out by the Government in respect of the funding irregularities exposed by the “RTÉ Investigates” programme last night?</p>

Much of the material that was used in the “RTÉ Investigates” programme last night is made available through the Local Government Audit Service. Some of the issues covered last night were based on findings that have come out from the audits of local government. To answer the Deputy’s question on how transparency in general is being delivered, this happens through the very audits which revealed some of the cases that were covered last night. I assure the Deputy that decisions on the funding of projects through the rural regeneration and development fund are, of course, made on the basis of the merits of the projects.</p>

That figure is up 29% in the past seven days. There are 55 patients ICU, up from 44 a week ago. Yesterday, 22,000 positive polymerase chain reaction, PCR, and antigen tests were registered. Anne O’Connor, chief operations officer with the HSE, has stated that 5,200 staff are absent due to Covid and that the number of teams available in hospitals is falling and that elective surgeries are being cancelled.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> We need to look at the whole question of wearing masks again on travel on public transport, in retail shops, etc. We also need to consider a return to mandatory mask-wearing.

We were always informed by the input we received from public health experts. As Deputies know, the Government still reserved its right to make decisions based on a variety of factors. We have not received advice to change the guidance relating to the wearing of masks in the settings referred to by the Deputy, but were we to get that advice we would act on it. We will continue to be guided by the advice that comes from the public health experts on the wearing of masks.</p>

          <p eId="para_485">This morning, unfortunately, I was not selected to speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, about the Passport Office. I have to raise it today because I have received several telephone calls about the telephone lines not being answered, the live chat and the emergency number and whether it is 24 hours. I am dealing with a case and I feel very sorry for the man concerned. On Tuesday, his wife and daughter flew out for a holiday, but he could not fly out because of his daughter's passport. The Passport Office needed further information. My understanding is that it is being processed at Balbriggan at present. However, because the office requested further information, the application has gone right back down in the system. We cannot have a system that is failing, and that system is a failure. I welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said this morning, as he always says, that the office has extra staff. I do not blame the staff. They are put to the pin of their collar. It is the system. It reminds me of a planning application. If somebody applies for planning and leaves something out, the application goes back down to the end again. In this case, all the details of the flight have been sent in. The office knows the child is flying out on a date, but all of a sudden the case is back to the end of the system. It is not acceptable.</p>

However, this runs counter to the clear statement in the Nationality and Borders Bill in Westminster. Amendments that would provide for an electronic system for travel authorisation, ESTA, style agreement for non-Irish citizens seeking to cross the Border were rejected by the House of Commons. This is something that impacts on every facet of life, not just in the Border region but across the country. What efforts are being made by the Government to continue to impress on the British Government its absolute commitments? The fact is that if we are going back to the days of being promised technological solutions, the British Government needs to go back and read the Good Friday Agreement properly.</p>

I am one of the 9,000, having been diagnosed 15 years ago. I and our health spokesperson, Deputy Cullinane, met MS Ireland recently and it has a vision to maximise physiotherapy treatment through a national physiotherapy service across all nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs. Its research shows that delaying and reducing disability due to MS could reduce costs to the health system annually by €19 million. This would be for a relatively low investment. MS Ireland has written to the Minister for Health and would welcome the opportunity to engage in a national level planning discussion with his Department. Does the Minister for Finance believe that the €880,000 this would cost would be value for money? Will he ask his colleague, the Minister for Health, if he will engage with MS Ireland?</p>

It is almost 15 months at this stage. Patients with diabetes and patients with cancer are all denied access to basic dental treatment. The Irish Dental Association met with the HSE on 2 March to try to get a resolution to this. The HSE has not rescheduled a meeting until June, which is a full three months away. Given that so many people across the State are being denied access to dental treatment and that schoolchildren are not being screened in first class and sixth class, where is the sense of urgency and what pressure has the Government put on the HSE to deal with this, in view of the length of time it has been going on and the fact that people are being denied access to dental care?</p>

His appointment last year was warmly welcomed by the mid-west and western region. Mr. Ó Céidigh rolled up his sleeves and in a post-pandemic world we have seen transatlantic services restored and the restoration of the vital hub at Heathrow. Ryanair services have multiplied. Indeed, there are 108 services this summer from Shannon. He has done a wonderful job. It is going to be hard to replace somebody of the calibre of Pádraig Ó Céidigh as chairperson. Prior to a new recruitment campaign starting, I ask that an analysis be undertaken to establish the reasons he has stood down as chairperson. That analysis must be looked at, considered and acted on before a new recruitment process is started.</p>

Of course, for any group to lose a person of the calibre of Mr. Ó Céidigh is a regret. It is a pity he is not going to be in a position to continue with that work on behalf of the Shannon Group. I understand that the reason he made the decision was the amount of time he needed to put into the role and it not being consistent with all the other commitments he has currently. Yes, of course we will look at what is the proper specification of this role.

There are no active transport options.

I am sure some of the Deputy's colleagues are probably lambasting the Minister, Deputy Ryan, for not delivering the so-called "pet projects" more quickly. We will certainly follow up on where we are with the A5. The Government is well aware of the importance of that road.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">With respect to third country nationals coming into Ireland, and God knows we have a lot of people coming in at present through no fault of their own and not as their first choice, there seems to be a problem with respect to people registering here as pharmacists. We passed the Pharmacy Act 2007 which put in place a third country route of registration. There seems to be an ongoing problem with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland which is charged with implementing this. It has been going on for quite a number of years. Will the Minister make inquiries with respect to this to see whether it can be rectified? It is a serious matter. We certainly need pharmacists here. They want to work in the industry and in pharmacy shops and retail outlets. Will the Minister come back to me on how he gets on?</p>

          <p eId="para_505">I need hardly tell the Deputy there is no silver lining in this awful cloud and the dark skies we are all confronting together. The Deputy's point and question is a reminder of the skills and expertise that will be coming to our country with people leaving their homes for reasons we all know are appalling and have to be condemned at every moment. I am also well aware of the need that we have for trained pharmacists and how important they are for our health services, particularly outside of our cities. I cannot give the Deputy a specific answer on the issue he has raised but I will follow up on it with the Minister for Health and I will ensure the Deputy gets an answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">I read today in the media that Revolut will launch deposit accounts for Irish customers. There is a lot of change in the banking sector at present. In light of this and the impending departure of Ulster Bank and KBC from the Irish market, I would be obliged if the Minister would give us a status update on the review being undertaken into the retail banking sector, particularly as we head into potentially more uncertain economic times with potential implications for interest rates.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The review is reasonably well advanced. In a few months' time we will organise a public stakeholder event to which we will invite all who have views regarding the development of our banking sector, whether it be the digital providers to which the Deputy has referred or, for example, Sparkassen and the community banking needs that have been debated for so long. We will invite them all to a public event and seminar to hear their views and integrate them into the work we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> The Deputy is right that huge change is under way in our banking sector in Ireland. It is also worth making the point that despite the changes to which the Deputy has correctly referred, our financial services sector and our banking sector have certainly emerged from the previous economic crisis of Covid having performed well. They avoided an escalation of non-performing loans and an escalation of those in mortgage distress. The Deputy is correct that huge change is under way. I will let interested Deputies know about the event. It would be great to give them the opportunity to participate.</p>

She lived eight years in direct provision. She is from Pakistan and has just completed her degree in early childhood education. She has a deportation order hanging over her head. As somebody who believes in a world <i>sans frontières</i> for people who are desperate, I am delighted with what we are doing for the Ukrainian people. However, it is hypocrisy to be deporting a family where we have educated them and where they have been living under our system, albeit in direct provision. We have a talented woman who is willing and wants to work in our education service being pushed out of the country. Will the Minister look to have the deportation order for Mehwish Saqib revoked?</p>

          <p eId="para_511">I thank Deputies Durkan and Smith for raising these issues. I know Deputy Smith is raising this matter for all the right reasons but equally she knows I cannot give an update on the status of any individual deportation issue or anybody whose status is being considered in our country at present. I am sure the Department of Justice is aware of the issue she is raising given the protest to which she referenced. I will also make sure the Minister for Justice is aware the Deputy has raised this issue with me and we will see if we can provide a direct answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> To respond to Deputy Durkan, the challenge of inflation we are facing at present is something more than what Ireland can respond to on its own. We need to look at how collectively in the European Union we can address the root causes of this issue. This is why a summit is taking place at present looking at the issues of energy independence and the affordability of energy. These issues are most effectively dealt with at a European level. I hope some ideas and proposals will emerge from it that will allow us to make progress on the issue to which the Deputy has referred.</p>

        <heading>Responsibility of Social Media Platforms (Defamation Amendment) Bill 2022: First Stage<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T13:50:00+00:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#MartinKenny" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Deputy Martin Kenny<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_513">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_514">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the law relating to defamation, in order to allow judgements of defamation be made against the social media platform on which the defamatory utterances were made when the social media platform in question is unable to produce the identity of the person who made the utterances, and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I will share the five minutes with Deputies Munster and Tully. This legislation, the Responsibility of Social Media Platforms (Defamation Amendment) Bill 2022, sets out to amend the Defamation Act 1961 to allow judgments of defamation to be made against social media platforms on which defamatory utterances are made when the social media platform in question is unable to produce the identity of the person who made the utterances and to provide for related matters. </p>
          <p eId="para_516"> As we know, there are anonymous people online who sometimes attack, defame and intimidate people. This Bill proposes a change to civil law to allow the person who is the victim of such defamation to take a case against the person who has primary responsibility, that is, the person who uses his or her keyboard or phone to type the defamatory material. While it might seem peculiar, I have some sympathy for the social media platforms when they say they are not publishers because they do not have the same editorial oversight as the publisher of a normal publication such as a newspaper. That does not exist with social media because it is instant. When somebody puts something up, it is online instantly. There is a difficulty there. The best we have been able to do up to now has been to ask people to take such material down. With this legislation, we are trying to ensure that social media platforms will not be too lax to know who is behind an account. They will have to be able to identify such people clearly and to provide that information to a person who has been defamed. If a social media company is unable or unwilling to provide such information, it will then be held liable for the defamation. This will put an onus on such companies to keep to an absolute minimum the number of accounts of this nature, accounts that people can hide behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> All of us, across the political divide, are aware that freedom of speech is important. We have to be able to say what we believe and put our point of view across. This is not about stopping that. It is about ensuring that those who step past that line are held to account. We unfortunately see people stepping past that line every day. There is, of course, a great deal of suspicion, and perhaps more than suspicion, that social media companies want to see things pushed to the edge and as much controversy as possible. This is a means of ensuring that they will be accountable for allowing such controversy if they do not ensure that they know the identities of the persons making such comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> I hope that the Minister of State and the Government will support this legislation and bring it through the House as quickly as possible. It is the right thing to do for ourselves and for everyone else in society. Many people across the country have been the victims of such attacks in the past and it is important that we get this legislation through.</p>

          <p eId="para_519">This Bill is designed to ensure that social media companies take responsibility for defamatory statements made on their platforms in cases where the companies in question are unable or unwilling to provide the identities of those posting defamatory statements. At the moment, social media allow those who make such statements to hide behind anonymous profiles. In some cases, they are unable or unwilling to identify the poster concern. Social media is operating like the wild west at the moment and this leaves people open to abuse, defamation and other harmful consequences with nobody held liable for the damage caused.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">Our hope is that this Bill may encourage social media platforms to take steps to change how they do business regarding defamation in an effort to avoid being sued. If they do not, they will need to face consequences as the burden shifts from the anonymous poster to the social media company and they will become liable.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">I was anxious to co-sign this Bill because I have witnessed within my constituency the devastating consequences of online bullying. Social media is a relatively new phenomenon and is a very useful tool for communication and sharing information about events. However, it has been misused by some who are basically cowards. They assume an identity and post their bullying or defamatory remarks about someone without using their own name. A young man Eden Heaslip committed suicide just before Christmas. He was bullied at school. Bullying has always existed in schools and in the workplace but now it is relentless because people can be targeted in their homes. They get no break from it whatsoever. I have no doubt that it was a significant contributory factor to his death.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> Social media platforms need to ensure that no one can make a comment without being identified. They need to introduce comprehensive measures to ensure that verification details are requested and that no one can establish a false online account.</p>

          <p eId="para_527">I will briefly outline the contents of the legislation. It is a short Bill which is very technical in nature. It has ten sections and one Schedule, containing the text of the 2020 new arrangements to borrow, NAB, decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> Section 1 sets out the definitions used in the Bill. Section 2 provides for the approval of the terms of the NAB decision and Ireland's adherence to, and participation in, the NAB decision. This also empowers the Minister for Finance to consent to future amendments to the NAB decision on behalf of the State, subject to a Government decision and consultation with the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> Section 2 grants the necessary powers to the Central Bank to perform the obligations and exercise the rights arising from Ireland's adherence to the NAB decision and clarifies that any moneys received by the State under the terms of the NAB decision should be directed to the Central Bank. Section 3 of the Bill provides that, in cases where amendments to the NAB decisions are approved by Dáil Éireann, a notice of this approval is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> Section 4 of the Bill provides for a ministerial guarantee to cover the Central Bank's participation in the NAB on Ireland's behalf. This section requires the Central Bank to submit an annual report on the use of ministerial guarantees on the NAB decision to the Minister for Finance. This statement will be incorporated into the annual report on Ireland's participation in the IMF and World Bank which is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas each year, in accordance with section 10 of the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Act 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> Moving on to the trust funds element of the Bill, section 5 provides for the payment of grant contributions by the Minister for Finance to the IMF's Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust, CCRT, up to an aggregate total of €50 million. All proposed payments to the CCRT will be subject to a resolution by Dáil Éireann. Section 6 sets out the mechanism by which grant contributions may be made to existing IMF trust funds as well as those yet to be established. As explained earlier, any proposed contribution will require a ministerial order, followed by a resolution of Dáil Éireann. Like the CCRT, payments up to an aggregate total of €50 million may be made to each individual trust fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> Section 7 amends section 3 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act 1957 to provide for the payment of grant contributions to the IMF trust funds and to reflect the fact that the "ESAF Trust" has been renamed the "PRGT". Similarly, section 8 amends section 1 of the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Act 1999 to replace the definition of the "ESAF Trust" with the definition of the "PRGT". It will also amend section 4(5) of that Act to increase the total aggregate amount that may be paid to the PRGT to €75 million. Taking into account the total contributions to the ESAF trust or PRGT to date, this amendment will facilitate further grant payments up to an aggregate maximum of approximately €50 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> Section 9 repeals section 163 of the Finance Act 2010. This was intended to amend the Bretton Woods Agreements Act 1957 to provide for a borrowing agreement between Ireland and the IMF. As Ireland's 2010 borrowing agreement with the fund lapsed without taking effect, section 163 of the Finance Act 2010 is redundant so a repeal of that section is in order.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> Section 10 is a standard section defining the Short Title of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> We are living through a particularly turbulent time. Having emerged from a pandemic, we are now dealing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has brought a new set of challenges for the world as a whole. Multilateral co-operation has formed the basis of the global response to the Covid-19 crisis and will do so again in facing down the unconscionable aggressions of Vladimir Putin.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> Multilateralism is also the cornerstone of how Ireland engages with the world. As a small, outward-looking nation, Ireland, throughout our history, has both benefited from and contributed to such international co-operation. Ireland must continue to play an active role in supporting the multilateral system.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> Given its key role in fostering economic stability and global growth as well as acting as the <i>de facto</i> global lender of last resort, the IMF is a critical part of that system. This legislation, facilitating Ireland's participation in the NAB decision and payments to IMF trust funds, is another important step on Ireland's journey to re-engage fully with the IMF. Moreover, it is a strong demonstration of our commitment to multilateralism and of our long-standing support for the world's poorest people in their time of greatest need.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> I look forward to a constructive debate. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">I am sharing time with Deputies Andrews and Ó Murchú.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill. This legislation has been well flagged and has had a long gestation before reaching the Dáil. It is to be welcomed that we now have the legislation before us for scrutiny. The aim of the Bill is to facilitate the State's participation in the International Monetary Fund's new arrangements to borrow, NAB, and streamline procedures for contributing to IMF trust funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> Before considering in detail the provisions of the Bill I want first to reflect more broadly on the role of the IMF. The year 2019 marked the 75th anniversary of the 1944 conference in Bretton Woods, which led to the creation of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development - now the World Bank - and the International Monetary Fund. In many respects the Bretton Woods era ended in the 1970s. Bretton Woods was a dollar order, with the American dollar the only currency that was guaranteed convertibility to gold and as the currency of most international trade. The Bretton Woods order had obvious advantages for the United States, but it also allowed European states to control capital flows from their respective countries and into the United States. For its architects, the system had a crucial role to play in halting capital flight and allowing governments to manage interest rates in pursuit of full employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> Spurred by the oil crisis, this order was ultimately ended by the decisions of President Richard Nixon between 1971 and 1974 to abandon fixed exchange rates, adopting the floating exchange rate system and the removal of capital controls. The post-Bretton Woods era was a new world with enormous ramifications for the global economy. Public and private debt rose massively, unemployment increased and the post-war system was replaced by a neoliberal system. However, the institutions of the World Bank and the IMF survived.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> The stated role of the IMF since its inception has been to promote international financial stability, exchange rate stability and monetary co-operation. It ensures confidence by making the general resources of the IMF temporarily available to members, reducing the duration and severity of balance of payments imbalances. It has not always met these objectives, instead imposing structural adjustment programmes that have led to increased inequality, poverty and social breakdown in lower-income countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">However, its role and importance cannot be dismissed on these grounds. On the contrary, it is because of its importance that the historical programmes it has imposed have been so damaging. Its role is crucial. It includes the facilitation of international trade, promotion of employment and sustainable economic growth and the reduction of global poverty. A core responsibility is the provision of loans to member countries that are experiencing actual or potential balance of payments problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> Resources for IMF loans to its members are provided by member countries, primarily through their payments of quotas. Multilateral and bilateral borrowing serve as a second and third line of defence, providing temporary and supplementary resources. The new arrangements to borrow, or NAB, constitutes a second line of defence to supplement IMF resources to cope with an impairment of the international monetary system. Through the NAB, member countries and institutions lend additional resources to the IMF. In January 2021, a reform of the NAB took effect following consents from NAB participants, almost doubling the size of the NAB to $521 billion for the period from 2021 to 2025. Activation of the NAB requires support from 85% of eligible participants. The core provision of this Bill is to allow the State to participate in the new arrangements to borrow facility within the IMF.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> I now wish to turn to particular provisions of the Bill. Section 2 provides for the approval of Ireland’s participation in the NAB decision, whereby the Central Bank, acting in its capacity as Ireland’s fiscal agent to the fund, will be responsible for providing a loan to the IMF in the case of a call on the NAB. Under the terms of the NAB decision adopted on 16 January 2020, the State committed approximately €2.3 billion. Section 2 grants the necessary powers to the Central Bank to perform the obligations and exercise the rights arising from Ireland’s adherence to the NAB decision, namely, the provision of a loan or promissory note to the IMF in the case of a call on the NAB. Since the original NAB decision was adopted by the IMF executive board on 27 January 1997, the NAB has been renewed on eight occasions. Under future NAB decisions, the size of the credit arrangement to be provided by participants may increase, decrease or remain unchanged.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> Section 3 provides that all proposed amendments to the NAB decision will be referred to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration. If the amendment to the NAB decision creates a charge on public funds, the approval of Dáil Éireann will be necessary before the Minister can consent to the new decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> Section 4 provides for a guarantee by the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank to cover the repayment of the principal and interest on any sum advanced by the Central Bank to the IMF under the terms of the NAB decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> Section 5 provides for the payment of grant contributions by the Minister for Finance to the IMF’s catastrophe containment and relief trust, CCRT, unless opposed by Dáil Éireann by way of resolution. Payments to the CCRT will be made from the Central Fund. The CCRT provides grants for debt relief on IMF loans to eligible low-income countries hit by catastrophic natural disasters or public health disasters. Section 5 limits total aggregate payments to the CCRT by the Minister for Finance to €50 million. The IMF also provides concessional financial support through the poverty reduction and growth trust, PRGT, tailored to low-income countries, LICs.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> Section 6 provides for the payment of grant contributions by the Minister for Finance to IMF trusts or contribution-based financing mechanisms, including the CCRT and PRGT. Section 6 also provides that the Minister may make grant contributions to a “prescribed trust fund” up to a maximum aggregate total of €50 million for each individual prescribed trust fund. In addition, it imposes a collective aggregate limit of €325 million on grant contributions to all prescribed trust funds, the CCRT and the PRGT.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> Ireland joined the IMF and the World Bank in 1957 as part of a process of deepening our engagement and integration with the global economy. The legislation governing Ireland’s membership of the institutions is the Bretton Woods Agreements Act 1957, which has been amended several times. As is well known, the IMF is not averse to loading the loans it issues with ideological conditions that have often stunted the economic and social progress of developing countries. Neoliberalism must be abandoned if global inequality is to be reduced and sustainable development achieved. Ireland itself has experience of this ideology and its consequences, having been subject to a programme of austerity under the troika. After long advocating policies that put the interest of private capital before those of citizens in developing countries, the IMF has shown signs in recent times of moving course, such as its response to the Covid-19 pandemic and recent criticism of the framework to deal with debt distress. Together with our call for the IMF to recognise that austerity is a recipe for inequality and not a path of sustainable development, we also recognise the need to fulfil our obligations in the international community, recognising the role of institutions such as the IMF and World Bank in the multilateral system. For that reason, I and Sinn Féin support this legislation, which will see Ireland participate in the IMF’s new arrangements to borrow, providing credit to the IMF and its operations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_552">The Bill before us here today is essentially a <i>fait accompli</i>. As the Minister signed us up to this two years ago, it is something of a rubber-stamping exercise. Before I deal with the contents of this Bill, I feel I should mention the Bretton Woods system itself, from which it derives its name, because the IMF, alongside the World Bank, have been with us since the Bretton Woods system was first launched. Indeed, it is fair to say they have now outlived the very system they were born of.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> The Bretton Woods system was the approach to global financial management established after the Second World War. Its architects wanted to ensure the interests of capital did not ride roughshod over those of labour and that big business could not smother wider social concerns in post-war democracies. This system rested upon several things: capital controls, fixed exchange rates and the US dollar, backed by a gold standard as its anchor. There were high rates of taxation on capital which were recycled back through high levels of public investment. The policy target was full employment. It was a time when trade unions were strong and finance was weak. Inequality was low and labour’s share of GDP was at an historic high. In the English-speaking world, it was known as the “golden age of capitalism”, the Japanese called it the “economic miracle” and, following its establishment in 1957, it lasted for almost three decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> What followed then was the onset of neoliberalism and a very different system of global financial management. Capital accounts were liberalised and exchange rates floated with fiat currencies, backed by nothing more than the promise to pay. Low rates of taxation on capital prevailed, with the consequence of low levels of public investment with creaking public infrastructure. Now, the policy target was price stability. Inequality moved back towards the levels of the gilded age, trade unions were weakened and finance was strong and highly mobile. Today, capital’s share of GDP is at historic highs. This era has been given various names from across the political spectrum: secular stagnation, financialisation, late-stage capitalism and so on. Regardless of the term that is used, it is pointing to a system that is not serving the needs or the interests of people. If we want an explanation for populism, that is where we start.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> We support this Bill but we also have concerns. We have concerns about whether the IMF has finally woken up to that reality. The IMF, to its credit, has been on something of a journey of self-reflection in recent times. Its research department has led out on this and it has produced important research papers which question ideas that it once held to be conventional wisdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">Its path-breaking article, "Neoliberalism: Oversold?", concluded that "Instead of delivering growth, some neoliberal policies have increased inequality".  It has produced important research supporting the introduction of wealth taxes to help recover from the pandemic and even has produced research demonstrating how taxing the rich is good for growth. This is a far cry from the disastrous trickle-down economics we once got. My only concern is whether the IMF's board of governors have joined the research department on the road to reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> The Bill will mean our participation in the NAB facility. As part of this, we will contribute to IMF loans to eligible countries in difficulty. We have no problem supporting those in need. However, those loans will come with conditions. In the past, such conditions have included increased labour market flexibility, which has been code for lowering wages, loosening employment rights and weakening trade unions. It meant undertaking pro-cyclical measures like reducing government borrowing and raising interest rates in a time of recession. Conditions have included signing up to structural adjustment programmes, which has meant the privatisation of public goods, the fire sale of state assets and the deregulation of markets. This Bill will rename the enhanced structural adjustment facility trust as the poverty reduction and growth trust. I hope that symbolises something more than just changing the name on the label of the loan product. I hope the IMF board of governors has learned from the mistakes of the past, just as its research department has. I hope the IMF recognises that we need to get back to a system of global financial management more akin to the Bretton Woods system than what we have today. There is a major realignment taking place in the world and the unipolar moment is coming to an end. </p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_558">I agree with much of what has been said. We agree with this and want to make sure we are part of the IMF's loan infrastructure. We are a long way from the original concepts in Bretton Woods. We have moved into a period of free flow of capital where private enterprise takes precedence over everything, including the necessity of our communities and societies. That needs to be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> It is difficult to talk about the IMF without talking about our past experience with it, which was one of austerity. It embedded inequality and poverty. We all get or should get the basic concept that more equal societies work better, are healthier and do better on every key performance indicator, KPI.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> As Deputy Andrews said, a huge amount of work has been carried out by the IMF research facility, including papers on neoliberalism oversold and research into wealth taxes and how they work and into the necessity for a more fitting and better system that works for the entirety of our society. The difficulty has been that the IMF has come in with sets of conditions which have been about privatisation, impacting on workers' rights and austerity. A lesson learned across the European Union was that austerity did not work. During the pandemic, mistakes may have been made but the general idea was that we cannot return to the road of austerity. The thinking was more akin to the US New Deal and the Marshall plan funding of Europe after the Second World War. That is where we have to stay. </p>
          <p eId="para_561"> It was necessary for the State to do the heavy lifting in the pandemic and is necessary for states across Europe to do the heavy lifting in the humanitarian crisis caused by the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin. If we are to deal with climate change and other issues, we will have to lift fiscal constraints and be imaginative on an EU level. We saw that imagination during the pandemic when we were able to do all those things we possibly could not do. </p>
          <p eId="para_562"> We need to get real with the issues we have. We will have 20,000, 40,000, possibly 100,000 or even 200,000 Ukrainians here. It is necessary that we play our part but we all know the housing crisis we have. We are in a different situation and need to show the imagination that elements of even the British Government was able to show post Second World War with the idea of the welfare state. We have to engage in a system of building houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> I accept what the Government has said in the sense that our solutions will not be perfect. That is fine but we need imaginative solutions. We have to be able to fund that and there has to be a conversation across Europe, not just about loosening fiscal constraints but about ensuring there is free flow of capital, particularly for necessary capital infrastructure to deliver for Ukrainians fleeing war and for our people who are suffering from our inability to facilitate them with housing. If we are to deal with the big issues of tomorrow, we have to do things differently. We support this but we hope the IMF has learned from past mistakes. </p>

          <from>Deputy Ged Nash<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_564">The Labour Party will support this Bill, which is by and large technical. I do not intend to use all my time and many of the issues I would be ventilating if I were to do so have been adequately covered by the Minister of State and Opposition Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> The Bretton Woods agreement was a groundbreaking accord forged from the ashes of the Second World War. It created the IMF and the World Bank and, latterly, led to the formation of the UN, the European Coal and Steel Community and other important multilateral institutions out of the devastation of the war. It had at its heart a determination to bring economic and fiscal stability and growth as a means of securing peace and prosperity in a war-torn Europe and world.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> We are, as a consequence of Russian aggression, at an uncertain and insecure point in our history. At times like this we are reminded of the importance of multilateralism and of sovereign states with common principles and objectives working together to secure peace, insisting on respect for international law and rules and the need to support our fellow human beings with the solidarity that being active members of international organisations brings. </p>
          <p eId="para_567"> Our membership of the IMF goes back to 1957. As has been said, it was an important step in the development of our young State as a polity that was growing in confidence, maturing and becoming more aware of its important function in the world. The IMF has had its critics and some, if not all, of the criticism levelled against it has been fair. The terms of the 2010 bailout for Ireland were exacting and stringent. Some €22.5 billion was provided to this State through the troika programme via the IMF to keep the doors open as part of that arrangement. The country was in receivership at the time. Nobody else would lend us money to pay welfare and keep schools and hospitals open. The IMF, the European Central Bank and the European Union were the lenders of last resort. I hope and the evidence suggests that lessons have been learnt by the IMF and other international lenders from that difficult period. </p>
          <p eId="para_568">Since that experience, we have seen the IMF, the EU and the European Central Bank adopt a much more enlightened and, dare I say, Keynesian approach to the challenges faced by the Continent and the globe more generally in the context of Covid-19. If we are to see this country, this Continent and the world reach the potential which exists and if we are to be serious about declaring a war on poverty, building up public services and making this country and the world more equal, then we must see more evidence from the IMF, the EU and the European Central Bank that their ideologies have changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> The borrowing arrangement we experienced from 2010 to 2013, and post 2013, in respect of the arrangements that are still to a degree in place in respect of the monitoring of the Irish economy, was provided under the previous NAB facility. Ireland is currently an inactive participant in the NAB. When this Bill is enacted, Ireland will then fully participate in the NAB, with a credit facility provided to the IMF through the Central Bank of Ireland. As was said earlier in various contributions, this is about providing supplementary resources to the IMF, if and when needed, to help states to forestall or to cope with and adjust to any impairment in the international monetary system. This is a temporary measure ahead of quota increases apportioned to each member state to ensure the ongoing adequacy of IMF resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> Given the current uncertainty, it is welcome that Ireland is stepping up and accepting and fulfilling its international obligations in a spirit of solidarity. At this uncertain time, we do not know what kind of turn this continent and this world will take and we must ensure that we are always stepping up and taking on our responsibilities as a wealthy, mature and confident state in the global system to support countries that may experience difficulties in future.</p>

        <speech by="#CormacDevlin" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Deputy Cormac Devlin<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_571">I welcome this opportunity to discuss the latest amendment to the Bretton Woods agreement. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for bringing this Bill before the House. My party, Fianna Fáil, will be supporting the Bill. As the Minister of State has indicated, this legislation facilitates Ireland's continued involvement in the IMF's new arrangements to borrow and implements the decision adopted by the executive board of the IMF on 16 January 2020. The Bill facilitates Ireland's participation in the 2020 NAB decision, and future decisions, by means of a credit arrangement with the IMF that will be provided by the Central Bank of Ireland, acting on behalf of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> The Bill amends the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Act 1999 to reflect the renaming of the ESAF Trust as the PRGT and increases "the aggregate amount of grant contributions that the Minister for Finance may pay". The Bill also amends the Bretton Woods Agreement Act 1957 "to provide for the payment of grant contributions by the Minister for Finance in respect of the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust, CCRT, and trust funds established or to be established by the IMF in accordance with Article V (2)(b) of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund". These measures are important in order to ensure that Ireland can fully participate in the programmes of the IMF. The PRGT is an opportunity for low-income countries to access interest-free loans for capacity-building activities that can boost domestic revenues, manage public finances and regulate financial systems, while progressing towards the UN sustainable development goals, SDGs. The catastrophe containment and relief trust supports low-income countries impacted by the most serious of natural disasters, such as those we have seen in recent years. It also assists countries battling public health disasters, such as infectious disease epidemics, with grants for debt service relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> As of December 2021, $976 million of funding support was approved for 31 countries to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. The fund was previously accessed to support Ebola-afflicted countries such as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Given the current post-pandemic uncertainty and Russia's despicable war in Ukraine, international organisations like the IMF provide an important safety net for many countries and make an important contribution to the rules-based order. Undoubtedly, the recent increases in energy prices and input costs to food and materials caused by the war in Ukraine will have an impact in Ireland and other EU states. However, EU states have the capacity to deal with these crises. Increases in the costs of energy and food, in particular, may have a significant destabilising impact on lower income countries, causing great suffering for millions of people. International bodies like the IMF provide an important safety net in these circumstances. I should say, however, that their role and their financial assistance in those circumstances must be reviewed and it must be ensured that the finance provided is used for the correct purposes. That said, I welcome Ireland's enhanced participation in this programme and I will be supporting the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_574">I am happy to contribute to the debate on this Bill and to tentatively welcome some of the provisions. I would, however, like to raise a few issues. Perhaps the Minister of State could respond to some of my questions in his wrap-up or at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> Despite my strong reservations about the IMF and some of the activities it has engaged in and continues to engage in, I state my support for the trusts referred to in the Bill and the intentions behind them. The catastrophe containment and relief trust allows the IMF to provide grants for debt relief to the poorest and most vulnerable countries hit by catastrophic natural disasters or public health disasters. That relief on debt service payments frees up resources to meet exceptional needs created by the disaster, as well as for containment and recovery as might be necessary. The poverty reduction and growth trust, then, gives low-income countries concessional financial support to help them achieve, maintain or restore a stable economy that is consistent with poverty reduction and sustainable growth. That concessional support through the poverty reduction and growth trust is currently interest free.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> While the IMF undoubtedly has its problems, these are eminently worthy causes. I wonder, therefore, whether the limits allowed for in sections 5, 6 and 8 are too low? What we are talking about here are Ireland’s contributions, which are not made on any kind of regular basis, to programmes that give debt relief to poor and vulnerable countries via grants and cheap loans. Yet the grants from Ireland to the catastrophe containment and relief trust are limited at €50 million, a paltry enough sum. Contributions to the poverty reduction and growth trust are limited at €75 million, and I am informed that roughly €25 million has already been contributed.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> It seems likely that the IMF will be involved in some form with the refinancing of Ukraine's debt, and probably with helping to finance the rebuilding of Ukraine's infrastructure once the war with Russia concludes. It is likely that other countries affected by war will need similar assistance, and this is before we talk about the critical need to help finance low-income countries' climate change mitigation and adaptation and transition to low carbon economies. Prescribed trust funds may be the way the IMF finances these areas, so I again wonder whether the limits defined may be much too low? I also note that the European Central Bank recently gave its technical opinion on the Bill and noted that: "the draft law does not currently explicitly cover exchange rate risk on moneys advanced by the Central Bank of Ireland”. Will the Minister of State give his opinion on this aspect of the Bill and whether he believes there is a need to make future alterations accordingly?</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> As the Minister of State is aware, the value of special drawing rights, or SDRs as they are commonly known, is based on a basket of currencies. The euro rate for SDRs was: 0.8104 in Dec 2019; 0.8485 in Dec 2020; and currently stands at approximately 0.8.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">So when we talk about a potentially maximum loan of 1.9 billion SDRs, we know the euro value can change a good deal. It seemed to me when reading it that the European Central Bank technical opinion paper raises the questions of who will be responsible for managing the exchange rate risk, what mechanism will be used and, if the Central Bank is to manage the risk, how it will be compensated by the Exchequer for doing so. None of this is specified in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> All of this, however, is to assume that the manner in which the IMF awards financing is without its problems, which of course we know it is not. To assume so would be to ignore both its recent history and its current activities. The Covid-19 pandemic has dealt a huge blow to every country and many governments have struggled to meet the urgent needs of their populations during the crisis. The IMF has stepped in to offer extra support to a large number of countries during the pandemic but at what price does this support come?</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> If we want to gain an understanding of the policy direction that the IMF intends to take in the aftermath of the unprecedented crisis that is Covid-19, we only need to look at the Oxfam briefing paper from last August entitled Adding Fuel to the Fire. According to the report, as of last March, 85% of the 107 Covid-19 loans negotiated between the IMF and 85 different governments indicated plans to undertake fiscal consolidation, that is, austerity, once the health crisis abates. This trend is clearly observable in the publicly available loan documents and we have not heard anything about that from our Government or the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> The IMF's initial advice to governments was to spend as much as required to mitigate the severe impacts of the Covid-19 crisis. Oxfam’s research finds the IMF is now encouraging countries to go down the path of austerity as the pandemic subsides. Some of the terms in the loan documents involved austerity measures beginning as early as before 2020 concluded. The IMF has historically advised countries facing high deficits and debt levels to adopt fiscal consolidation and this is despite strong criticism from civil society and academia about the dangers this poses. These dangers have been confirmed by the IMF's own research, including the landmark 2013 working paper on the distributional effects of fiscal consolidation, which showed that the austerity measures it championed have typically had profoundly negative distributional effects by raising inequality, decreasing wage income shares and increasing long-term unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> The most commonly proposed austerity measures in the IMF loan documents include pay cuts and pay freezes, increases to VAT which we know is a particularly regressive tax and general public expenditure cuts. As usual, the most severe impacts are likely to be borne by the same sections of society that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, which are women, low earners and vulnerable groups. Covid-19 has already increased inequality in countries across the world and austerity would make this worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> A little more than four months ago, I stood here in the Chamber and questioned aspects of the Stability and Growth Pact from the point of view of the insufficient flexibility it provides when countries are faced with extenuating needs and circumstances. My concerns around the conditions attached to IMF funding are very similar. The Social Democrats and I are very worried that the conditions attached to IMF loans and grants might be such that we are giving with one hand and taking with the other, tying low-income countries into another cycle of austerity. This Bill gives me a rare opportunity to raise this important matter in the Dáil Chamber because it is not talked about enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> The IMF has too often pursued and prioritised economic growth and macroeconomic stability above all else. Our Minister for Finance is very much inclined to take the same kind of approach. I listened to him recently at an IBEC briefing when he spoke about the headline figures for the public finances. They were all fine but he did not look below them and at the difficulties that so many of our citizens are encountering with housing in particular but also with the high cost of living and the inadequacy of so many of our public services. For decades, the IMF has influenced governments the world over through lending, technical assistance and surveillance. It has pushed them to adopt contractionary fiscal policies at the expense of other important considerations, including equality and the social well-being of their populations.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> Few developed countries know better than Ireland the negative effects of being locked into a cycle of austerity by terms attached to IMF loans. Parties that implemented many of these policies are slow to accept the contention of many economists that the pro-cyclical fiscal tightening implemented across Europe in the last decade and a half likely played a significant role in prolonging recessions and increasing unemployment in many countries, including here in Ireland. It is what the evidence now suggests and, unfortunately, the Oxfam report I refer to indicates that whereas the IMF has made strides in its own research and discourse, occasionally sounding the alarm bells on inequality, it has remained insistent on recommending harmful austerity policies in the aftermath of crises.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> I wonder what checks there are, if any, on how Irish money might be used within the catastrophe containment and relief trust and poverty reduction and growth trust, and whether any of the harmful conditions I refer to will be attached to that money. Have these concerns been raised by our Government at all or highlighted? My concern is that they have not, and given Ireland's recent history, we should be all too aware of those concerns. They should have been raised at the highest level in respect of potential for similar conditions being attached to this money. I would like clarification on those points.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_308">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_588">It seems the IMF and Bretton Woods institutions are keen to rebrand themselves and this Bill seems to be linked to that effort by the IMF. The infamous structural adjustment programmes that were imposed by the IMF on this country and many other countries in the developing world or those which hit major economic crises have proved utterly disastrous because of the conditions linked to these loans provided by the IMF and World Bank. The global interventions of the IMF have been just a litany of disaster where the conditions attached to so-called financial support from the IMF were such that they made bad positions worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Invariably, the conditions that were attached to the loans were those of austerity, privatisation and deregulation. They were a way in which the wealthy countries of the world, a little bit like loan sharks but on a more sophisticated level and a grander scale, could dictate policy to countries that were recipients of those loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> For much of the neoliberal period, for want of a better term, since the late 1970s or early 1980s, the damage wrought by the IMF and the World Bank was inflicted on developing countries in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. With the economic crash of 2008, the damage came a hell of a lot closer to home. The infamous troika of the IMF, the European Commission and the European Union imposed conditions of austerity on foot of loans, supposedly to bail Ireland out after the financial crash created by bankers and developers. The cost was absolutely crippling to this country. We still have an enormous debt of €230 billion. Because of low interest rates, that debt is deemed to be sustainable. If interest rates begin to rise, however, which is almost a racing certainty, at a certain point that debt burden could become absolutely crippling. Bad as that is, the debt burden imposed on ordinary people as a result of the crimes of bankers, developers and the Governments that facilitated them was also linked to cruel and senseless, utterly counter-productive austerity demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> The legacy of austerity remains with us, most obviously in the form of the housing crisis. Social housing provision - direct State construction of public housing - was effectively halted for more than a decade. We are paying a very bitter price for the demands of the troika to impose austerity in the context of public spending. It has left us with a chronic housing crisis inflicting extraordinary misery on ordinary working people just looking to put a secure, affordable roof over their heads. The origin of that crisis predates the austerity programme but it became worse by multiple factors as a result of the IMF troika loan programme. We are dealing with the consequences of that now. We can also see it in our health service. Tens of thousands of staff were taken out of the public health service as a result of the austerity measures and we are dealing with chronic capacity deficits in our health service today. There are hundreds of people on trolleys because we butchered the health service to get the supposed bail-out from these institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> It is also worth pondering the connection between IMF policies and war. Particularly now that we are considering the horrors of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, it is worth considering the connection between war, civil breakdowns and IMF loans and structural adjustment programmes. These are rarely commented on. It is rarely said that preceding the current conflict in Ukraine, a structural adjustment programme imposed by the IMF was in place, imposing neoliberal policies and austerity on the people of Ukraine and doing considerable economic damage to that country.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> Prior to the Balkans war, the civil war that tore Yugoslavia apart with the horrendous crimes of ethnic cleansing and the rise of horrific forms of nationalism in the Balkans, there had been a structural adjustment programme imposed by the IMF involving crippling austerity and wholesale privatisation of the public and state enterprises in that country. In fact, before the Balkans war there had been massive revolts by working people. Regardless of ethnicity, Serb, Croat or Slovenian, together and united, working class people were on the streets protesting against IMF austerity. It is arguable and I am convinced it is the case that part of the reason there was a bloody civil war in the Balkans, the first encroachment of this kind of serious war and conflict in Europe since the end of the Second World War, was that when the ordinary people in the former Yugoslavia revolted against IMF privatisation and austerity, the leaders of the Yugoslav regime decided to play the nationalist card in order to divert attention, divide and rule and deflect legitimate anger against economic austerity into a horrible campaign of nationalism and ultimately of ethnic cleansing and war. It is important to remember that.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> Preceding the Arab Spring was the imposition of structural adjustment programmes in places like Egypt by Hosni Mubarak and in other regimes in north Africa and the Middle East, imposing crippling austerity and the wholesale privatisation of industries. Privatisation was always linked to corruption because the states that were willing to privatise state enterprises inevitably privatised them to the benefit of their mates, the clique around the Government that was imposing them. It is a bit like in this country when we privatised telecommunications and created billionaires like Denis O'Brien. They were the people who benefited. Russian oligarchs came from the wholesale privatisation of state enterprises and industries in the Russian economy. They created this whole layer of horrible oligarchs who then controlled the former state industries. From that is produced the sort of horrible regime we see with Putin.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> That scenario is not limited to Russia, as horrible and obnoxious as its particular manifestation in Russia is. It is a more global phenomenon whereby the insistence of the World Bank and the IMF on linking loans to privatisation and austerity has proved disastrous and has usually assisted in the destabilisation of countries and often in the production of civil wars, certainly of wholesale corruption and often full-scale war. The warring brothers of those who ran those states played cynical games, whipping up militarism in order to deflect popular anger away from themselves and onto scapegoat groups or launching wars in order to divert people's attention away from the real problem, which was the impact of neoliberalism being pushed down their throats by the IMF and the World Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> It no surprise against that background that the IMF wishes to rebrand, as this Bill sets out to do. Instead of the infamous structural adjustment, we now have much more benign sounding grant and loan programmes such as poverty reduction and growth and catastrophe containment and relief. It sounds beautiful but has anything actually changed? The states that dominate the IMF and the World Bank are the wealthiest and most powerful. Inevitably, they exercise their influence on the conditions attached to loans given to poor countries, which are forced to go looking for these loans and then swallow the conditions attaching to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Inevitably, the wealthy countries attach conditions that are beneficial to them and which, almost invariably, operate to the detriment of the people who take the loans. The latter find themselves in hock to these institutions and, in effect, subject to their demands and whims.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> There has, perhaps, been something of a recognition among some of these institutions, and among some of the big western powers which dominate them, that neoliberalism is a disastrous experiment that has failed. We saw some evidence of that recognition during the Covid crisis. When one is faced with a public health emergency, one realises, for example, that a privatised health service is not really a very good idea. Suddenly, it dawns on people that having a two-tier health service, with a public service that is overrun and private hospitals that have excess capacity but can only be accessed by people who have the money to pay exorbitant levels of private health insurance, is not the best type of health system to have facing into a public health emergency in which the health of every person is linked to the health of everybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> Unprecedented measures were taken during the Covid crisis, including the integration for a brief period of the private health service with the public health service. Of course, it was still done in the neoliberal way. Instead of fully integrating and absorbing the private health service into a fully public, single-tier national health service, the Government just paid out huge amounts of money to the private owners of the private system. There was a refusal to break from the privatised model and we see the same with housing. Yes, there is a recognition that we are facing a housing crisis and that a massive mistake was made in doing what the IMF and others told us to do after the crash of 2008, which was to stop building public housing. However, it is clear we have not really learned that lesson when we look at what is happening now. The vast majority of so-called social housing is still being sourced from private developers under Part V of the Planning Development Act, as amended, through leasing arrangements, through the purchase of property from those developers and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> There has been some rhetorical shift by the institutions we are discussing in the way they seek to brand their operations, whether at the international level of the IMF or at the state level of countries like Ireland. However, it is seriously doubtful whether there has been any real and fundamental shift - in fact, I am certain there has not - away from the neoliberal mindset that produced such a disastrous economic crisis in 2008 and such a disastrous response to it in the form of structural adjustment programmes. Of course, horrendous as it was, what we suffered was minor compared with what many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America suffered in the 1980s at the hands of these institutions. I take the vague recognition on their part that the neoliberal model has failed and needs to rebrand itself as a sign of there being pressure on them, and on governments, to begin to shift their thinking. There are very serious questions, however, as to whether they will, in fact, shift their practice or if the change is merely a rebranding and we will continue to see the same disastrous conditions attached to loans, particularly when things begin to get tight.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> Considering this country's current debt burden, we may well suffer very serious consequences as a result of the moneys owed to the sorts of institutions that imposed such disastrous conditions on the loans they gave after the crash of 2008. My colleagues and I have made the argument for writing off these debts, an argument that was resisted hotly by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, with the Green Party switching its position depending on whether it was in opposition or in government. Those debts should have been written off for many of the countries in the developing world on which they were inflicted in the 1980s and 1990s. It remains my opinion that they should be written off today. In the case of such catastrophe loans and loans dealing with poverty, they often simply fill the gap created by the conditions that were attached to loans that were given previously by the same lenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> Rather than simply rebranding the structure whereby wealthy countries and wealthy people lend countries money to fill the gaps created by the previous, disastrous mistakes made by those lenders, we should be thinking about a new international order and eliminating the inequality that requires countries to take these kinds of loans in the first place. We must eliminate situations whereby countries are, in effect, subject to an economic system that is dominated by very large corporations and the states associated with those corporations, which use their incredible wealth to grab hold of resources and markets in order to increase their profits. Never are they interested in the welfare of the people in those countries. Their only interest is in how lending money and attaching certain conditions to it can possibly increase their sphere of influence or their access to certain markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> I am not, therefore, holding my breath on the rebranding of the IMF. If it feels the need to do such rebranding, it is demonstrative of the fact it can no longer stand over the disastrous priorities and policies it has pursued for the past 20 years. Perhaps this rebranding will create the space in which we can argue for a fundamental break from the disastrous policies of neoliberalism and for a different type of international order that is about meeting the needs of society - the needs of human beings - and using the incredible wealth that exists in our world to satisfy people's basic needs for housing, health, education and decent infrastructure and public services. If we went for that sort of emphasis, we might see fewer wars and less military conflict of the terrifying sort that is happening in Europe, Yemen, the Middle East and many parts of the developing world.</p>

          <from>Deputy Cathal Berry<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_604">I welcome the Minister of State's opening statement, which was very detailed, technical and useful. I also welcome the Bill, which was supposed to have been pushed through some 15 years ago. Unfortunately, tragic events overtook us at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> The initialism "IMF" is, for good reason, quite an emotive one for people in this country. It is synonymous with our economic crash and the terrible national humiliation that led to the bailout, the troika and the years of austerity, the tail end of which are still with us even to this day. To be fair to the IMF, of the three components of the troika, it was the least bullish and the least hawkish on those austerity measures. Unfortunately, it was our own people, namely, the ECB and the European Commission, that were the most zealous in inflicting austerity on us. That said, the IMF did not help but it was, at least, the lesser evil of the three. I am glad to see that over the past number of years, the ECB, the European Commission and the IMF have changed and improved slightly, although there is plenty more to do. In particular, the IMF's performance during the pandemic in providing low-cost finance to resource poor countries has made a difference. I only wish that we had applied the same response to the financial pandemic back in 2007 and 2008 as was applied to the Covid pandemic, in which case we would not be in this terrible situation now, particularly in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> I am reassured by the Minister of State's comments on the refinancing of IMF loans. It is welcome that all the IMF loans that were provided to this country have been repaid or at least refinanced in full. I am encouraged by the vast majority of comments made by colleagues in this debate. Most people in the Chamber recognise the need for the IMF as a lender of last resort that is available to countries that are going through periods of particular tragedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">It is important that low-cost concessional loans be available. I am particularly interested in the debt relief aspect. I do not believe we spend enough time debating debt relief in this Chamber. We have suffered from the effects of large debts ourselves. Many of us have travelled in and lived in resource-poor countries across the global south and will be aware that debt relief is an area on which we should be focusing more.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> I have a couple of small points. I welcome the Bill but have some concerns, which I will outline. Could the Minister of State confirm in his closing remarks or a briefing thereafter that if we contribute to the NAB, the money will not come from the Exchequer but from special drawing rights, SDRs, in the Central Bank, effectively putting it off-balance-sheet? I accept the money going into the trusts will be Exchequer funding. However, could it be confirmed that the NAB does not involve Exchequer funding but Central Bank money?</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> On the low-interest loans — the concessional loans — how does Ireland influence the rate the IMF charges resource-poor countries? Can we influence the associated conditionality? Is it through the Minister for Finance or do we have technocrats and individuals sitting on the IMF board who can have an influence and push Ireland's values from that perspective? How can Ireland, particularly with its seat on the Security Council and as a country that is not afraid to express its values across the world, effect a greater amount of debt relief across the world?</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> I am not sure when the Central Bank last briefed Deputies. The Minister of State might consider arranging for it to brief finance spokespeople from the various parties and Independents, or at least giving it the opportunity to brief us on the activities of the IMF, particularly in respect of debt relief, concessional loans and any associated conditionality.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> I welcome the Bill and am happy to support it. I would be grateful to have the clarifications, either in the Minister of State's closing remarks or a briefing thereafter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OssianSmyth" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform" eId="spk_310">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_612">I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this debate. I appreciate the Opposition's support for this Bill. Although it is described as technical, it does provide for what will be very practical and useful funds for poverty reduction and disaster relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> I will address some of the questions raised, starting with those of Deputy Berry, the most recent contributor. His first question was on whether the NAB would be funded by the Exchequer. As I understand it, it is an investment from the Central Bank and will bear interest. It does not involve any cost to the Exchequer. Trust funds, however, are grants and would be expected to be given for earthquake relief or hurricane relief, for example. There is no repayment; they are cash grants. Provision has to be made within the Bill because there is a cost to the Exchequer associated with what the total amount of money could be.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> The next question was on our input into the conditionality, how it is set and whether it is done by the Minister for Finance or officials. I shall give a more complete and better-informed answer on Committee Stage, rather than trying to answer the question right now.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> Deputy Berry's next question was on whether the Central Bank could provide a briefing for spokespeople. I see no reason why not. I will contact the Central Bank and ask whether it will brief Opposition spokespeople. Although this Bill is just addressing the NABs and trust funds, this is an opportunity to discuss the operation of the IMF in general. Of course, the IMF is an emotive subject because the IMF was involved in a programme in Ireland in its not-very-distant history. It is not the case that the IMF arrives at one's door; it has to be invited in. When you have nowhere else to turn, you write to the IMF and invite it to come to your country, and then you form a programme with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> Several Deputies raised the question of conditionality. A country applies to the IMF, in its capacity as a lender of last resort, for funding and agrees a programme with it. Sometimes the conditionality is controversial, and that is what leads to Deputy Berry's question about how it is formed. Conditionality is a core part of the agreement. It has always been. Under its articles of agreement, the IMF is required to establish adequate safeguards for the use of its resources in order to ensure loans to member countries are repaid as they fall due. This ensures resources will be available to other members in need. The safeguards include policy conditionality, implying that a country's government and the IMF must agree together a programme of economic policies before the fund provides a loan to the country. Essentially, conditionality serves two purposes. In the first instance, it helps countries solve balance-of-payments problems without resorting to measures that are harmful to national or international prosperity. At the same time, it safeguards IMF resources by ensuring the country's balance of payments will be strong enough to permit it to repay the loan, thereby protecting the fund's limited resources. While I recognise the significant challenges that conditionality can pose in the short term, as we can recall from our recent experience, the overarching goal of these measures is always to restore or maintain balance-of-payments viability and macroeconomic stability while setting the stage for sustained high-quality growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> Deputy Shortall asked about the exchange rate gap between SDRs and the euro. In other words, if we say in this legislation that a certain maximum amount of money can be spent on the trust funds and NABs, where that sum is denominated in euro but we actually pay in SDRs, with an exchange rate movement between the two, how do we cover the risk? That is a technical question. As Deputy Shortall said, the ECB had raised a question about this when looking at draft legislation. The answer to the question is that the Central Bank of Ireland, acting as Ireland's fiscal agent to the IMF, will take on the financial risk associated with making payments on behalf of the State in response to a call under the NAB decision. However, given the financial independence required of the Eurosystem and national central banks under Article 130 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, pursuant to which member states may not put their national central banks in a position in which they have insufficient financial resources to carry out their Eurosystem-related tasks, the Central Bank of Ireland requires a ministerial guarantee to participate in the NAB. This ministerial guarantee will cover all financial risk, including credit risk in the unlikely event that the IMF fails to repay, either in full or in part, the amounts owed, and exchange-rate risk arising from the fluctuations in the euro–SDR exchange rate. Exchange-rate risk would occur in the event that the euro appreciated over the term of the loan against the SDR, meaning a decline in the value of the principal amount and interest repayments under SDR terms relative to the euro amount on the Central Bank's balance sheet. Notwithstanding the two circumstances outlined, the purpose of the guarantee is to provide full compensation to the Central Bank for any shortfall. The specifics of the guarantee have been set out in a template letter, agreed in advance by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> Deputy Berry and possibly others raised debt forgiveness. It was asked why the IMF requires a repayment from people in need. As Members can see, the trust funds do not require repayment; they are purely grants. In the case of a loan made by the IMF, if the members decide to forgive the debt, the members concerned can forgo repayment. They can always do that if they feel it is the wisest move. In this regard, we have only to consider the fund's comprehensive response to Covid-19, with financing totalling €173 billion provided to 93 members to support their pandemic response and recovery, as well as vital debt relief made available to 29 vulnerable low-income members.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">As we move into the next phase of the crisis, the IMF continues to provide additional financing, technical assistance and policy advice to help countries recover and to build back better.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> The IMF has reacted quickly to the devastating developments in Ukraine, approving emergency financing of $1.4 billion on 9 March and disbursing these resources to Ukrainian people that same day. As some Deputies may be aware, the IMF managing director has publicly committed to providing additional assistance to Ukraine. Fund staff have also been in daily contact with the Ukrainian authorities and has worked with its ministry of finance and central bank on crisis management measures to allow for the continuous functioning of the Ukrainian economy. Furthermore, the IMF also stands ready to provide support for Ukraine's neighbours. For example, the fund is request considering a request from Moldova to increase the financial assistance available under existing extended credit facility-extended fund facility programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> To reiterate the intention behind the Bill, it is to allow Ireland to play our part in fortifying the fund and securing its ability to respond to future crises. It also provides another avenue for Ireland to fulfil its obligations as a strong economy, allowing us to channel critical support to those countries that need it most. The Bill, once enacted, will put in place a credit arrangement for up to €2.37 billion to be provided by the Central Bank, which may be drawn upon by the fund subject to an activation of the NAB and a specific call on the activated NAB by the IMF. This is a loan arrangement. Any money provided by the Central Bank in response to a call on the NAB will be repaid in full by the IMF. Furthermore, the fund will pay a daily interest rate on the sum which will be paid to the Central Bank on a quarterly basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> Similarly, with regard to potential grant contributions to IMF trust funds, I do not underestimate the significance of committing to future payments up to an aggregate total of €325 million. Again, it is important to reiterate that, unlike the NAB, contributions to IMF trust funds will be in the form of grants with no expectation that the State will be ever be repaid. The IMF uses trust funds in order to deliver a sustained and targeted impact for a specific objective. For example, the poverty reduction and growth trust, PRGT, was used extensively during the pandemic to provide concessional loans at zero interest rates to low income countries to support economic recovery and the response to Covid-19. </p>
          <p eId="para_623"> Beyond the pandemic context, the catastrophe containment and relief trust, CCRT, allows the IMF to join international debt relief efforts for poor countries hit by the most catastrophic of natural disasters. The IMF perspective trust fund, the resilience and sustainability trust, will provide affordable long-term financing to support countries as they address macro critical longer-term structural challenges such as climate change, pandemic preparedness and digitisation. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_628">I thank the Minister of State. I want to raise the important issue of the fuel concerns affecting all sectors in the road transport sector in Ireland, in particular smaller private bus operators. There is not a community in Ireland that is not serviced by the work undertaken by many coach hire companies. The work they do to promote tourism is very much appreciated throughout rural Ireland, as is the work they do with sporting clubs and other organisations in our communities that heavily rely on the private bus sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_629"> It is important to mention that millions of road journeys are provided annually in Ireland because of the coach hire business in terms of school runs. We have to acknowledge that the sector has a significant role to play in reducing traffic on our roads and encouraging people to transition to public transport. The sector is under particular pressure at the moment when it comes to increasing fuel costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_630"> As the Minister of State might be aware, 90% of school transport routes in the country are provided by private bus operators on behalf of Bus Éireann. However, the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland, CTTC, recently conducted a survey which showed that 95% of school transport providers cannot guarantee provision of transport for students up to June without some degree of subvention. I wanted to mention this, which was brought to my attention by the representative body for coach tourism and operators around the country, for the information of the House. That gives us an indication of how serious this particular issue is. </p>
            <p eId="para_631"> Progress was recently made, which was very welcome and was brought about by the hard work of the Road Haulage Association. I want to compliment its president, Eugene Drennan, and the officials working in that organisation for the efforts they have secured from Government and I want to thank the Government for coming to the table in that regard. </p>
            <p eId="para_632"> However, we need to do more for coach and bus operators around the country. more than 11,000 people are directly employed in the sector and it contributes over €600 million to our economy on an annual basis. When it comes to tourism and school transport, it is absolutely essential. The Government has to do more. I sincerely hope that in the absence of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, departmental officials are listening to my contribution. I will raise this issue directly with him on his return and I ask the Minister of State to bring my contribution to his attention. </p>
            <p eId="para_633"> I would appreciate if the Department can take into account just how hard fuel prices are hitting smaller operators, that is, those who have fewer than 20 vehicles in their fleet. No matter what parish we go to in the country, we will always find at least one, if not many, coach companies. The Government should identify this as an issue and work specifically with the sector. </p>
            <p eId="para_634"> I welcome the fact that meetings with the CTTC and the Government will take place in the coming days. Overall, we must provide additional supports similar to those currently in place for the haulage sector, such as a direct subvention on a temporary basis. We need to recognise that we are now in a war situation internationally and we need to make sure that we look after this sector which, quite frankly, was thriving before the pandemic. Unfortunately, the industry was hit by the pandemic and is now being hit by high fuel prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_635"> The price of a barrel of oil has stabilised but unfortunately it is still high. Supply is outstripping demand, but it is only a matter of time before we return to the situation that pertained three or four weeks ago. That is highly concerning. The Government needs to act urgently.</p>

            <p eId="para_637">I thank Deputy O'Connor for asking about the supports available for private bus and coach operators during this wartime period which has led to elevated fuel prices. I am answering this question on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ryan.</p>
            <p eId="para_638"> I understand the Deputy's question relates specifically to the possible provision of fuel supports to the bus and coach sector similar to those recently introduced for hauliers. As the House is aware, a whole-of-government approach is being adopted in regard to the Ukrainian crisis. I am pleased to advise that a high-level group has been established in the Department of Transport to monitor and respond, as appropriate, to the crisis and its impact on the transport sector. This group is informed by other Departments, agencies and transport stakeholders and seek to ensure a co-ordinated response to the evolving situation. </p>
            <p eId="para_639"> As part of this process, contingency plans in the Department and across all agencies are being reviewed and refreshed, where necessary, in response to the potential impacts on the transport sector, including those related to fuel costs. As Deputies will be aware, on 9 March the Minister for Finance announced a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil. Excise duty on petrol was reduced by 20 cent per litre and by 15 cent per litre of diesel, with these reductions to remain in place until 31 August 2022. This measure was introduced to help ease the burden on all citizens and businesses across the economy. </p>
            <p eId="para_640"> Subsequently, on 15 March the Government approved an emergency support measure for licensed hauliers in order to address the cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices. The support is targeted.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">A temporary grant scheme will provide a payment of €100 per week for each heavy goods vehicle over 3.5 tonnes as listed on a road haulage operator's licence. The scheme will operate for a period of eight weeks and will be reviewed thereafter. The estimated cost to the State of the temporary response to these extraordinary circumstances is €18 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_642"> In responding to the Deputy's question, I wish to be clear that licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, particularly in areas that are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services. In recognition of the important role of these operators throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government has provided temporary financial supports for certain licensed commercial services with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. This temporary support was initially introduced for a period of six months in June 2020. However, owing to the continued impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue, the supports have been extended on several occasions and more than €60 million has been provided to the sector to date under these schemes. In acknowledgement of the continuing difficulties facing the sector, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, recently approved an extension of the supports for a further three months, until 30 June 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> As the Deputy is aware, fuel costs have increased substantially since the commencement of the scheme in June 2020. I can confirm that the NTA has funded the operators for actual fuel costs throughout this period and will continue to do so throughout the extension of the scheme. Moreover, to ensure the continued operation of public transport service in rural areas, the NTA recently provided an additional level of subvention to support Local Link operators in the delivery of these services. These supports are provided to operators who are on fixed-rate contracts and therefore receiving no further increases to their based contracted rates. The funding has currently been provided to cover the costs for the first quarter of 2022 and this is a once-off payment initially. The situation will be monitored on an ongoing basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_644">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I appreciate the information that has been brought to light and that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is aware of it. That is welcome. It is good to hear about the extensions. However, putting it in an overall picture, we must remember that more than 41 million passengers are taken to school by coach operators. That is a staggering statistics that indicates the scale of the service provided to people across the country. Two thirds of operators have experienced fuel cost increases of more than 60% in the past 12 months. That is very concerning and enormously costly. We need to mind the gap in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_645"> A particular issue raised at the committee - unfortunately, there was little time to discuss it because of the time constraints and the number of people who were present - is the lack of alignment in State contracts and Government procurement. The committee was told by the CCTC that the lack of alignment is troubling. It is seeking to have a legally enforceable fuel variation clause introduced in school transport contracts so that operators have protection against extreme variation in fuel costs. That struck me as a sensible suggestion that we could consider, particularly from the point of view of the Department of Transport. It would be welcome if a degree of security could be provided in that area. If that is something the Minister of State can bring back to the Minister, I would appreciate it. </p>
            <p eId="para_646"> I am very concerned about the national oil reserve. As all present are aware, under international law the State is obligated to have a supply of 90 days for the country in the event a supply crisis was to emerge. Considering how close we came to such a crisis a number of weeks ago in the context of the security situation in Russia and Ukraine, which looks like it will deteriorate, we need to be on standby as a Government because the damage that would be done to all sectors of the economy, including the sector to which I refer, if there is a supply crisis is enormous. This is an island nation and we need to be on standby to secure and access that reserve, much of which is kept off the island of Ireland. As an island, we need to make sure we have the security in place to access that reserve if necessary.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ossian Smyth<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_647">I thank the Deputy. The first item I will address relates to procurement and State contracts. I refer to situations where a person entered a contract with the State to provide a service but the cost to the person of diesel has greatly increased. This is a specific case of a problem in procurement where inflation has made the economic reality of the contract difficult for the contractor to fulfil. An information note was produced by the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, which reports to me through the chief procurement officer, to address inflation questions, particularly in the context of the construction sector, but not on fuel. I will discuss that with the OGP and I am willing to revert to the Deputy specifically on that question.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> On the issue of the National Oil Reserve Agency, NORA, I agree the value of the agency is clear to see. This is not just an Irish system; it is across the EU so that the whole of the EU has a 90-day buffer. It is incredibly important that we have it. If the Deputy has further questions on it, I will be happy to engage with him in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_649"> The Department of Transport and the National Transport Authority, NTA, regularly engage with operators on the evolving situation and the impact the Ukrainian crisis is having on operators' ability to provide public transport services. I reassure the House that CIÉ operators hedge the vast majority of their fuel in advance and, as such, are largely sheltered from the current rising fuel costs. As I outlined earlier, the commercial bus operator, CBO, supports have now been extended to the end of June 2022 and additional levels of subvention have been provided to support Local Link operators with managing the rising costs of diesel and in order to ensure the continuation of these essential services.</p>
            <p eId="para_650"> In addition, the Department of Transport participates in the EU contact network, which comprises all member states and representatives of the European Commission. This network, established in response to Covid-19, is now solely focused on the Ukrainian conflict. At its meetings, the network receives reports on transport-related impacts at the EU-Ukraine border, including the impact on supply chains. As the House is aware, more than 10,000 refugees from Ukraine have arrived in Ireland to date. A cross-departmental team is looking at all issues arising in the context of Ireland's response to the humanitarian crisis as residents of Ukraine seek refuge away from the war zone, including the consideration of any further measures that may be needed to assist people fleeing the conflict. In this context, the NTA recently decided to allow free travel for newly arriving Ukrainian refugees on any public service obligation public transport service from point of entry to their end destination.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_660">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, who has stepped in at the last minute because the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, is detained elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> In 2019 and 2020 there was a significant increase in the number of media reports of tragic and premature deaths of people experiencing homelessness. As there is no count or record of such deaths, it was not clear whether those deaths represented an increase but, given the significant number of deaths, this House called on the then Minister at the time to commission a report to establish the extent to which this problem was growing, but also to try to understand the reasons for these premature deaths in order to try to ensure that, in future, the numbers would reduce, if not eventually be eradicated.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> At the request of the then Minister, the Dublin Region Homelessness Executive commissioned an interim report on mortality among the single homeless population. Dr. Austin O'Carroll, who is one of the leaders in the field in terms of providing front-line supports to this cohort of very vulnerable men and women through his general practitioner, GP, practice in north inner city Dublin, produced the report. I have it before me. It is an important piece of work. I say this with no disrespect to anybody in the House, but we are talking about a group of people who, for the most part, the system does not care about. We need to be honest about that. These are single people, many of whom have severe levels of addiction, often interspersed with severe levels of mental ill-health. A significant number of them come from backgrounds of extreme poverty. That cycle of poverty, addiction, mental ill-health and homelessness has meant that, if we are brutally honest, they are at the very bottom of the list of political priorities for most people.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> The publication of the report was groundbreaking because it acknowledged that although there were insufficient data to reach definitive conclusions, the age at which those in this group of people die is frighteningly young.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">The deaths that have been occurring are, in many cases, eminently preventable if only we would learn from the mistakes of the past and improve the supports for this group of people into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> The report, I understand, created some considerable tensions between the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, and the HSE, which led to it being downgraded to an interim report and a promise of a HSE-funded longer-term study that has never materialised and I am not even sure if it is being produced. That speaks volumes in itself. </p>
            <p eId="para_666"> There are very important recommendations in Dr. O'Carroll's report, such as, for example, an increase in trauma-informed care to ensure adequate supports for this very vulnerable group of people in great need and a far greater provision of appropriate step-down and move-on accommodation. It also crucially recommended that critical incident reports, or what some people call adult safeguarding reviews which look back at the circumstances that led to such untimely and premature deaths, are also carried out. This is not to apportion blame but to learn what failed in the systems to try to ensure that these types of deaths were reduced and, potentially, eradicated in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_667"> Central to Dr. O'Carroll's report was a need for greater multidisciplinary interagency working. Very often the deaths that take place are in the transition of an individual from healthcare, to mental health care, to homeless services, and in those gaps, when there is a handover, the lack of properly co-ordinated and integrated interagency care led to crises and ultimately to deaths.</p>
            <p eId="para_668"> What provoked me to table this request was that at the very start of this week, as I am sure Members will know, there was yet another tragic death of a young man who died in a tent in the north inner city of Dublin. We still do not know the reasons for that individual's death but, like so many others, he died far too young. I want to express my condolences to his family and to his friends but let us take this opportunity to ask what we can do to tackle the causes of these premature deaths to try to ensure that they are reduced and, ultimately, eradicated into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_669">I thank Deputy Ó Broin for raising this particular matter. We should acknowledge that Dr. Austin O’Carroll has done a considerable service for the category of people referred to in this report.

            <p eId="para_670">I thank the Ceann Comhairle. I thank Deputy Ó Broin for asking this question and it is a very serious matter. I am answering this question on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The Minister has asked me to express his sadness at the news of the death of a man who appears to have been sleeping in a tent in Dublin city centre. This is a tragedy and I extend my sympathies to his family.</p>
            <p eId="para_671"> The deaths of people availing of homeless services are of great concern and are being taken very seriously. It is important to establish the circumstances involved and that the response is based on the best knowledge and evidence available.</p>
            <p eId="para_672"> A review of homeless deaths was undertaken on behalf of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive by Dr. Austin O’Carroll and the review analysed the available data concerning deaths in homeless services for 2020, to identify learning for homeless and health services that could help tailor the provision of care to homeless people. Dr. O’Carroll notes that the most important step in reducing mortality among the homeless population is the reduction of long-term homelessness. The report notes that the Housing First model is the optimum approach to achieve this objective. Housing for All commits to the continued expansion of Housing First with more than 1,300 additional Housing First tenancies planned over the next five years on top of the 756 tenancies that have already been created. The report makes recommendations in the areas of data collection and analysis and a pilot study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally is being undertaken by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health. Dr. O’Carroll’s report also identifies that the co-operation between different agencies and service providers is of critical importance. Under Housing for All, a new national homeless action committee has been established with all of the key Departments, agencies and stakeholders involved. The overarching objective of the committee is to ensure that a renewed emphasis is brought to collaborating across Government to implement actions in Housing for All. </p>
            <p eId="para_673"> The improvement of health outcomes for socially excluded groups in society is a key priority for the Government. The HSE, through its national service plan 2022, has identified priority action areas with regard to healthcare services for people who are homeless. Among these are the development of a single integrated homeless case management team in Dublin and the implementation of the health actions in Housing for All for people who are homeless in order to provide specialist addiction and mental health services that are appropriate to their needs. Further recommendations that are currently being implemented are the continued support for the roll-out of specific harm reduction approaches such as opioid substitution treatment and increased naloxone provision. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities to continue to deliver the appropriate measures to support all individuals experiencing homelessness, including those with complex needs.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_674">I thank the Minister of State for his response. I will make just a couple of comments by way of reply and make a number of requests for him to raise with both the line Minister and also, possibly, with his colleagues who have responsibility for healthcare.</p>
            <p eId="para_675"> First, in respect of Housing First, the Minister of State is absolutely correct in that both the report and Government policy recognise the importance of Housing First. The difficulty is that the target for Housing First exits from homelessness has only been increased by 50 per year to 250. We have 3,000 single adults in our emergency accommodation system at present, not all of whom have the very high level of complex needs that we are talking about, but many do. Some 250 Housing First placements a year are nowhere near adequate. In many cases the support services being provided are not being adequately funded for long enough. That is important because there is a period of vulnerability for people who are going into Housing First in the period of time immediately after exiting either street homelessness, sofa-surfing or emergency accommodation because, in many cases, they are removed from what was their support and contacts network, and from their cultural capital. In many instances in other jurisdictions, that actually leads to an increase in potential mortality during that period of vulnerability and that needs to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_676"> I welcome the fact that the Health Research Board is undertaking this work but I understand that it was meant to start this two years ago and it would be good to hear from the Minister for Health at some point about its progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_677"> Crucially, one of the great innovations that was made by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and Dr. Austin O’Carroll during the Covid-19 period was the creation of medically supported shielding units, where those with the highest level of vulnerability to contract Covid-19 and, therefore, potential death, were put into new bespoke units. Not only were they protected from Covid-19, something I wish to commend the Government, the DRHE and the front-line staff on achieving, but what happened when we put these people into own-door accommodation? All aspects of their lives started to improve, not just their protection from Covid-19 but their physical and mental health, and addiction management also. These were temporary facilities and one of the things that the Government should urgently consider in the context of this debate is the making of permanent facilities as transitional accommodation, rather than moving people back into emergency accommodation. </p>
            <p eId="para_678"> I thank the Minister of State for his response urgent and I urge him to raise this very serious matter with the two line Ministers. I hope that we can return to this issue at a later stage for a further update. I thank the Ceann Comhairle.</p>

            <p eId="para_679">I thank Deputy Ó Broin. From talking to people who work directly in homelessness services, I am told that while addiction is very commonly a factor in homelessness, it is not always the case. Sometimes it is mental health and sometimes it is simply losing one’s money and not being able to manage economically in a very expensive housing situation. On many occasions it is addiction and the way to tackle that is to address the causes of addiction and doing this requires further funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">I will take the Deputy’s comments to the Minister of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the need for more Housing First places which are not sufficient, given the number of people who are homeless. Additionally, I will also act on the Deputy’s request to ask the Minister for Health for a report on progress of the Health Research Board’s work in this area. I will also take on board the Deputy’s comments about the success of the shielding units and the own-door accommodation and will bring those to the Minister for Housing, Local Government, and Heritage.

        <speech by="#ChrisAndrews" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_708">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_709">I thank the Minister of State for arriving. I know he had other plans, but such is life. This is a Bill to amend the Planning and Development 2000 and to repeal section 97(3)(b). The Bill arises because of the scrapping of height guidelines by the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> There are a number of strands leading to this Bill. First, under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, each private developer must provide 10% social housing under the rule commonly known as "Part V". Second, the scrapping of the height guidelines by the previous Minister with responsibility for the environment in 2018 creates a lacuna in the legislation. Third, any site that is 0.1 ha or smaller is exempt from the requirement to transfer units to the local authority for housing under Part V. Small sites which were just for developing up to ten homes were and are exempt from providing public housing. This Bill is not about going after the family home, a second home or even a small builder building a few homes. It is about stopping developers taking advantage of the gap in the legislation. I have a question which the Minister of State might answer later. If there is already an exemption for small developments of fewer than ten homes, why was there also an exemption based on the area or footage of the ground? This Bill will remove this exemption by deleting section 97(3)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> We realised there was a gap in the legislation when planning permission was granted for the development on York Road in Ringsend of a seven-storey apartment block. Having been granted permission for seven storeys, the developer then reapplied for planning permission to change the build to a 15-storey apartment block with 48 new homes and no public housing. The second application for 15 storeys was rejected, but if it had been granted the developer would have been exempt from making the 10% contribution to the local authority for public homes. If the new plans had been given the go-ahead, this would have set a dangerous precedent for the development of the area, likely to be replicated elsewhere throughout the city and in other urban areas and built-up settings. It should be noted that the approved application for the seven-storey development has not even been started. The developer has not gone near it.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> The main reason the 15-storey application was blocked is the huge campaign that was organised by residents, Shay Connolly, Orla Murphy and many others. They engaged with residents, knocked door to door and let people know what was happening. They mobilised and held public meetings outdoors in the park during the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a campaign that was successful and engaged people. It was really positive. People were interested and it was great to see the energy that campaign brought. This building would have been as high as Liberty Hall, towering over artisan red-brick cottages. It would have been, effectively, a Trojan horse for developer-led development in Ringsend. It would have allowed developers to build higher and higher along the river front of the Liffey and up to the quays. The campaign raised great awareness within the community of the issue of developer-led developments and the need for the community to be active, aware and mobilised. That is certainly what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> This development would be very much out of character with the street, where the average homes are red-bricked artisan one-storey dwellings, next to a school. These small artisan dwellings would have been towered over by a 15-storey block. Many other sites are building fewer units, yet they make a contribution through Part V. The loophole has understandably angered the local community. Ringsend is an area that has a considerable need for social and affordable housing, as is the case in communities across the inner city. Two and three generations of families are living in two-bedroom and three-bedroom flats and towering beside these families a developer is trying to avoid his obligation to provide public housing. It is rubbing salt into the wounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> The community has developed and worked on this area to make it fantastic. It is an attractive area with parks, sports clubs and community facilities. Developers are now swooping in on the back of the fantastic work the community has done over the years to make Ringsend an attractive area in which to live. These developers are going to maximise their profits and avoid doing anything for the community. They will avoid it like the plague. All they want is to maximise their profits. This developer is a prime example of this mindset, and will just make money for the investors. The developer will promote and market this development using all the facilities the community has fought hard to build over the decades. At the same time, the developer is avoiding providing housing in the area, which has a real need for social housing. The amount of three generations living in a single house in Ringsend is phenomenal. It is not inconceivable that a developer with 0.3 ha could divide the site into three smaller parcels using different shell companies and build 120 homes and still be exempt from the 10% contribution under Part V. Stranger things have happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> Ringsend must have a local area plan developed or the area will continue to have developer-led housing and community development. The residents' community development group made a submission to the development plan which outlined a vision for Ringsend and a vision that other communities can aspire to. Across the inner city many working families are being locked out of home ownership. The cost of a one-bedroom home is now €442,000 in Ringsend. It is absolute madness. Ordinary people, families and workers are expected to pay that. They just cannot afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">They are being pushed out of their communities and pushed down the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> The cost of building a unit at the new glass bottle site is between €400,000 and €500,000. The development has stalled because Roadbridge has gone into receivership, but that is a separate issue. These will not be affordable to ordinary families. These homes will be occupied by the vulture funds and the well-paid staff of the high-tech companies. There are many high-tech companies and they have thrown a lot of shade at the local community. In other areas in the inner city, developers are looking for small plots of land and will be going higher and higher with the price. At the same time, they will avoid the provision of social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> The high-tech companies are coming into the inner city and require homes for their staff. The lack of housing and the cost of what is there is a big disincentive when trying to attract staff. They are investing in property and this is pushing up the prices of homes, putting them out of the reach of ordinary workers and families. I would not be surprised if they were not looking at a site for future development to house their staff. It is natural. This is what they have to do, it is what they are being allowed to do and it is what they are being encouraged to do. This is understandable but it has a huge knock-on effect on what is traditionally a working class community. This community has been neglected for years and is now being squeezed out as a result of Government policies that give free rein to the big high-tech companies. Government policy allows the high-tech companies and the vulture funds to work hand in hand to come in, buy up properties and drive working families out of the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> Affordability is an issue. If the gaps in legislation we have identified are not sealed, as is the intention behind the Bill, developers will be able to avoid providing any public housing. The numbers on the social housing list are increasing daily. Without public housing, these communities will become increasingly fragmented. Flat complexes in inner-city communities have been neglected for decades. Look at the conditions in the Pearse House, Macken Street and Whitefriar Gardens complexes. It is unbelievable that families are allowed to live in these conditions. They are hard-working families who have worked throughout Covid. They are expected to live in these conditions. There are rats, raw sewage is overflowing and there are lighting defects. It is dangerous to live in many of these flats, and it is just not right. This neglect has to be reversed. Our inner-city communities deserve better and our city deserves better. Developers will be able to slip through the fence and avoid providing housing on small plots of land unless the Bill is passed. This is not only an issue in Ringsend; it will happen throughout the city and the remainder of the country unless the gap in legislation is filled. This Bill would fill that gap.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterBurke" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Housing,_Local_Government_and_Heritage" eId="spk_358">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Peter Burke)<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_720">I thank the Deputies for their opening remarks. The Government will not support this Private Members' Bill which seeks to make changes to the exemptions that exist in relation to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. The primary objective of Part V is to ensure an adequate supply of housing for all sectors of the existing and future population. In this regard, Part V allows local authorities to purchase a percentage of land at existing use value, which is less than the enhanced market value, and use this land for the provision of social and affordable housing. The Part V requirement is currently 20% for social and affordable housing, with a minimum of 10% to be used for social housing. Section 97(3) provides an exemption to these Part V requirements for residential developments of four or fewer dwellings and sites of 0.1 ha or less on application to the relevant planning authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> The Private Members' Bill, if enacted, would remove the land area exemption. A small number of sites in urban areas consisting of five or more dwellings have been Part V exempt because the relevant site was smaller than 0.1 ha. It seems it is the Deputy's intention to correct this perceived anomaly via the proposed Bill. Part V requires that a specified percentage of any land zoned for residential use be made available for social and affordable housing. However, section 97 of the 2000 Act provides that an exemption to this can be made for developments consisting of four or fewer houses or a development of houses on an area of land of less than 0.1 ha. The Private Members' Bill, if passed, would remove this land area exemption entirely.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> It is acknowledged that a small number of sites in urban areas that consist of more than five houses have been Part V exempt. As the Deputies know, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Daragh O'Brien, recently made a series of changes to Part V of the Planning and Development Act, through a series of amendments under the Affordable Housing Act 2021. This was in line with the commitments made in the programme for government and the recommendations made by the review of Part V carried out by the Housing Agency. Principal among these amendments was the increase of the percentage contribution from 10% to a mandatory 20% for social and affordable housing. A central consideration in drafting these amendments was to legislate for increased social and affordable homes for those people and families who need them while at the same time maintaining the conditions that would not impact negatively on the delivery of these homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> The exemptions to Part V contained in section 97 of the Act exist for the same reason and were not considered for change as part of the Housing Agency review. Their purpose is to ensure the continued delivery of much needed homes. If small developments and sites were subject to the same 20% Part V contribution as larger developments, it would make a great many of them unviable and so negatively affect supply. The reasons very small developments can become unviable relate in large part to the cost of inclusion of social and affordable homes in addition to the already high construction costs that arise. These additional construction costs arise from machinery restrictions in small infill sites, the stabilisation of existing adjoining buildings and conservation issues, and they can be substantial.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> Furthermore, the Government is committed to achieving compact urban growth to make our towns and cities more sustainable and more attractive places for investment and for people to live and work. We need to encourage this type of development. Along with transport demand, higher densities and shorter travel distances will also reduce energy demand and use overall. This is increasingly pertinent now against the backdrop of the increasing cost of living and increasing energy costs in particular. Multistorey and terraced buildings in close proximity require less energy and make renewables-based systems of energy distribution, such as district heating, more feasible.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> The national planning framework targets a significant proportion of future urban development on infill and brownfield development sites within the built footprint of existing urban areas. The framework acknowledges that creating more compact development in Ireland has traditionally been more difficult to achieve, but in light of our climate change commitments and the need to reduce carbon emissions, it seeks to encourage much more use of smaller, infill sites for development and for housing in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> The national planning framework is specific in these intentions and national strategic outcome No. 1 states that Ireland will need to deliver a greater proportion of residential development within existing built-up areas of our cities, towns and villages. There will also need to be a new focus on infill development, integrated transport and promoting regeneration and revitalisation of urban areas, pursuing a compact growth policy at national, regional and local level. A range of objectives in the national planning framework seek to deliver at least 40% of all new homes nationally within the built-up footprint of existing settlements, with at least half of all new homes that are targeted in the five cities and suburbs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford within their existing built-up footprints. At least a further 30% of all new homes are to be targeted within the existing built up footprints of settlements other than the five cities and their suburbs. Furthermore, national policy objective No. 11 states that there will be a presumption in favour of development that can encourage more people and generate more jobs and activity within existing cities and towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> The priority must be to develop these smaller sites which can meet the national planning framework’s objectives and the only way to do this is to provide the policy framework and the conditions to incentivise development and not to stifle it. Removing this exemption could have unintended consequences and potentially prevent smaller, residential sites being developed, particularly in our cities, towns and villages. In urbanised settings these sites are already serviced making them ideally placed for development. It is well known that the lack of suitable serviced sites is one of the main obstacles to housing delivery. This is at a time when we need to be consolidating our towns and cities to create a sustainable pattern of living and working. We must build up and not out, and use what we have within urban areas. Not achieving sufficient density in the town centre means that such towns will become more spread out and car dependent, with negative implications for tackling climate change and for promoting and sustaining public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> Housing for All is the most extensive and ambitious action plan for the delivery of social and affordable housing in the history of the State. It brings a coherent and consistent whole-of-government approach to housing policy, to ensure the delivery of housing supply is sufficient to meet demand at a price level that is affordable, accessible and sustainable. A key focus of Housing for All is to ensure that those who wish to purchase a home have sufficient location choice. This is particularly the case for the core of our cities, towns and villages. Housing for All provides for the launching of a programme of compulsory purchase orders to bring vacant units to the market for sale, as well as activating unused State-owned properties for this purpose. This would include underused sites in town and city centres that could be used to yield new housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">With this in mind, we launched the town centre first policy last month. It provides a co-ordinated, whole-of-government policy framework to proactively address the decline in the health of our towns across Ireland and support measures to regenerate and revitalise them and address vacancy and dereliction. Key to this will be the reuse and redevelopment of smaller infill sites in urban areas. Addressing vacancy and maximising the use of existing housing stock is a primary objective of this Government and a number of measures are provided for in the town centre first policy to address vacancy and dereliction.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> Housing for All highlights new funding initiatives such as the Croí Cónaithe fund which is expected to provide funding for serviced sites in towns and support for the refurbishment of vacant properties. This would be in addition to the potential new European regional development fund, ERDF, funding for urban areas, which is still in the process of being finalised. The Croí Cónaithe fund will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> The Part V exemption included in the amended 2000 Act is a key tool in supporting all of these measures. It facilitates the development of very small brownfield sites and in turn creates new homes, builds economic activity and reduces social decay. While the deletion would marginally increase the capture of Part V units in dense urban locations where brownfield and infill development on sites of 0.1 ha or less takes place, it is important to note that the locations where these developments occur is limited to a very small number of urban areas where viability remains a significant issue in delivering supply.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EoinOBroin" eId="spk_359">
          <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_732">I am going to do something slightly different, which is to reason with the Minister of State on the basis of his better nature and knowledge of the planning system. Without any disrespect to him, the speech he has just read out does not deal with either the substance or intent of the proposed Bill. That is not his fault. He was not able to be here because he was at another engagement and so did not hear the proposer's speech. However, the speech he has been given by his officials completely fails to understand the core objective of the Bill. I genuinely appeal to the Minister of State to explain why there is merit in the proposition and, because this is his direct responsibility as Minister of State with responsibility for planning, I ask him to go back to his officials and have a conversation to see whether what we are trying to achieve here can be accommodated in some other way.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> As the Minister of State knows, Part V of the Planning and Development Act was passed in 2000. Back in 2000, there was a reason for there being two exemptions to Part V, these being based on the number of units and the size of the piece of land. Back then, a piece of land of that size could only yield a certain number of units because there were strict requirements in county development plans with regard to the number of units per hectare. The kind of circumstance that has motivated my colleague, Deputy Andrews, to bring forward this Bill was not only not possible back then, but it was not even conceivable. People did not think about building very tall buildings on very small and narrow plots of land, so such developments are now exempt from Part V for no good reason. </p>
          <p eId="para_734"> As we know, some good things and some bad things have happened since them. A good thing is the element of the national planning framework that seeks compact growth. This is one of the issues in the area of planning on which we agree with the Minister of State. We need to see higher density mixed-use developments in our urban centres, particularly in the kind of constituency Deputy Andrews represents, which includes the area of Ringsend. Our buildings are therefore going to go up. My preference is for mid-rise, high-density, mixed-use developments. Others would like high-rise developments and so on. However, there is no doubt that smaller plots of land are going to yield larger numbers of units. If that is done in the right way, it will be a really good thing and we should all be positive about it in our engagements.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> The specific problem that has arisen in Deputy Andrews's constituency that he is seeking address is that, for the first time, a very small plot of land is going to be used to develop a mid-rise or possibly even a high-rise scheme with a very large number of units. It is viable and will be exceptionally profitable for the developer. That is the way the world is. That developer should have Part V units in that development. In this changed context, post Eoghan Murphy's mandatory ministerial guidelines on height and when it is now possible to build mid-rise and high-rise buildings on very small plots, including a plot of 0.1 ha in the case Deputy Andrews mentioned, the Government has to rethink whether some of those developments should involve a Part V requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> This is not about small plots of land in small towns and villages that are going to yield small numbers of units. There may be a much better way of crafting Deputy Andrews's amendment that the eminently more qualified people in the Minister of State's Department could easily draft and present as a Government amendment but it is not acceptable to develop 20, 30, 40 or 50 units on a piece of land of 0.1 ha without a single Part V unit among them. That is the core of this Bill. Anybody who knows the history of Part V - and the Ceann Comhairle is probably the only person in the room who was in the Oireachtas back in 2000 when that Bill was introduced by his Fianna Fáil party colleague, the then Minister - will understand that the purpose of Part V is to ensure there is at least some level of social mix in all developments barring the very small.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> Why is this important? First of all, it is important because we have a social housing crisis. There are currently 60,000 households on our local authority housing waiting lists. There are 60,000 households in receipt of housing assistance payment on short and insecure two-year private rental tenancies subsidised by the State. There are just under 20,000 households receiving subsidies through the rental accommodation scheme, which involves four-year tenancies. Therefore, there are currently 140,000 households that need social housing. That is not including the 7,000, 10,000 or 14,000 households that come onto the social housing lists each year on average. From this year to the end of this Government's term of office, if it lasts the full term, it is going to add 40,000 real social homes to the stock of housing owned by local authorities and approved housing bodies. The Government is only scratching the surface with its current housing plan. Earlier, we had a debate on the need to increase the provision of Housing First to tackle the issue of homelessness among single people. Every single unit of social housing, particularly in the urban areas of Dublin, could help to take somebody out of emergency accommodation or, in the context of the debate we just had about the high rate of mortality among single homeless people, could potentially save somebody's life. Whether it is ten, 20, 50 or 100 units in the city, it would be life-changing for the individuals who would access them.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> The Minister of State is right that the Government has increased Part V provision to 20% although he forgot to mention one absolutely crucial detail, which is that it only applies on land purchased after the enactment of the legislation, that is, after 2021. All of the land purchased before, which will be the subject of the planning permission applications to be made this year, next year and probably the year after that, will only have to have 10% Part V provision. We will have that argument another day. However, there is a need for the Government to revisit this provision. </p>
          <p eId="para_739"> One could ask why the review of the operation of Part V conducted by the Housing Agency did not spot this issue. I believe it is because such development did not happen during the period of time when the review was done. To the best of our knowledge, there had not been any planning applications like the one Deputy Andrews has identified. While there have only been a very small number of such applications so far, Deputy Andrews also pointed out something very important in his opening speech, which is that there is nothing in the law to prevent somebody acquiring a piece of land bigger than 0.1 ha and then separating it out, creating separate designated activity companies and submitting separate sequential planning applications that, if granted, would leave each development exempt. That is completely legal under the current arrangements. </p>
          <p eId="para_740"> I am not asking the Minister of State to support the Bill. Clearly, he will not do so and we will not waste time on a fool's errand. I know he will do his best to defend the position of the Department in his response to my remarks. That is fine. That is his job and I respect him for doing it. However, I will ask him to think very carefully about the proposition. Is it appropriate for a developer to be able to build a development of seven to 15 storeys with two, three or four units per storey on a small site in an inner urban area like Ringsend while not having to provide any units under Part V?</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> I acknowledge the Minister of State for making contact with me before this debate because he was unable to attend the earlier debate. That was a very welcome intervention but I want to bring that debate into connection with this one in the following way. Far too many single homeless people are dying while accessing homeless services. There is a set of complex reasons for this. It relates to how homelessness, addiction, mental ill health and, in many cases, poverty overlay one another. There is a need to tackle all of these issues. In the report we were discussing earlier, which was produced by Dr. Austin O'Carroll for the Dublin Region Homelessness Executive two years ago, one of the things Dr. O'Carroll said was that the single most important intervention is increasing the provision of Housing First. The Government is increasing this provision from 200 tenancies a year to 250 but we need thousands of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">It may not be worded in the way it is in this Bill, but if some reform were made with whatever wording, it could mean that in Dublin city alone, particularly given that we are looking for many one-bedroom units for Housing First, over four or five years we could end up with several hundred additional units on top of the Part V units we are already getting. That would be life-transforming for the individuals in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> The Minister of State is a decent person. We engage regularly at the committee. We have our disagreements but we also have our agreements. I think we have established a relationship at this point. On areas where we can find common ground we try. After this debate is finished and he has said the things he needs to say, he should sit down with the officials and ask if there is a set of circumstances, a certain height of building or a certain number of units on a site of 0.1 ha where it would become appropriate for the Part V provisions to kick in. He can come back to us when it is appropriate with an amendment that does not have the unintended consequences he or his officials feel this one has but also does not have intended consequences of an updated exemption that means that today people can build very tall buildings on very narrow sites without any Part V requirements. I believe that is a very reasonable proposition. I know the Minister of State is a reasonable person and, therefore, my appeal might have some impact on him talking to the relevant officials and coming back at a later stage. The problem raised by my colleague, Deputy Andrews, is genuine.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Peter Burke)<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_744">I apologise that I missed the start of the debate. I was in the middle of a planning advisory forum meeting and I had to depart from that because the Dáil schedule accelerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> I do not come in here to defend things just for the sake of doing it; I need to believe in it in the first instance. That is core to me as a politician. The Deputy has cited a specific example that is unfolding before his eyes. If this proposal were enacted without any due diligence, it would have an effect on the entire country. We will need to have a look at that. I will undertake to talk to the Housing Agency in the first instance because it conducted that wide-ranging review of Part V, which was well debated in this House at the time. Many allegations flew around from left, right and centre about submissions and whatnot. I will engage with the agency and I commit to coming back to Deputy Ó Broin on the matter. I understand the point he is making about scale or if it relates to a sequential development. I will raise those issues with the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> Unfortunately, I cannot accept this wording because of the consequences it would have across the country based on one specific example without due diligence. I think that is a reasonable response at the moment. I undertake to come back on that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews<recordedTime time="2022-03-24T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_747">I agree with everything Deputy Ó Broin said. It is very disappointing and the residents in Pearse Street and Ringsend will be equally disappointed. The Minister of State listed off a range of measures, but he did not say what the negative unintended consequences of the Bill would be. It will protect communities. The application in Ringsend was for 15 storeys and there were going to be 48 units on a site of 0.1 ha. Five of those units should have gone to public housing. That means five homes lost and five families on the housing list who will miss out because of that exemption. The developer clearly sees it as a loophole. No one is saying the development needs to be stopped. Someone developing 40 or 50 units should make their contribution to public housing as set out in the law for everybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> As the Minister of State knows, the housing list is getting longer every day. It is not about stopping development. At comment was made to me recently about this Bill. The individual said it is getting harder to build. This is not about stopping anybody from building. It is not about going after a small developer building three or four units. This is this is about the developer who sees an opportunity to drive a wedge through a loophole in the law. I ask the Minister of State to explain to me how closing this loophole would have negative consequences for other communities. I cannot see that.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> I ask him to give some indication as to what those negative consequences would be if this were deleted. There is already an exemption for people producing three, four or five homes. Why do we need to have an exemption for somebody developing on 0.1 ha? The studies were done before the guidelines. In 2018, the then Minister, Eoghan Murphy, scrapped the height guidelines and developers can now go as high as they like. It will be like having Liberty Hall in the middle of Ringsend, towering over the artisan dwellings and the one-storey cottages. It is completely inappropriate. The developer was going to sell this particular development on the back of all the hard work the community has done. That will be replicated throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> I find it hard to see any unintended consequences. I again ask the Minister of State to point them out. The developers are taking advantage of the hard work of volunteers in the community. This Bill would close a loophole in the legislation that needs to be closed. Like Deputy Ó Broin, I ask the Minister of State to come back with something else to close the loophole.</p>
