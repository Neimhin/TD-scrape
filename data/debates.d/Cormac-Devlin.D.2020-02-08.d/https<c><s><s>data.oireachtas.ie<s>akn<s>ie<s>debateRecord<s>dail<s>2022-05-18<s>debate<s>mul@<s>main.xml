            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T09:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue on the floor of the House. I want to raise with the Minister of State the lack of school places for children with autism, which is now forcing students from south Roscommon to travel up to 100 km each day to avail of an education. I know of two children in south Roscommon who are travelling up to 100 km. Another two children I am aware of, in County Westmeath, must also travel such a distance. The children in County Roscommon will have to make a daily journey over to Glenamaddy from next September to access second level education in an autism-specific class.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> I have spoken to a local campaigner, Claire Earley, and Senator Carrigy, who raised this issue in the Seanad last week. Between us, we have figured out that there will be 11 children leaving primary school in the catchment of Athlone and south Roscommon next month who have no local autism-specific school place. We all know that children with autism require routine, and their parents know the transition from primary school to secondary school is going to be challenging. What are those parents to say to their children as the latter say goodbye to their classmates? What answer are the children to give to the other sixth-class children when they talk about where they are going to school next September? Securing an appropriate school placement for a child is an anxious time for every single parent, particularly those with a child with additional needs. It makes the experience extremely stressful. The children, if they are lucky enough to get a placement in a school, will have to travel up to 100 km daily. The children I have mentioned are the ones who have been lucky enough to secure a school placement. On average, the 11 children are facing a combined weekly journey of over 4,500 km to go to school because of the failure to provide autism classes in local schools, despite the fact that this has been known to the Department for the past eight years. This is just not good enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> We are now coming to the end of the school term and parents need certainty. Pupils themselves deserve it. Several parents of children already in the local post-primary school system believe their children would make better progress in an autism-specific class, if available. Senator Carrigy and I believe there is a need to accommodate in the region of 15 to 18 post-primary pupils within the Athlone catchment area. We in Athlone pride ourselves on the comprehensive range and standards of the schools and colleges we have.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">However, our own children, who should be entitled to an education in their town, along with their schoolmates and brothers and sisters, will not be able to avail of that. I do not think it is too much to ask that we provide that to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> The Minister of State tweeted last night that she is going to invoke section 37 of the Education Act 1998 to direct schools to make places available in areas which desperately require additional special education needs places. One of locations is Athlone, which needs places at post-primary school level. I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment that she will invoke section 37 within the catchment area of Athlone to ensure these children are not travelling 4,500 km every single week to try to access an education.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Deputy Josepha Madigan)<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T09:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_8">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Senator Micheál Carrigy has an interest in this area and has discussed it with the Deputy at length. I am the first Minister of State with responsibility for special education. There are a number of different measures that we have put in place over the last year in terms of ensuring we have sufficient capacity to meet the growing demand in particular areas, not just in Dublin and Cork, but in Athlone, Roscommon and other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> I will be meeting the National Council for Special Education tomorrow and I will bring up Athlone and Roscommon. The National Council for Special Education is saying to me that, at present, it is confident it will meet the demands for special class places and special school places for September for both Roscommon and Athlone. In Athlone, Moate and Roscommon, there are currently 42 special class places for autism students in post-primary and, although the Deputy might not be aware of the fact, there will be the opening of two new post-primary special classes from September of this year in Scoil Mhuire gan Smál in Roscommon and Scoil Mhuire in Strokestown, which will mean an additional 12 places there as well. For any of those children in Athlone - the Deputy may have mentioned there are eight children there - the National Council for Special Education is also telling me, through its special educational needs organisers, that it will have sufficient capacity for those children for September of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> In direct response to the Deputy’s questions, if it is the case that there are not sufficient places for children with additional needs in the areas he has mentioned, then I will have no hesitation in instigating section 37A, particularly in post-primary schools. From the demographics I have seen and from the geographical information system, it seems to me there is this gap between primary and post-primary in particular, not just in the Deputy’s area but in other areas throughout the country, and that is not satisfactory. The Deputy will be aware that the majority of special classes and places in special schools are created via collaboration and ongoing engagement with schools in a cordial and constructive way. I am reluctant to use section 37A because it is a blunt instrument but, nevertheless, it is there for a reason. It is a statutory mechanism that is specifically tasked to me, as the Minister of State with responsibility for special education, and I will use it where I need to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> The forecasting model we have in place since last year has already borne fruit in certain areas and the planning and building unit is now working directly with the National Council for Special Education, in a way that it was not before, on an integrated planning and forecasting process. It shares its geographical system with the National Council for Special Education so we can see building projects in real-time in each geographical area, which is critical. That is on top of the fact that we already had a commitment for the very first time from the Department of Education that all new schools from last year will automatically provide special class facilities and sensory rooms going forward, so we do not have this perennial problem year after year.</p>

            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T09:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">I thank the Minister for her commitment to invoke section 37 if required. While the National Council for Special Education has told the Minister of State that it is confident it will meet the needs, it has not told the parents that. The parents I have spoken to, the parents Claire Earley has spoken to and the parents Senator Carrigy has spoken to have been offered places either in Longford town or in Glenamaddy in north-east Galway. They are local parents in Athlone but that is what they have been offered.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> Although this is outside the Minister of State's remit, the reality is the Department had 93 months to get this right but we are now three months away from those children going into second level and it has not got it right to date. We are one month away from those children leaving primary school and they have not got any indication that they will be provided with a service in their own local catchment along with their brothers and sisters, their neighbours and their classmates.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> At present, there are just three primary schools and one second level school providing autism-specific classes in the wider Athlone area, which is insufficient to meet the current needs. This must be urgently addressed. The primary schools with autism spectrum disorder classes are St. Paul’s in Lyster Street, St. Joseph’s in Summerhill on the Connacht side of the town and at Coosan on the Leinster side of the town. At second level, we have just one school, Coláiste Chiaráin in Summerhill, that has autism-specific classes. There are 57 primary school pupils in local autism classes in Athlone, Ballinasloe and south Roscommon, and despite the demand for more places, no new classes are being planned for this September. As I said, the situation at second level is even more stark, with just 23 students with autism being accommodated at present between the schools in Athlone and Ballinasloe, and children facing a 100 km daily return trip. That is unacceptable.</p>

            <p eId="para_15">I know the Deputy’s commitment to this area, along with Senator Carrigy. As we know. children have a right to an education under the Constitution and it is my job to vindicate that right for them. The first thing we have to do is to find them a special class place, or should I say an appropriate placement, whether a special class place in mainstream or a special school. The second thing that is looked at is the location. Obviously, in an ideal scenario, a child with additional needs, or any child for that matter, would attend a school in their locality. As has happened in the past and as continues to happen, however, that has not been possible for practical reasons, for capacity reasons and for other legitimate reasons that have been offered to us. Nevertheless, we are endeavouring to make sure that children have a place in their area.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> Although parents may not have been told as yet by the National Council for Special Education, there is a reason for that, and it is that there is still ongoing engagement with some of the schools. They are sensitive, confidential discussions and we do not want to do something that would upset that in any way. It sometimes takes a radical shift for a school to make that jump and we want to try to nurture that relationship and bring the school with us. Again, to go back to section 37, I will use it where I have to, but in circumstances where the schools are collaborating and will open the special classes, we should give them the space to do that. I hope the parents will be told in early course when their child has a place because, obviously, they need to plan for September and to make sure they have those places in good time.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> The short, medium and long-term planning is undertaken at a national and regional level. It is based on projected future population demographics and the average percentage of the schoolgoing population requiring special education places. That is a sort of general rule for how this is looked at but there will always be children who, for whatever reason, may have moved from a special class to mainstream, moved from mainstream to a special school or moved to a completely different locality, and it can be difficult to anticipate those sorts of circumstances. We need to allow some room for those types of situations.</p>

            <p eId="para_20">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for her latitude. I want to talk to the Minister of State about the hydrotherapy pool in Enable Ireland in Cavan, which I was very privileged to bring her to see. I want to thank her publicly for the time she spent in Cavan-Monaghan to visit many of our disability services.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> I am sure she was as shocked as I was to see a wonderful facility lying closed when so many children and adults in our disability services could desperately do with such a facility in order to improve their care. The facility cost in the region of €500,000 to build and was opened four years ago. To my dismay, it lies empty and unused four years on. It has to be acknowledged that the cost of the building was not covered by the HSE alone; local people believed in the facility, got behind it and fundraised to see it built. When the building work was completed by Enable Ireland, it went about a recruitment process and put in place a part-time pool attendant in late 2018. Unfortunately, the post holder only remained in place for about six months. The pool has lain empty and the facility has been closed since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> The Minister of State was, as I said, as gobsmacked as I was to see the facility lying empty, the paint peeling off the walls, and the good staff at Enable Ireland being left with an empty and unattended hydrotherapy pool for the past four years. It is nothing short of disgraceful. I got a real sense from the staff during the visit that strong intervention is needed on our part to ensure that the facility is opened, it has the money required to put an attendant in place, put water into the pool, get the service up and running as quickly as possible and bring this integral part of the facility back into play as part of the services required. Enable Ireland recently submitted a business case to the HSE for funding to cover the running costs, including employing a full-time pool attendant at the centre, and that the figure is in the region of €60,000 per annum. Money will need to be spent on remedial works at the facility. This should be doable, considering the overall budget for health care and disability services.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> The Minister of State has a passion for this area, and her visit on that day meant so much to the staff, parents and service users. To see a facility like a hydrotherapy pool which could be used as part of rehabilitation programmes for the area lying idle is disappointing. It is a magnificent facility to have. I understand it is the only one in community health organisation, CHO, 1. For the information of anybody listening to the debate, that includes Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Sligo.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> I would welcome anything the Minister of State can do. As I said, she has been very passionate about all things to do with disability services. However, if it had not been for her visit on the day I would not be as aware as I am that a magnificent building and facility is not being used. The Minister of State had great ideas on the day of her visit about how we could go outside of service users if funding is an issue. Hard work has been done and €500,000 has been spent to put the facility in place. To say that we need money to paint the walls, put water in the pool and provide a pool attendant seems a very shallow answer as to why a pool has lain empty for four years. Perhaps the Minister of State can throw some light on the situation. I appeal her to do all she can to ensure that this is up and running as soon as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Anne Rabbitte)<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_25">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. On a broader level, it provides me with an opportunity to restate the Government's commitment to children and young people with disabilities, as well as their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> In the first instance, I wish to state that I visited the facility in April, to which the Deputy alluded. I saw first-hand the hydrotherapy pool lying idle. The service covers the Cavan-Monaghan area. Following inquiries by my officials, the HSE has advised that Enable Ireland commissioned completion of the hydrotherapy pool in 2018. At that time, it secured some funding for a pool attendant. The pool attendant was there for about six months, and after that we ran into the debacle with Covid. The pool lay idle in 2019, 2020, 2021 and into 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> The Deputy used the term "gobsmacked". I was equally as gobsmacked because I see the value of the hydrotherapy pool in Holy Angels in Carlow, which is used continuously. It is not just used for young people who are listed as having disabilities; it is also open to the wider public in the evenings and at weekends. On another level, it is available for players recovering from various injuries. We do not need to rely on the National Rehabilitation Hospital when facilities are available in local areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> With regard to the opening of the facility, Enable Ireland has submitted a business case to the HSE, which is currently going through the assessment process. It is seeking pay costs for a full pool attendant and non-pay running costs. I understand the figures break down to approximately €50,000 to pay a pool attendant and €10,000 for running costs. In terms of the overall health budget, in particular that part relating to disability, given the value of hydrotherapy for young people and older persons, a figure of €50,000 seems to be very good value for money. We also need to look outside the box in how we deliver therapies. It is not just about going into a room and doing one-to-one work. There are other ways of delivering therapies. As a passionate swimmer, I believe in the role of hydrotherapy. I also believe in the role of rehabilitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> At local management level, the HSE has advised that it will seek funding in 2023. In terms of cost related savings, it should look to see what is available at this moment in time. We should not wait until 2023 to paint walls or put water back into the pool. We should do work on a trial basis to get the facility up running, determine the appetite for the service and create awareness. If there are other hydrotherapy pools and facilities used by the HSE, I ask the wider public to make me aware of that. A pool lying idle is not serving the people of Cavan-Monaghan or the rest of CHO 1.. We walked into the room by accident. It was not part of the visit; I just happened to ask about a wing in the facility. To have the pool lying idle is wilful neglect of the people of the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">I thank the Minister of State for her positive response. There are questions to be answered as to why a pool has lain idle for the past four years. I know there is no point in going back and we need to be positive and look forward, but it is not good enough to say that Covid is the reason why a hydrotherapy pool has lain idle for the past four years. Covid has been going on for two years, but the Minister of State and I know that disability services have been up and running as much as possible, even through Covid. I do not buy that, and I think it is an excuse that can be used. There are questions to be answered when a facility has lain idle for four years. </p>
            <p eId="para_31"> On the positive side, I want the money to be invested and do not want any more delays in getting the facility up and running. The Minister of State is absolutely right. We need to think about the service beyond 4.30 p.m. or 5 p.m. It is a facility that could be used until 10 p.m. each day of the week and at weekends. Breffni county grounds are located beside the facility. If the area outside the service cannot be used, people could use it. I encourage the Minister of State to do whatever it takes to get this open.</p>

Bhíodh sé á thaifeadadh i ngrúpaí do na hoileáin ar fad ach athraíodh é seo roinnt blianta ó shin nuair a socraíodh é a dháileadh ag aon ghrúpa amháin in aghaidh an chontae. Is í an fhadhb atá againn ná nach bhfuil na hoileáin aitheanta mar áit faoi leith ach go bhfuil siad clúdaithe i bpleananna contae. Is minic a bhíonn na hoileáin i gcoimhlint le pobail na mórthíre agus tá deacrachtaí mar gheall air sin.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">Tuigim, ar ndóigh, go bhfuil athbhreithniú ar siúl faoi láthair agus is é sin an fáth go bhfuilimid ag ardú na ceiste seo faoi láthair agus tuigim go raibh grúpaí i dteagmháil leis an Aire sinsearach mar gheall air seo. Impím ar an Aire Stáit an cheist seo a chur san áireamh ag an bpointe seo. </p>
            <p eId="para_35"> Déanfaidh mé cur síos ar na fadhbanna mar gheall air seo. Is é ceann de na fadhbanna is mó ná an cistiú meaitseála 50% atá ag teastáil i gcomhair na ndeontas fiontraíochta. Tuigim gur 75% atá ann faoi láthair ach de ghnáth is 50% atá i gceist leis. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil níos lú deiseanna oibre ar na hoileáin agus gur beag fostaíochta lánaimseartha atá i gceist mar gheall go bhfuil go leor fostaíochta séasúraí i gceist ann. Chomh maith leis sin, tá go leor den fhostaíocht ag brath ar chúrsaí turasóireachta, rud nach raibh mórán de ann i rith 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> Is rud eile a bhféadfaí a chur san áireamh ná go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos deacra an t-airgead a fháil ar iasacht chomh maith. Ní hé amháin go gcaithfí an t-airgead a bheith á mheaitseáil ach, chomh maith leis sin, caithfear a chinntiú go bhfuil an t-airgead ann roimh réidh agus ansin faightear an t-airgead ar ais. Tá deacrachtaí ar leith mar gheall air sin sna hoileáin. </p>

            <p eId="para_38">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Mar a dúirt mo chomhghleacaí anseo, tá fadhb ann ó thaobh na n-oileán de agus an dóigh atáimid ag déileáil leis an gclár LEADER agus tá deis ann é a cheartú anois. Má fheictear ar LEADER amach sa todhchaí ón mbliain seo chugainn amach romhainn, tá fadhbanna faoi leith ag na hoileáin ach níl an Rialtas dírithe air seo mar go bhfuil áiseanna nach gcúitítear níos mó á dtabhairt do na hoileáin i scéimeanna difriúla. Tá deacrachtaí ann nuair atáimid ag déileáil leis na hoileáin i nDún na nGall, mar shampla, mar nach bhfuil an clár seo á riaradh ag grúpaí na n-oileáin iad féin. Má fhéachtar ar na hoileáin ar fud na tíre, tá siad ag déileáil le ceithre ghrúpa agus straitéis dhifriúla agus fadhbanna móra acu mar sin.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> Nuair a bhristear síos é ó thaobh airgid de atá ag dul isteach go dtí na ceantair seo, airgead atá de dhíth, agus má amharcaimid ar an gclár a bhí ann roimhe seo, cífimid go raibh €1 milliún á chaitheamh ar oileáin amach ar chósta Dhún na nGall. Ón mbliain 2014 go dtí 2020, ní raibh ach leath den airgead sin, half the amount of money was spent on the island community in the last LEADER programme by comparison. There is a need to change the way we administer LEADER on the island. It has to be island-specific and administered by those who know the needs of the island and there are many other complications that have arisen.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> Comhar na nOileán have put forward a very serious amount of proposals that should be taken up by the Government to ensure that our island communities have the best start and chance of availing of this necessary funding in the future funding stream.

Mar a bhfuil a fhios againn ar fad, tá costas faoi leith i gceist chun dul amach go dtí na hoileáin. De bharr go bhfuil an costas nó an méid airgid riaracháin a fhaigheann iad siúd a théann amach chuig na hoileáin mar an gcéanna leo siúd a théann chuig ceantar tuaithe nach ar oileáin iad, níl na deiseanna céanna acu an t-eolas sin a scaipeadh. Is fadhb agus deacracht eile í sin.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit as an méid atá ráite aige. The priority here is to ensure that the next LEADER programme is shaped in the way that best fits the communities that need to be served by it. The Minister of State mentioned the amount of funding that is going to be made available. The key issue here for us is not the size of the pot, which in itself is very important when we look at it from a global point of view, but when we look at it from an island point of view, we need to ensure that we are able to spend that money on the islands. There was only one successful application for an enterprise grant on the islands off the coast of Donegal. The Minister of State knows the islands off the coast of Donegal, namely, Arranmore, Tory, Inis Bó Finne and Gola where many people could do with LEADER funding to help them start up businesses in an area that has been ravaged with high unemployment. The co-funding is not fit for purpose and makes it impossible for many people. This is a challenge because we do not have an island-specific LEADER programme. We are asking the Minister of State to implore the senior Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to ensure that when this is shaped, going forward, there is an understanding and a unique position for the islands for co-funding, ring-fenced funding and the administration of same.</p>

I am stating here that there will be a two-step process now. It is possible for eligible groups to apply for approval and to form an LAG before the CAP strategic plan it decided. After this strategic plan has been approved, that is the point at which the different local action groups will be named. I know that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, understands this. I will also say this to her. As Deputy Doherty has said, I am familiar with the islands and we have connected some of them to fibre broadband off the coast and we will be putting particular interest into ensuring that the islands get what they need. These are particular areas which can benefit from renewable energy and need special attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, just for you.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> First, to welcome the Minister and I want to acknowledge the very dedicated team in the Passport Office which is producing on average 20,000 passports per week and the Minister of State’s updated figures may indicate even more than that.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">I also wish to acknowledge the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and his team. They work exceptionally hard to try to put in systems that work for citizens. Before I get into the substance of my motivation in raising this issue, in the past five working days I have had 30 phone calls and six emails on this subject. Overall, my constituency office has received approximately 250 to 260 queries about passport applications in the past few months. This is not just a matter in my constituency. The good citizens of Tyrone and Derry have also been in touch with me through their public representatives. I put that context on the record before turning to the substance motivating my request. </p>
            <p eId="para_59"> I am arguing for a passport office in the north west. I obviously use this as an opportunity to push for it to be located in Letterkenny because of its city status and previous gateway status. I ask that the new office be located somewhere in the north west. It would not be for online applications, because that is going to be the normal process for the renewal of passports and it is working well. I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about this issue. People living in Britain or in the North have the opportunity of going to Glasgow, Durham, Liverpool, Peterborough, Birmingham or Belfast if they wish to apply for a British passport. In this jurisdiction, the options are Dublin and Cork. or London or any of our other embassies round the world. Therefore, citizens living in the north west seeking an emergency passport appointment, perhaps for tomorrow morning, may find there are no emergency passport appointments available tomorrow morning in Dublin. The only option available then to somebody living in the north west is to go to London or Cork. If somebody in the north west is to go to an appointment that may be available tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. in Cork, that means there will be a need to travel to that city and to stay overnight. There is something distinctly wrong about this scenario. </p>
            <p eId="para_60"> I want to put on record today the idea of opening a passport office in the north west. It is worth pursuing because there is a massive gap here in respect of providing equal services to everybody on this island. The emergency passport application costs €150. People from Finglas, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow will find that €150 is still a lot of money, but that is all it will cost them and they may be able to travel by public transport or perhaps be able to nip into the passport office for a few minutes. For people living anywhere up in the north west, however, we are talking about them having to travel the night before and stay in hotel accommodation in the city. This travel will be undertaken on roads that are not motorways and from a region that does not have a train service. Therefore, a massive gap exists in this regard. The answer from the Minister of State will say everything is working well with respect to the online passport renewal service, which it is. Some of the turnaround times achieved are unbelievable. What I am looking for, however, is for the Department to keep an open mind on this issue. I will talk a bit more about the details later.</p>

          <speech by="#OssianSmyth" eId="spk_24" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Climate_and_Communications">
            <from>Deputy Ossian Smyth<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_61">The Passport Service is a unified service composed of three constituent offices located in Lower Mount Street in Dublin 2, in Balbriggan and on the South Mall in Cork. Passport applications from all citizens, whether at home or abroad, are distributed for processing across these three passport offices based on the type of application rather than on the place of residence of the applicant. The Passport Service provides a range of channels to Irish citizens wishing to apply for a passport. These include a postal application service, an online application service and an in-person, counter appointment facility in Dublin and Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> Some 90% of all passport applications, including first-time applications, are now being made online. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including a mail-in, paper-based service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use online passport services. Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online service can be accessed by all first-time applicants, including children and adults, in over 50 countries worldwide. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. Passport Online offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24-7. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to four times faster than the paper-based passport renewal application system.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> The paper-based, mail-in Passport Express service is available to citizens at almost 1,000 An Post post offices and at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and the paper-based service, very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance to apply for their passports. In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the passport offices in Dublin and Cork offer an urgent appointment service for passport renewal, with a one-day turnaround time. The Passport Service offices in Dublin and Cork have processed 5,000 urgent appointments to date in 2022. These urgent appointment applications represent less than 1% of the total number of applications received by the Passport Service since January 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> For applicants who have questions about their applications, the Passport Service customer service hub can be contacted by phone or by web chat. While I know it can be challenging to get through at busy times, the customer service hub has handled 95,000 queries to date this year. In April, customer service representatives handled an average of 1,000 queries daily. The Department has also recently updated its website, including the addition of a new Passport Service section where applicants can easily find out which documents are required for their type of application.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> Overall, the current range of service options meets the needs of passport applicants and the service improvements, including those recently introduced and those planned, allow the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance the customer experience for citizens. The Deputy has asked that an open mind be kept in this regard, and of course we will do so. </p>

            <p eId="para_66">I thank the Minister of State for his response. That last paragraph is important, because it emphasises that "the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance the customer experience for citizens". I reiterate and re-emphasise that someone in the north west will have to travel the night before an appointment and pay substantial costs for hotel accommodation. Those people will be out a lot of money in that regard, in addition to the €150 cost of the emergency passport itself. I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, this morning before I came in. I really do hope a meeting with officials and the Minister will happen quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> Turning to some general points about the current system, communication is key. We need a better early warning system. I refer to situations where people might be applying for passports for their children in January or February, perhaps. This could be similar to the case of a gentleman who rang me yesterday. He has got back passports for three of his children, but he has not got any information on whether there is going to be a problem. The flights in question are on 6 June and the due date is 8 June. That man wishes to know if there is something he can be doing in this regard. Therefore, we need better communication. We need better messaging as well. I know the Department and the Passport Office are trying to get people to access the online system rather than the paper-based one. They are trying to get away from that latter approach, but we still advertise the availability of paper-based applications as "Passport Express". Using that label straightaway gives the message that the response will happen quickly, but that might not prove to be the case. </p>
            <p eId="para_68"> We talk about the peace dividend as well. Equally, we talk about the protocol and its benefits to citizens. Talk is talk, though, and action is action. People will have to start seeing more things happening on the ground. An example would be those people who have travelled down last week, this week and every week on the A5, which is still not a dual carriageway. If we are going to be saying to the citizens of Donegal, Tyrone, Derry, or even further afield into Fermanagh and Sligo and all these surrounding counties, that we are going to provide a service equal to the service that people in Kerry, Limerick, Cork or Dublin and its wider environs get, then they must see action on this dividend. Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit a shúile agus a intinn a choinneáil oscailte.</p>

            <p eId="para_69">The Deputy made several points. He suggested there should be a better early warning system if there are errors with a passport application and the date is not going to be met. I will communicate this point to the Passport Office. Deputy McHugh also pointed out that "Passport Express" might be the wrong name if the other method is in fact the express method and that perhaps we should examine this aspect. It was, however, the faster method of securing a passport when it was introduced, but we may look at the branding of that now, given we have the online system in place. There is clearly a difference. All of us in the House are very familiar with queries about passport applications, and especially since the onset of the pandemic. We have all done a great deal of that kind of work and a lot of representing our constituents in such cases. We understand, for example, that new passport applications take much longer than renewals. People have told me they have applied to renew their passport at lunchtime and then received it the next morning. They are delighted with that outcome. On the other hand, an application for a new passport can take a long time to deliver. The Deputy is especially emphasising the need for good communication and that we ensure that when an issue does occur that we let people know about it. We have clearly got a large cohort of new passport holders from Northern Ireland. We are distributing passports to them through post offices in the North.</p>
            <p eId="para_70">We are getting many new citizens from both sides of the community, who are welcome. The system is under massive pressure because there were two years in which people did not renew their passports. That constitutes 20% of the population that did not renew their passports, meaning 1 million passports are required. That backlog is being worked through with a large number of people being hired.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">To put the figure of €144,000 in context, last year an investment fund bought in Limerick city a number of apartments for less than €168,000 each. Despite the large subsidy the Government is giving to developers, these apartments will be sold at full market price. There will be no discount or affordability built in. According to analysis by Killian Woods in the <i>Business Post</i>, only the top 14% of households in terms of income will be able to afford these prices. What does it say about the Government that it is willing to spend €450 million guaranteeing the profits of developers to provide apartments for people on the highest incomes in Ireland? Whose side is this Government on? People across the country are struggling to heat their homes, put food on the table and pay rent and bills. What planet is the Government on that it thinks it is okay to use public money to fund a €450 million giveaway to developers? The only things guaranteed under this scheme are developers' profits. It is an outrageous use of public funds to subsidise these profits. It is a gross misuse of public money which could be better spent in many ways. It is another bailout for developers. Not only does the State bail out developers when property prices collapse, it now bails out developers when apartment prices have reached all-time highs. Is there another country in the world where the government does this? The Minister in his remarks may tell us what other country does this. I look forward to hearing about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> That is a win-win for developers as, yet again, the Government gifts public funds and resources to private interests with complete disregard for public interest. It is an act of daylight robbery, taking from the people and giving to developers. How can the Government justify this? This is granting a developer's wish list. Not content with the reduction in apartment standards brought in to make construction apparently viable or with the even lower standards brought in for the build to rent schemes apparently to make apartment construction viable, the Government will give huge cash grants to make construction of apartments viable. How many times will the same lines be trotted out to justify making regressive changes that benefit developers? Each time we are told this will sort out the viability problem and each time the lobbyists come back demanding more. All the while, apartments have become less and less affordable for people. When will the Government learn?</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> I ask the Minister to answer three questions in his contribution. First, where did this idea for large subsidies for developers come from? Did the Minister dream it up or did developers and their lobbyists ask for it? We know it does not come from good practice in other countries. Other countries do not do this. This is an off-the-wall policy. When other countries invest in housing, they do so to ensure it is more affordable, not less affordable as this scheme will.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> Second, why was no economic evaluation or analysis or regulatory assessment carried out to examine what effect the scheme and subsidies would have? Has any modelling been done on how this will affect land prices? Will that modelling be published, if it has been done? What will happen to the prices of these sites once the subsidies are secured? We will see some developers flip the sites once they have secured the subsidies. The scheme allows for that because the funding is attached to the company or proposer and developers of most of these sites set up companies which they can sell on and flip. The scheme allows for the sites to be flipped and for the companies holding the subsidies to be flipped, which will inflate land prices. This will have a knock-on effect on land prices, which will have a knock-on effect on the full market prices of apartments, pushing them up. Incredibly, at the housing committee last week the Minister conceded that he would not use tax incentives in this area because they are a bad idea. I agree with him on that but to conclude that tax incentives are not a good policy solution but cash subsidies are is an incredible leap.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> Third, what level of profit for developers will be guaranteed under this scheme? Will the minimum 15% profit level that developers say is necessary for apartment construction to be viable be subsidised by the use of public funds? What controls exist in terms of the assessment process of applications to the scheme to ensure the subsidies will not be used to subsidise profits for developers? I could not find any. One of the reasons developers say a minimum 15% profit is necessary to the viability of the scheme is the high level of risk when it comes to construction and development of apartments. This scheme removes that risk for developers. In fact, if prices go down, the subsidies in the scheme will increase up to the threshold of €144,000. I do not know if the Minister has read his documents, but that is in them.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">How can the Government justify using public money to underpin this level of profits for developers while removing most of the risk?</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> We have had over the past decade a disaster in terms of housing policies. Rents have doubled, while house prices have become more unaffordable, risen 15% in the past year and are about to pass their Celtic tiger peak. Rents and house prices, especially in Dublin, are among the highest in the European Union. Homelessness has skyrocketed, increasing by 22% in the past year. Under the last few Governments, the rates of home ownership have fallen year after year.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> There is an alternative to what the Government proposes here that could see these homes built. At a fraction of the cost the State could buy out the sites and planning permissions and ensure true financing from the Housing Finance Agency so that much-needed affordable and cost rental homes are provided on these sites. That would provide the additional supply needed, create downward pressure on rents and house prices and, crucially, mean more homes available to rent and buy at prices people can afford.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> The Government could also bring in a zoning for affordable housing with price caps built into the zonings. That should be introduced and has worked effectively in cities like Vienna.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">This is one of the reasons people are able to rent a two-bedroom apartment near Vienna city centre for approximately €650 a month. This is about half of cost-rental rents here.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> Will the Minister use his time to tell us where the idea for large subsidies came from? Was it his idea or did it come from lobbying by developers? Why has no economic valuation of the scheme been carried out? By how much will it increase land prices? What knock-on effect will this have on the price of apartments? How much profit will developers make from these subsidies? Why is public money being used to guarantee these profits while reducing and eliminating much of the risk? I want the Minister to use some of his time to answer these questions. The public has a right to get information on this and get these answers. The Minister owes this to the public given that he wants to gift €450 million of their money to developers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JenniferWhitmore" eId="spk_41">
          <from>Deputy Jennifer Whitmore<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_115">The sum of €450 million is the incredibly large amount of money the Minister will hand over to developers. I can think of many better ways to spend it as I am sure can everyone in the Chamber. People are living with the incredibly difficult situation of rising inflation and the rising cost of fuel. We also have the constant backdrop of the housing crisis. This is the reality people face. As I imagine everyone in the Chamber has, I have constituents frequently contacting my office about fears of becoming homeless when their landlords decide to sell up. Some have had to move to completely different parts of the country, away from family and friends and their support networks, schools and communities. Many residents in Wicklow face the likely reality of never being able to own a home due to rising rents and house prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> The high cost of housing is having a detrimental impact on our local communities. According to the CSO, house prices have increased by 15% in the past year and will soon surpass their Celtic tiger peak. Rents have doubled in the past decade and Ireland has some of the highest rents and house prices in the European Union. The number of people who have become homeless has increased by 22% in the past year. A report published in April by the <i>Irish Independent</i> revealed that in Wicklow the average cost of renting a property is €1,635 while the monthly mortgage payment of a home is approximately €1,320. This means that over the lifetime of a 30-year mortgage people renting in Wicklow will pay €111,000 more. This is a huge concern for those renting in Wicklow who simply cannot save the money for a deposit as they continue to pay high rents. There is one property for rent in Bray at present. This is absolutely incredible. This is clearly an unsustainable situation for people renting.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> It is also increasingly clear that ordinary workers and families are being priced out of the housing market and are trapped paying exorbitant rents. They are being priced out of their communities. Even the dribble of supply coming on to the market is priced out of the reach of most ordinary workers. Yesterday two families contacted me who are both in very similar situations. Both families have young children, have only ever lived in Greystones and are renting. They have both received notices to quit from their landlords. They are doing absolutely everything right. They have contacted Threshold, the RTB and Wicklow County Council. They have been on to all of the agents. They cannot find anywhere to rent in their home town. Now they face the prospect of having to pull their children out of their schools and move to a different county. The stress being placed on families at present is incredible. The irony is that in north Wicklow thousands of houses are being built. There are strategic housing developments and large developments as far as the eye can see. None of them are affordable. Not a single one in the area is affordable. It is also ironic that the biggest opposition to strategic housing development is coming from Fine Gael public representatives. It is incredible that a party that brought this policy in is now complaining when it is in its own backyard.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> It is clear the Minister's housing policies are failing. I recognise it is not just Fianna Fáil's failure in this area. It is also a failure of Fine Gael and the Labour Party. The reason the Minister's policies are failing is that he continues to prioritise the wrong people. He continues to prioritise developers. I do not know whether this is an ideology of the Minister's or whether he has a fundamental lack of confidence in the ability of his own Government and the State to deliver housing rather than relying on the private sector to be the solution to its failures. It is not working. It is clear in every community throughout the country that it is not working. The Minister has continued to fail. Instead of acting in the interests of ordinary people who are suffering the consequences of his housing policies he is reaching across and lending a hand to developers with a €450 million gift.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> It is clear this is a record of failure. It is time for the record to change and for the Government to stand up for the interests of people and their housing needs. These are people we know and love. These are people who live in our communities. It is time for the Minister to do the right thing and look at who he prioritises and who will benefit from his housing policies because it is not our communities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#HollyCairns" eId="spk_42">
          <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_120">I thank Deputy O'Callaghan and his team for their work on this Private Members' motion. At present on <i>daft.ie</i> there are 11 properties advertised for rent in Cork South West. There are fewer than 80 homes to buy for under €250,000 between all of the major towns in west Cork. It is a beautiful part of the world with strong communities. It is the type of place people want to live in. Unfortunately, like many areas of Ireland, young families and others simply cannot afford to buy a home there. Affordable housing is rare and social housing lists are unacceptably long. It is even worse for people with a disability. The reality for so many people of my generation is that home ownership is not possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> In the past eight years house prices have doubled, growing by more than 12% in the past year alone. Rents have also doubled in a decade, while housing costs have skyrocketed, wages have flatlined and low pay is endemic. The situation is getting even worse. Many people now cannot find a place to rent, even at unimaginably expensive cost. Owning a home is just a pipe dream. This did not just happen. It is not some accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael governments over the past two decades. The actions of this Government are not only perpetuating the problem; they are making it worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> Now the Government intends to gift €450 million to developers to subsidise the construction of apartments that will be sold at full market price. This is a disgraceful abuse of taxpayers' money. It is almost unbelievable that the Minister is planning to give up to €144,000 per apartment to developers who can then sell them for up to €450,000 each. This is gifting public money to private developers. In the same week the Government is giving a €1 billion hospital to a private company, it is giving almost €500 million to developers. If it were not so serious it would be farcical. This €500 million could build affordable homes in communities throughout Ireland. It could give young families and others a chance at owning a home. It could transform the lives of thousands of people. Instead the Government is giving it to developers. How can anyone stand over this deal, which is giving subsidies of up to €144,000 per apartment to developers rather than to ordinary people? It is the clearest statement of the Government's priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> As the housing crisis gets worse and worse the Minister seems to have no idea of the realities facing families. Research has shown that last year the number of new homes available for individuals to buy fell to fewer than 6,000, which was its lowest level in years. The Parliamentary Budget Office, which is independent, recently concluded that home ownership among adults of working age between 25 and 54 in Ireland has collapsed. Instead of building homes for families, investment funds are buying up homes and building to rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> Dereliction is another major issue that disgracefully is not being addressed. There are thousands of buildings dilapidating throughout the country. Activists in Cork city have identified more than 700 derelict buildings within 2 km of Cork city centre. The same can be said for Bandon, Bantry, Skibbereen and other towns and villages throughout Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">There are large buildings in the centre of the community that could house families but they have been left idle and are falling into disrepair. The Minister visited Clonakilty, Skibbereen and other parts of west Cork this week. I hope he was shown the very many derelict buildings. There are also many formerly fine farm houses that have been left to decay and collapse. If the Government is serious about supporting rural Ireland, then dereliction needs to be tackled. So far the Government policies to address this major issue have proven to be ineffectual and inadequate. Reporting vacant sites has essentially been made the responsibility of the general public. In addition there are no vacancy reduction targets in the Government's Housing for All plan not to mention that the vacant home housing unit only has one staff member.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> It is incredibly disheartening for communities to see buildings crumble before their eyes. These are sites that would have cost a few thousand euro to do up but that work will now cost hundreds of thousands of euro due to Government inaction. It is even more frustrating and distressing for families searching for homes to witness buildings being left idle. The time to act is now. The almost €150,000 the Minister is giving to developers for each apartment would make a massive difference in converting buildings in places like Bandon and Kinsale into homes or save farmhouses across rural Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_163"> I thank Deputy O'Callaghan and his colleagues from the Social Democrats for tabling this motion. I wish to address a number of the points that have been raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> As recognised in our housing plan, the Housing for All strategy, and as we all know, there is a crisis that affects ordinary working people who aspire to the security of home ownership, which demands a response from Government at an unprecedented scale and means doing things. Ireland is experiencing an acute gap between housing supply and demand, which is exacerbated by the economic effects of Covid-19 and global supply change disruption and which requires, in line with Housing for All's four pathways, short, medium and longer term State interventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Increased supply of social, affordable and, indeed, market supplied housing is key to providing a solution to Ireland's housing crisis. Meeting strong demand for urban living with people wanting to live close to work and urban amenities requires action to ensure we have developments at scale within our cities, particularly those that are close to transport connections and existing infrastructure and services so that is compact urban growth. There is a dearth of supply of apartments to buy in our core urban areas but there is a large number of planning permissions already granted that could meet much of this supply if activated.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> Housing for All will deliver 300,000 new homes by the end of 2030. It will deliver 90,000 social homes, which will be new builds, and it will deliver 9,000 this year, which is the single biggest number of social homes delivered in any year in the history of the State. That is a fact. It will deliver at least 36,000 affordable homes and at least 18,000 cost-rental homes. That represents record levels of State investment in housing with more than €4 billion per annum. The supply pipeline is strong, thankfully, and nearly 5,700 new homes have been delivered in quarter 1 of this year, which is the most in any first quarter since this Central Statistics Office, CSO, statistic began back in 2011. There have been more than 22,000 home completions in the last four quarters. Nearly 35,000 new homes were commenced in the 12 months to March 2022. Again, that is the highest 12-month rolling total since these figures were collated. More than 32,700 first-time buyers have been supported into home ownership by the help-to-buy scheme since 2017, which we have continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> The Government is committed to supporting home ownership through a range of targeted measures, including the delivery of housing in partnership with local authorities, which we are doing and doing this year, the Land Development Agency, which we are doing, approved housing bodies and, indeed, private industry. The Government is committed to achieving more compact urban growth and vibrant liveable cities with a greater range of options for both owner-occupiers and renters in cities of all income levels, which as a first step requires that stalled apartment developments with planning permission are put in place and are occupied.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> The Land Development Agency plans to deliver affordable homes with construction to begin this year on more than 800 new homes. Planning permissions have been recently lodged in the last few weeks for a further 2,300 homes on State land. There are proposals under Project Tosaigh, which concerns unactivated planning permissions and partnering within the sector, to deliver 5,000 new affordable and social homes by 2026 through engagement with the sector to unlock land with full permission that is not being developed due to financing.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> It is estimated that there are 70,000 uncommenced planning permissions in the five main cities of Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. The figure for unactivated permissions in Dublin alone is approximately 40,000, which is about four years of housing supply in this capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> The Croí Cónaithe cities scheme will help to activate the build-to-sell portion of these figures. The Croí Cónaithe cities scheme will deliver up to 5,000 apartments by 2026 for people to buy. It will help increase the supply of new apartments in these cities by activating the construction of apartments that already have planning permission. The scheme will support the construction of apartment schemes where there is a proven viability gap between the cost of constructing an apartment and the apartment's open market value if that market value is lower than the cost of construction. The planned scheme is a short to medium-term measure. It is time bound and is aimed at increasing the supply of apartments for home owners. It will increase the choice of homes available to buy and will ultimately free up supply in the private rental market.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> I want to be very clear on this point. The benefit of the proposed support goes to the owner-occupier, the purchaser, who is unable to buy an apartment in a core urban location which would not otherwise have been built at a price below the development cost. That is a fact. I will give Deputies a particular example. Where an apartment costs €350,000 to develop but the market rate is €250,000, then the person buying it will pay €250,000. Better still, people can use the help-to-buy grant to become eligible for the deposit. Should they wish they can use the Government's soon to be launched first-home shared equity scheme, which again the Deputies opposed. That is fine and is their right. The Deputies who have called for the scheme to be scrapped obviously do not want individuals living in city centres and they do not want compact urban growth or 15-minute cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Through a range of measures the Government is incentivising the supply of different tenures - social, affordable, private rental and private ownership. We are investing in new build social schemes like never before, delivering affordable housing to buy and rent and introducing measures to incentivise the building of homes for owner-occupiers. The support payable per apartment will be the viability gap calculated for each apartment. We have detailed that very clearly and that is exactly what will happen. It is important to emphasise that it is anticipated that targeted supports will differ across a range of different apartment types. For one-bedroom apartments, where it has been proven that there is a viability gap, then the figure is between €25,000 and €60,000. It will be between €60,000 and €85,000 for two-bedroom apartments and up to €120,000 for two to three-bedroom apartments. Where does that support go? It goes to the purchaser, the owner-occupier with exacting conditions and proposals through expressions of interest on an open-book basis. It is as simple as that. This is a quick and efficient way of activating dormant permissions within cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> I thank the Deputies for tabling the motion because it allows me the opportunity to outline the Government's position. The Social Democrats voted against all Government legislation, so I know very clearly what they are against but I have very little clue what they support. They are against build-to-rent and now, apparently, they are against build-to-buy. They are against the help-to-buy scheme, which has supported 30,000 home owners to get their deposit together to purchase home. This is the same help-to-buy scheme that would be available along with this measure. That means the people who are stuck in the very rental trap that we are talking about or living at home with their parents will be able to own their home at an affordable rate. They are also against the first-home shared equity scheme, which can be used alongside this initiative or for all new builds, and not just by first-time buyers but for those on the Fresh Start principle. They are opposed to that too. It is scheme that will launch on 1 July. It is a scheme that will help people bridge the gap between the finance they have and the finance they need by the State stepping in and taking that equity. It is not a second mortgage as some of them claimed when the scheme was launched. They continuously, and rightly so, call for State lands to be used to build homes but are against the Land Development Agency. The agency was set up and we have legislated for and funded it specifically for that purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">The Deputies say they want homes built on State lands but they vote against the legislation. Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and his party are against home ownership, affordable and cost rental. As he is aware, his colleague voted against 1,200 new homes in Ballymastone in Donabate, of which 253 would have been affordable and 253 social. That was opposed by the Social Democrats and that is fine. The record shows what the Social Democrats did. Just last week, Deputy Shortall, the co-leader of the Social Democrats, posted online her regret at an application for 99 apartments in her constituency. That is awful, is it not - that we are building new apartments? She posted her regret that that is happening. Is the Social Democrats really against home ownership? It appears that it is. The Government is already ensuring that we can activate uncommenced planning permissions. The only comment I have seen from the Social Democrats is in a paper where it mentions the "use it or lose it" provision which the Government is doing already. We want to pull all levers available to provide homes for people, and that includes short-, medium- and longer-term measures while we are delivering the supply that is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> I support home ownership and social housing. I do not vote against it or the legislation that is brought forward in the House. I do not vote against the budgets the Government put in place to deliver housing at a scale that has never been seen before. We are proposing it and working it through and we are seeing that supply being activated during a very difficult time for people. I know what the Social Democrats is against. The motion refers to a gift. It is nothing like a gift; it is assistance and support to the homeowner and purchaser. Let us be honest with people in that regard. It is clear from the measures the Social Democrats has taken - opposing the Affordable Housing Act, the Land Development Agency Act and any new initiative proposed by the Government - that it does not want to see progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">The question I ask is what this scheme says to generation rent, the generation of young people who are completely priced out of the housing market. They are watching the Government hand over €450 million to private developers. What hope do they have of ever owning their own home when, in many cases, 60% of their income goes on rent? How could they possibly save for a mortgage? They are being squeezed out of the market in a time of rising living costs. The average citizen is struggling with energy costs. The response of the Government is to give €200 to help with electricity or other energy bills. When the private developers run into a cost-of-living crisis, however, they are given €144,000 per apartment.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> The Minister talked about supply. What kind of supply? It is supply that people cannot afford, supply that traps them permanently into renting when, in fact, they want a choice that gives them longer-term sustainability.</p>

          <p eId="para_185"> I ask the Minister to answer the questions put to him by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan. From where did this idea come? What contact did the Minister have?

The Minister is using the same reference points to create another housing environment that is completely unsustainable. The public does not have confidence in the Minister. That was shown in the poll published earlier in the week. He would know the public does not have confidence in him if he listened to some of the radio programmes on which people who are likely to end up homeless are talking about their lived experience of being terrified and thinking this should not happen to them. I have recognised that and been talking about this since 2014 when the like of the housing assistance payment, HAP, was brought in. I said that if it was not accompanied by large-scale direct build, it would be a bonanza for landlords. That is exactly what has happened. Close to €1 billion a year is being used for things like the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, HAP and rent supplement.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">Having listened to his response to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, I am still at a loss as to why he intends to give up to €144,000 per apartment to developers so they may do the job that they and, indeed, the Government believe they are capable of doing. Through the Chair, I will once again ask who initiated the scheme. Who was around the table when the Government came up with this scheme? The Minister should feel free to interrupt me now. He has rolled his eyes and jumped in at various points. Who helped him to initiate the scheme? Are any independent commentators advocating for it? Deputy Cian O'Callaghan asked several questions. I will repeat them and allow time for the Minister to answer them, if he wishes to do so. As the Minister hands out €450 million worth of State assets, what independent analysis was carried out on this policy? He should feel free to interrupt me.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> He asked about what the Social Democrats stands for. We stand for evidence-based policies. That is why we are asking for an independent analysis. Why are we asking the Minister for it? Because we are conscious of our history. We are conscious of the Galway tent. When one becomes conscious of the scandals of one's nation's history, one starts to see them replicated in different ways. When we hear of €450 million going to developers, we have every reason to ask why that is happening and who benefits - <i>cui bono</i> -and we make no apologies for doing so. The Minister should again feel free to interrupt.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Are there any international examples to which he can point where the affordability of housing increased as a result of the state gifting huge sums of money to private developers without securing additional benefit for those seeking a home? Are there any benefits to Irish taxpayers in general, who are inevitably funding this enormous transfer of wealth? Why are there no affordability criteria locked into this massive subsidy?</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> I will accept absolutely no indignation from the Government when it comes to whom it deems worthy of State funding. Many Members throughout the Chamber act in different roles as spokespersons. Last night in this Chamber, I asked the Minister for Social Protection whether an artist with a disability, for example, who receives the minimum basic income should keep his or her blind pension or disability allowance. I was scoffed at and told that, of course, the Government has to scrutinise every cent in State subsidy. Why not apply the exact same standard in the context of this €450 million that is being gifted to developers just for doing their jobs and building apartments?</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> I am conscious this is the third time in seven years we have been told apartment buildings are so unviable for developers that the State must simply bend to their whim and on each occasion it has contributed to the worsening of our housing crisis and to the benefit of those who seek only to profit from it. In 2015, a former Minister with responsibility for housing and a former Labour Party Leader, Deputy Kelly, slashed Department guidelines, including the minimum size of apartments, because he said it would make them more affordable and would boost supply. It did not. In 2018, a former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, slashed guidelines for build-to-rent developments, further reducing apartment sizes and eliminating the need for apartment mix and outside space because he said it would make them more affordable. It did not. When one becomes conscious of one's State's history, one starts to see it replicated in different ways. It is clear what the Social Democrats stand for in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> My colleague, Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, asked which side is the Minister on? It is a very reasonable question. We are ploughing through a scenario where €450 million of State assets will be transferred to developers. The Minister can feel free to tell me how that is not the case. At different times in this Chamber, as we discussed the housing crisis and solutions to it, we have been told of things we simply cannot do. The Minister told us a record number of commencements are beginning to happen. I want to believe him. I want to take what he said at face value. However, while that is happening, it will take a number of years to introduce. Therefore, why can we not introduce a rent freeze? That is what people are calling for. We have been told that simply cannot happen. Yet the Government can give €450 million to developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> Over the weekend we were told the long sought-after vacant home tax simply may no longer come to fruition. We have had delay after delay and prevarication. It will simply not happen and that will be to the advantage of those who have benefited from the housing crisis. We have been asked to legislate to deal with short-term lets. We are told that simply cannot happen despite the fact it is clearly increasing the cost of rent throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Deputy Cairns referenced the level of dereliction in her constituency. Many of us see such dereliction in our constituencies throughout the country. Funding of €450 million would go a very long way towards solving that problem but the Government intends to transfer it to developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> I am at a loss as to why this Government, of which Fianna Fáil is a member, continues to want to give the scorpion a lift on its back. Once one become conscious of one's nation’s failures, one starts to see them replicated in different ways. That is all we can see happening from the introduction of this measure. The Social Democrats stand for evidence based policy that will alleviate this crisis. What does the Minister stand for?</p>

          <p eId="para_207">I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and his colleagues in the Social Democrats for tabling this important motion, which Sinn Féin enthusiastically supports. In my six short years in the Dáil, Croí Cónaithe cities is the craziest housing scheme any Minister with responsibility for housing has brought before us. It is nothing short of a pro-developer subsidy. There is no price discount on unaffordable market rates. There is no affordability dividend for anyone. To date, the Minister and the Department have been silent on the fact that the vast majority of apartment planning permissions are for build-to-rent, which strictly speaking should not be eligible under this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> We know the vast majority of this Minister’s housing plan is a rehash of the failed Rebuilding Ireland policies of former Ministers with responsibility for housing, Eoghan Murphy and Deputy Coveney, but the only thing the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, has brought to the table is a return to the bad old days of Fianna Fáil Celtic tiger hubris. The Minister, in his remarks, said that tackling the housing crisis means doing things. That is not correct. It is about doing the right things and not doing things that make the housing crisis worse, something he now has a habit of doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> With respect to the origins of this scheme, my understanding is its origins are within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and a concern among some officials that the gap between affordability and viability was running contrary to the national planning framework and compact growth, exactly as the Minister outlined. We know from the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland that the cheapest possible all-in development cost of apartments is €400,000 plus. That means people cannot buy apartments. They cannot be built without forward purchasing agreements, which is why we have the issue of cuckoo funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> The original idea, as I understand it, was that where apartments would be delivered for €400,000, the developer would get a subsidy of about €80,000 and the apartment would be sold for €320,000. While that scheme, in itself, was not a great idea it has been surpassed by something much worse. I understand there was some concern as to whether the subsidy would be equity, a subsidy or a grant but rather than getting that proposition, the Minister has come back with something even worse. We are now told that the problem is not viability versus affordability but it is viability versus the market price. </p>
          <p eId="para_211"> I want to read a short excerpt from a very good article by Killian Woods in the <i>Business Post</i> at the weekend because it stands in stark contrast to the figures the Minister quoted here today. Killian Woods's information is based on information from the Minister's Department. The article states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_212">An expression-of-interest document being circulated to the development industry by the Housing Agency, a copy of which has been obtained by <i>Business Post</i>, shows it is anticipated that the open market value of a two-bed apartment delivered through the scheme will be €390,000. A three-bed apartment is anticipated to have an open market value of at least €450,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The article then goes on to detail the various subsidies involved. When the Minister says he believes in homeownership, what is patently clear from this scheme is he only believes in homeownership for the very wealthy, for 14% of households. Is he seriously saying it is now Government policy that the only people who should be allowed live in Dublin city and own their own apartments are those earning €100,000 a year or more?</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> This is a chronic waste of taxpayers' money. At best, it will lock in unaffordable prices. At worst, it will drive prices up even further. The scheme should be scrapped. There is no justification for taking €450 million and investing it in a way that does not deliver either a discount on market price or genuine affordability. The amount of money that has been quoted in newspapers, with sources from the Minister and the Housing Agency, I am not sure what it is for this scheme over the next number of years, pales into insignificance compared to the amount of money for the affordable housing fund. This year, for example, the affordable housing fund has €60 million. We do not know what the Minister will increase it to next year but, on the basis of the targets, it will not go much above that. Therefore, we have a situation where the only mechanism this Government has designed to deliver affordable homes for people to purchase, and he is not even using that scheme correctly, for example, by delivering homes for €410,000 in O'Devaney Gardens, but even the affordable housing fund, which can deliver genuinely affordable homes if it is used properly, will not get a fraction of the money he is giving to this pro-developer scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> I will reiterate Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's comments and those of his colleagues. A number of very simple questions were put to the Minister. I know the Minister will probably not remain for the debate and he will be substituted by his colleague but those questions should be answered and answered in writing. I presume Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has already submitted parliamentary questions in the absence of the Minister giving any straight answers here. I think the rest of us will do so but we need straight answers. For example, if there is an expression-of -interest document being circulated by the Housing Agency, the Minister should publish it. Let us see the information he is giving to developers. </p>
          <p eId="para_216"> I will conclude by saying this. The Minister comes in here week after week. He dismisses the legitimate concerns of the Opposition. He defends the indefensible while all around him things are getting worse - rents, house prices and homelessness. As we fast approach his being two years in office, it is quite clear he is an even worse housing Minister, in terms of results, than Eoghan Murphy and Deputy Coveney or, indeed, Deputy Kelly, before him.</p>

          <p eId="para_218">I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and the Social Democrats for bringing forward this motion. What is shows, and having listened to the Minister, is how out of the touch he is with ordinary people. When the Opposition comes together to put forward proposals and to highlight problems with the Government's strategy on solving the housing crisis, we know the attitude he adopts to the Opposition. The way the Minister criticised Deputy Cian O'Callaghan earlier is like the way he criticises Deputy Ó Broin every week. The Minister's only answer is to criticise other people and parties who have put forward genuine solutions. That is typical Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael policy. Anyone who might watch the proceedings of this discussion or read about it would be of the view that this Government and the Green Party, which is a member of it, should be ashamed of their lives to give €450 million to the developers. We know Fianna Fáil is pro-developer, we know Fine Gael is pro-development but where is the Green Party, which said it would stand up for ordinary people and ordinary families? If we want to spend €450 million, I will tell the Minister how we should spend it.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">We have 90,000 vacant houses right now that with this investment we could turn into homes to put families into in the short term. That is what we could do. Instead, we are in the middle of the worst housing crisis ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> I have a clinic every Monday and Friday. On Monday alone, five families came in to me who will have to be out of their homes by September. The Minister is giving €450 million to developers. Is the Government so out of touch with reality? People cannot afford to rent and even if they could afford to rent, they cannot find properties to rent. They cannot find properties to buy and there is no social housing there.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> I appeal to the Green Party, which has a lot going on this week. They should stand up. If there is one issue they should stand up on today ,it is the housing crisis. They are letting Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael get away with what they have got way with for 100 years, that is, looking after their buddies, looking after developers and looking after the well-to-do while ordinary people are suffering and they have never suffered. The housing crisis has never been as bad as it is today.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">I might manage to give a minute to my colleague, Deputy Daly.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> I am struck by the sums of money we are talking about. We have so many debates in this House where we talk about there not being money for this and that, and €450 million has been found for this scheme. Now I like the idea of breathing life into our cities and ensuring that our city centre cores are strong and that we have affordable apartments, but this is not the way to do it. There is not even a condition on affordability. When we are handing €450 million over to developers, there is nothing to say that it will not simply be absorbed by them. We will not see a benefit. We will not see apartments or housing become more affordable.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> By every metric, as has been already said, the housing crisis is getting worse when one looks at rents, when you look at house prices and when you look at the number of people finding themselves in homeless situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> Our clinics are inundated, as, I am sure, are the Minister's, with people who are getting notices to quit who have nowhere to go but also with people who do not qualify for social housing lists, who have been knocked off social housing lists because of the income thresholds and who have no hope of getting a commercial mortgage. The advice that we can give them is limited because the schemes that are available are limited and this will not help them.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> This will not change how affordable apartments are. There are apartments right now in Cork, two-bedroom new builds, for half a million euro and three-bedroom ones for €695,000. In many respects, that is as bad as Dublin. That is the situation that we are facing in Cork. They are unaffordable and absolutely out of reach for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> This is not the way to go. I urge the Minister to put that €450 million into vacant homes and into building affordable houses on public land and making sure that they are actually at affordable prices.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">I thank the Social Democrats.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> I was struck this week by information on Twitter, which showcased the high ratio of Airbnb vacancies as against advertised rental vacancies. One of the users mapped these figures and showed that County Kerry has the highest ratio in the entire country, with 1,959 vacancies on Airbnb yet only 34 advertisements on Daft.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> My colleagues have spoken about the measures required to move suitable properties and I understand there are planning enforcements happening. My party's charge on non-primary residents can also play a role, if it is to be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> In relation to the €450 million, there are things that could be done to divert land, labour and capital. In the past, it has been diverted away from proper housing. We see all the craftspeople, builders and contractors leaving Kerry every day. They should be used to deal with the housing crisis, including, for example, the 15-year waiting lists in Kerry, particularly the newer houses that are needed west of Dingle in the Gaeltacht.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Browne<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_234">I also thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and the Social Democrats for bringing the motion before the House. It gives us the opportunity to speak for the thousands of families that the failed policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael over the years have locked out of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> Tipperary has witnessed a house price increase of 14.3% year on year, according to the latest <i>daft.ie</i> report, but it does not stop there. If a family looks to get out of the stranglehold of the rental market, the cost of a three-bedroom semi-detached house has increased by a staggering 17.7% in the past year, yet the very same county was excluded from the Government's list of 18 local authorities identified for their affordable housing programme up to 2026. Even if Tipperary was in the plan, it would have to share a grand total of €60 million with the other counties while the Minister puts €450 million in the pockets of developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> Unaffordable housing impacts both the purchase market and the rental market. It keeps housing lists long and prolongs the uncertainty many families deal with daily.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> Where are we at in Tipperary? It is becoming increasingly common in Tipperary to meet people who have no choice but to seek emergency accommodation from the local authority but it is also becoming increasingly common to hear the local authority say it is having difficulty in getting emergency accommodation for those families. They are the people who the Government is leaving without any protection. They are the families sleeping in cars, on sofas or packed into box rooms while the Minister puts money into the pockets of developers who seek to maximise their returns.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> This scheme subsidies private developers up to €144,000 for apartments outside of Dublin to give them a profit margin, yet it does absolutely nothing for the people who are locked out of the market. This forces the price upwards and continues the cycle of unaffordable housing and the lack of supply and yet the Government guarantees profits for developers while turning the screw further on those it has put on the outside and who are forced to look in, helpless.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> Last week, Sinn Féin called on the Government to direct the funding to this scheme and the shared equity scheme into the delivery of an average of least 4,000 genuinely affordable homes to buy each year. We would ensure that local authorities and approved housing bodies are adequately resourced to deliver affordable homes to rent and buy. That is the future, not the politics and actions of the Government, which increase housing costs and limit supply.</p>

        <speech by="#ImeldaMunster" eId="spk_74">
          <from>Deputy Imelda Munster<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_240">I welcome the opportunity to speak against this ridiculous proposal from Government, namely, the gifting of €450 million to developers. It is the most Celtic tiger, Fianna Fáil-type of insanity that I have seen since they destroyed the economy in 2007 and 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> House prices are spiralling. They have increased by 15% in the past year. Rents have doubled in the past ten years. We have among the highest rents and house prices in the EU and Fianna Fáil's solution is to throw hundreds of millions of euro at developers. It is like <i>déjà vu</i>. It is genuinely unbelievable.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> This scheme will gift €450 million to developers to subsidise the construction of apartments that will then be sold at market price. The Government is seriously going to do this. We now know that this will translate into up to €120,000 per unit in Dublin and up to €144,000 per unit outside of Dublin. The <i>Business Post</i> reported on Sunday last that the open market value of a two-bedroom apartment under the scheme will be €390,000 and a three-bedroom apartment is expected to be at least €450,000. It is absolute madness.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> This is public money being spend seemingly without any thought, any cost-benefit analysis or any cost evaluation. How is it value for money for the taxpayer? How is it value for money for people who want to own their home? There is no affordability here.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> This fund will inflate costs. It will make housing less affordable. It is the exact same as previous hare-brained schemes from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, such as the help to buy and the shared equity schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> The Minister released his affordable housing targets for 2022 to 2026 and the figures were shocking in their lack of ambition. In County Louth, the target is 226, that is, 45 affordable houses on average a year. It outlines in black and white the Government's attitude towards affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> The most galling part of all of this is that the money being used in this scheme to line the pockets of developers could actually be put to good use. It could be used to provide housing that will address the unaffordable issue rather than making it worse. Sinn Féin's motion on Wednesday last called on the Government to use the funding for this scheme and the shared equity scheme to deliver an average of at lease 4,000 genuinely affordable homes each year. The affordable housing targets need to be revised as a matter of urgency. Funding needs to be redirected to capital investment in affordable housing for purchase, all schemes that push up the cost of housing need to be scrapped and, above all, affordable needs to be affordable.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_247">I thank the Social Democrats for bringing this forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I often get up here and say that I will not repeat what has already been said and then I repeat exactly what was said, but in this case it is impossible not to because it takes about 30 seconds to point out that the Government will hand €450 million to developers. There is no affordability win. All we are doing is failing to use that money to deliver housing for people. It is an abject, absolute failure. It does not make any sense whatsoever. We have already heard about two-bedroom apartments potentially costing €390,000 and a three-bedroom apartment costing €450,000. It is hard to make sense of these figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> Deputy Munster talked about the affordable housing targets and Louth's derisory figure of 226. It is straightforward to say that this will not cut the mustard. We all have people coming into our constituency offices, I am about to enter into my single transferable speech on housing, with whom we talk about the amount of money they are paying in rent. In some cases, it is €1,400 or €1,600 and more, which they cannot afford. I do not know how they get the money together in any way, shape or form.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> Deputy Ó Laoghaire has spoken many times, as I have, about the income thresholds for getting on the housing list and the means by which they are assessed over the entire year, which throws up multiple anomalies. People have lost out on housing having been on housing lists for eight or nine years plus. This is absolutely ridiculous and scandalous. They subsequently apply, get back on to the housing list, and are in receipt of HAP, once again. It is just an abject failure. I have raised it a number of times in the Chamber the fact that people in receipt of HAP have been told that there are no payment plans. That even includes people who end up in hospital or experience unforeseen circumstances. What are we going to do? We will add them to the homeless list.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> We have a plan that is not a plan in respect of delivery across the board. This certainly is not any sort of plan that will deliver for people. We need at least 4,000 affordable houses a year. Beyond that, we must deliver affordable cost rental and affordable mortgages but we really must deliver social housing. We have seen the failures of government after government. This is certainly not going to make anything better. We need to go back to the planning table. It is time to listen to the Opposition.</p>

          <from>Deputy Duncan Smith<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_252">In response to Deputy Ó Murchú, that will not happen. There has been no listening to the Opposition on this or any other issue. I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for yet another very good motion on housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> It is incredible what the Government is doing here. Last year, we interrogated and tried to highlight as best we possibly could the problems with the shared equity scheme and how it would inflate prices. We cited the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and international practice of how this was a poor scheme. We highlighted the problems with the help-to-buy scheme and how that inflated prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> It is almost as if the Government has decided it will do something that is so big, grand, brazen and fantastical, in terms of transferring taxpayers' money directly to developers, that the media, the Opposition and the public will not latch on to it. That is what I believe is being done. This is the most quintessential Fianna Fáil policy we have seen since the halcyon days of the so-called Celtic tiger Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> I speak on this debate at a time when my advice clinics in Fingal are crippled with people in housing distress. I have been doing advice clinics for eight years and they have been about housing, housing, housing. During Covid, given the ban on evictions, there was a slight pause in the intensity of the housing representations. That is now gone and people are attending in huge numbers, in massive distress. On a glorious Saturday morning in Swords, with the sound of a wedding in the church next to me, I had a man come to my clinic on behalf of his family who was in floods of tears and facing eviction. It was one of the most heartbreaking juxtaposition of what was happening outside compared with what was happening in the Brackenstown adult scene of education, BASE, community centre in Swords. This is happening in all our clinics. I am disappointed that the Minister is not here because it happened in his constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> The Government must know that this measure will not solve the housing crisis. It will not do anything for cost rental. It will not do anything to increase affordable or local authority supply. This measure will only increase the bank balances and income streams of the developers, who are back where they were in the 1990s and early 2000s. They are in total control of the housing market and supply. They are calling the shots. It is not new developers. It is the same developers in the same areas on the same plots of land that were under the microscope for years and they are now being activated through the last of the strategic housing developments, SHDs, and future planning permissions. All the tracks are being put in place to ensure that the very elite will have good times ahead while the majority of people in this country, be they young or old, families, divorced or separated, people with disabilities - the list goes on - face numerous obstacles, many of which are insurmountable, to get secure housing, be it through local authorities, cost rental or via their own purchase.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> From what has been reported in the media, it is not clear whether there is a clawback mechanism built into these new grants for developers. It is clearly vital to ensure that public money is spent wisely and is not simply bumping up developers' profits. The fact that there is no clarity on this tell us that there is none, that this is not being spent wisely, and that this could be the most unwise spending of money we have seen by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> We have mentioned the shared equity scheme and the help-to-buy scheme, which seem to be the appetiser to this absolute monstrosity being put forward by the Government. Any grant given to anyone to build any type of home should be given on the condition that those homes would be truly affordable to the average worker, people with disabilities, and young, old or separated people, as well as those on the edge.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> It was said that there have been numerous failures. I must come back to a number of points raised in the debate earlier. Deputy Gannon mentioned Deputy Kelly when he was Minister, in the context of apartment sizes. Deputy Gannon then said that we need to call for rent freezer, we know they can be done. We know they can be done because Deputy Kelly, in his 19 months as a Minister, having taken over from three years of absolute inactivity by Phil Hogan on housing, delivered two rent freezes. Deputy Ó Broin mentioned Deputy Kelly as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> During my time on the council, when Deputy Kelly became Minister, we actually saw Part 8 developments come through. We saw direct local authority builds in councils that were able to do them and had resources, such as Fingal. Racecourse Common in Lusk came through, as did Darcystown, Balrothery; Rolestown and Holymount, Swords; Pinewood Green in Balbriggan; and the Grange in Ballyboughal. These were 2015 Part 8 developments. They were not targets. They were not commencement notices or planning permissions. These are real homes delivered by a local authority. It took them a while to deliver them but they were commenced under Labour leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> When the Labour Party left office and when Eoghan Murphy took over, there was a shift in policy. It was a case of going with HAP; which would be the be-all and end-all. What should have been a transitional payment from the rent allowance poverty trap scandal towards a wider scheme of public delivery of housing, between 2016 and 2020, became the squandered years of public housing delivery due to the policy shift towards HAP. Now what do we have? We have a relatively stable economy that is now being geared in a high-powered overdrive fashion back towards developers. We are back to square one. It is even worse. It has never been this bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">We have never had so many people excluded from housing. We have never had so many people who are about to be evicted, who are in homelessness or who are unable to afford to buy or rent. All we have is spin and a housing market that is solely reliant on developers. That is the bottom line. Our local authorities that were hollowed out in the 1990s and the early 2000s remain hollowed out. They do not have the resources. If we go into any local authority and try to do a head count of people who are able to deliver housing, they are not there, because successive Governments and Ministers have not done that. </p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_263">I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for putting forward the motion. One cannot be too strong in condemning what is an absolutely insane scheme from this Government. It is a demonstration that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and sadly, the Green Party, have reverted to type. They have returned to the utterly disastrous developer-led policies which led to the crash in 2008 that almost destroyed our economy and inflicted a decade of suffering on working people. The worst legacy of that is the ongoing housing crisis that we now face. The vast majority of working people cannot afford to put a roof over their head. I am sorry that the Minister has gone. It is appropriate that the Minister of State is here, because nowhere is the disastrous failure of the Government's policy more evident than in our constituency of Dún Laoghaire, where average house prices are now over €600,000 and average rents are the highest in the country, at well over €2,200 a month. The vast majority of working people cannot afford to put a roof over their head, and more and more people who are working, paying tax and getting up in the morning are actually being driven into homeless accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> The Government thinks the answer to that level of unaffordability and that crisis is to give €450 million more to private developers to give them a subsidy of up to €144,000 per apartment to deliver two- and three-bedroom housing units that will cost €390,000 and €450,000 respectively. That is what the Government's answer is. Are the Members of the Government off their rockers? I can see why the developers want it. Some €450 million of public money is being given to developers to deliver housing that people will need an income in excess of around €120,000 a year to be able to afford, or the units will be bought by investors - who else could afford them - to rent at rents that nobody can afford.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> I do not know if the Minister of State is aware of the scale of individual human misery that is resulting from this insane sort of policy. Of course, this is just the latest and most brazen example of such failed policies. We can add to that the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding of €200 million that was given to developers for infrastructure and the old Part V affordable housing scheme that the Greens and Fianna Fáil dreamed up, which provided so-called affordable housing. That led huge numbers of people into negative equity and led to them losing their homes after the crash in 2008. The Government is at it again, letting the developers dictate policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> I ask the Minister of State what this means for people in our area. I will tell him what it means. Those whose income is below €35,000 net are entitled to go on to the social housing list, which is 20 years long in our area. That means that people cannot get a social house. They are told to go and get HAP. They are told to go on <i>Daft.ie</i> by the people in the council and look for an apartment or house within the HAP limits. For those facing homelessness, the rental limit is €1,950 a month. There is not a single house available in the Dún Laoghaire constituency within that limit. In fact, people are looking for one-bed accommodation at €1,950. The HAP limit for one-bed accommodation is €990 per month. Imagine the despair and hopelessness when those are the options. People are goosed if their income is below €35,000 net. It is as bad for those whose income is over €35,000 net. For example, I am dealing with the case of a woman who is €38 per week over the income threshold. She has been in homeless accommodation with her now 11-year-old child for three and a half years. Her child is getting counselling because of the mental impact of being in one room with his mother for three and a half years, who, by the way, ironically, is working for Tusla, looking after vulnerable children. She is working for the State, looking after vulnerable children, has been in homeless accommodation for three and a half years and has just been knocked off the housing list. What can she get a mortgage for on an income of just over €35,000? She could get a mortgage of around €127,000, when average house prices are around €600,000. She is goosed. She is also being threatened with eviction from homeless accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> I know of another family of six who are in Blackrock. There are two parents, one of whom is working, and four children, who are all at college. The family is just about to be evicted from homeless accommodation because they have gone over the income limit. Can the Minister of State see the madness of this? The family has no chance of paying €350,000, €390,000 or €450,000 for a home. If they were to rent at the average rents in our area of €2,200 or more, that would account for two thirds of all of their income. They simply cannot do it. They are absolutely goosed, but the Government thinks it is okay to carry on with this madness. Up in Cherrywood, in the biggest residential development in the entire State, there are 8,000 housing units which, if they were affordable, would probably go a long a way to solving the housing crisis. Although I agree with the points they have made, I must say to our Labour colleagues that part of the responsibility lies at their door. I recall that when the decisions were being made to sell off what was NAMA land to private developers, I, Deputy Paul Murphy and others railed against it. The consequences are that we are only going to get 300 affordable houses out of 8,000 on what was previously public land. We are being told that affordability will be €37,000 less than the market price, when the developers are saying that they probably will not be able to sell the houses for anything less than €450,000. In other words, the houses will not be affordable for 95% of workers. We still have no idea what the affordable housing in Shanganagh is actually going to cost. When is the Government going to stop with this madness? When is the State going to directly build public and affordable housing on its on land at prices that are really affordable for ordinary working people?</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_268">First, I think we have to stand back from what has been said here. We have to stop blaming politicians and past decisions that were made. The biggest problem we have now is that we are giving money to developers. We should not be giving money to developers. Housing should not be developer-led; it should be development-led. If the €450 million in funding was made available in my constituency in County Galway, it would build the infrastructure for the wastewater treatment plants that we need in our towns and villages in order to build houses. It would help with taking over and putting into public charge the private wastewater treatment plants that are littered across this country. There is nobody maintaining them. Residents in the housing estates are paying local property tax and feel they should not have to contribute towards the expensive maintenance of these wastewater treatment plants.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">What is also happening is that more houses cannot be put on to these treatment plants' systems. In effect, we have frozen out the planning process for extensions or infill to existing private developments. We have also frozen out any development in any village or town where we do not have a municipal wastewater treatment plant.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> We have growth centres around Galway city which would act as a place for people to live at an affordable price, rather than having to live in the city. They are finding that we cannot build houses. The council will be coming up with a plan to build houses in clusters in which we put five houses with individual sceptic tanks in towns and villages. I do not know where the environment will match up with that. We have much to do. We should be targeting towns' and villages' infrastructure and making sure that the wastewater treatment plants are in place. We should also make sure that the houses which are being built and which are deemed to be affordable are built for the people. The people should benefit from those houses being affordable.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> Deputies refer to the problems they have in their constituencies. I have people who are living in caravans and mobile homes outside their parents' houses because they cannot rent, buy or build a house. Planning has frozen them out, and houses are not available. We have a perfect storm. We need to decide that this is a housing crisis and an emergency. We need to make sure that we put plans in place to deal with that emergency. We need to look seriously at derelict and vacant properties throughout the country. We should make them affordable for first-time buyers. We should make them affordable for people who need housing. A woman contacted me this morning. She is living with her parents. She was born in 1974, which would make her between 45 and 50 years old, and has two children. She is working but cannot rent a house because she cannot get one to rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> The HAP scheme is not working. Unintended landlords are now pulling out of the HAP system because they are being burdened with too many rules and regulations and have no protections. In the event that a tenant refuses to pay his or her contribution to the HAP, the landlord does not get paid at all. That needs to be looked at. What are we doing to encourage people to make their houses available to people who are on the social housing list? There is a considerable amount of work to be done. This is an emergency. Let us get into dealing with it in depth in order that we might make some progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">Fianna Fáil offers hundreds of millions of euros to big property developers. That sentence could have been spoken in any one of the past four decades. The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same, unfortunately. Ideological debates on this crisis have been happening in the House for many years. It is the view of Aontú and I that there is an ideological block inherent in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and the Greens, as their sidekicks, that prevents the resolution of the housing crisis. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael often see themselves as supporters of the free market and, yet, many of the actions they are taking distort the market more and more and keep it from functioning properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> The support of the Government for the Airbnb system is incredible. It has the effect of distorting the market, with the ludicrous situation whereby the majority of homes that are for rent in towns and cities in this State are for short-term rent by tourists. We have an incredibly ludicrous situation whereby families are staying in hotels and tourists are staying in homes. Aontú brought forward a Bill that would ban short-term rents in towns and cities of populations of more than 10,000 people. Again, however, the Government refuses to act in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> The Government has also distorted the market by providing taxation red carpets to real estate investment trusts, REITs, and international vulture funds. International vulture funds and REITs now compete with young, first-time buyers. They have lower interest rates and taxation and access to endless funds. The Government still allows for such taxation advantage for REITs in this State. That is incredible when you think about it. I grant that there has been a change in Government policy over the past two or three years. The Government has increased the level of funding that has gone into the sector. Some €25.8 billion has been spent on solving the housing crisis since 2017. We have seen a 180% increase in our annual housing budget in that period, but what the hell do we have to show for it? Where are the housing units for families at the end of that?</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> The truth is that if one follows that money, much of it is going into the pockets of private landlords, developers or international funds. The ideological barrier to fixing this is still rock solid within the Government. The Government is subsiding the market, but there have been no improvements to the level of housing development. Some €305 million of taxpayer's money was spent to lease social housing from private companies. We have a situation in which there are 70,000 HAP and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, tenancies throughout the country. This underscores the wholesale dependency of this Government policy on the private rental sector for social housing provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> Most of the so-called regulation that is being brought in to protect the tenant has more holes than a colander and no impact at all on the developers. Any investment in housing by the State must have a public good. There is no price discount in this plan. There are no affordability protections. There is no profitability limit for the developer at all. The money is being given to developers, irrespective of the profits they are making. Developers could receive this money. They could sell the apartments for €500,000 or €600,000 and still make a significant profit. The Government has put in no protections there. In many ways, this is social welfare by the Government for developers. It follows on from the party that socialised banking debt. It is the same ideological barrier again.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">I thank the Social Democrats and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for allowing us these couple of minutes this morning. We are sick and tired of the Government blathering, blowing and boasting about affordable houses and Housing for All. It will build 5,500 affordable houses for Dublin and the rest of the 7,500 houses are for the remainder of the country. However, no affordable house will be built in Kerry in the next five years. People are asking me day in and day out where the affordable houses are and when they will come on stream. The Government has no one on the list for Kerry for the next five years. People cannot get planning permission across half of the county. It is more or less sterilised, and the planning regulator is butting in again. He wants to sterilise more of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> I have nothing against the Ukrainians or any people coming into this country but surely the Government should make the same attempt for our own people in Killarney who have been on the list for 13, 14 or 15 years. That is the God's gospel truth. Families that are on the list for nine or ten years are thrown off it because they exceed the €33,600 limit. I have asked the Government to raise that cap. What house could be built with an income of €33,600? One could not build a henhouse to be honest. In the tenant purchase scheme the Government has in place, no one can built a house that is built after 2015. God almighty, someone may want to buy out a rural cottage that is built on their own land when they get on their feet but the Government has disallowed that. The money acquired from the tenant purchase scheme used to go into doing up voids. We have no money to do up voids in County Kerry. That is the God's gospel truth.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">The Government seems to be going around in circles talking. Practical things should be done, such as reintroducing the first-time buyers and builders grant scheme. This scheme was scrapped by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party when it was in government from 2007 to 2011. Fine Gael and Labour failed to reintroduce the scheme. Now is the time to reintroduce it and to provide grant aid directly to the young people who wish to build or buy a home for themselves. This scheme could help young people in rural areas in places such as County Kerry, where I am from, to proceed to build a home on their own land.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">However, for the scheme to work, a grant-aid package has to be made available to qualifying applicants.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> The Government seems to make a mess of the whole housing issue continuously. My clinics in the Dingle area on Monday night, held over seven and a half hours, were predominantly taken up by the issue of housing. Attendees wanted a house to buy or rent or to get a local authority home. Quite simply, they cannot get one. Since the area is nice and a beautiful part of the world, it is increasingly difficult to get planning permission on one's own land. Surely to God we should be able to allow those with a site to build on it because they are doing it for themselves. Look at how badly we have let people down because our local authority housing programme is so weak.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> I thank, as I always do, the staff in the housing department in Kerry County Council. They are excellent, from the director of services down to those working in every sector. If given enough money, they will take care of housing in County Kerry.</p>

          <p eId="para_284">Is it not wonderful that the Government is in a position to gift developers €450 million to subsidise the construction of apartments, all collected from fuel tax, income tax, motor tax and vehicle registration tax? It just shows that the worst-off in this country are the working-class people. The funds comprise a gift that does not have to be paid back. There is no cost–benefit analysis or regulatory assessment. The proposal is to give a subsidy of €144,000 per apartment. This policy does not make sense. At present, 120,000 people are on social or council housing waiting lists. In Limerick, there are 2,347 on the list. Under the scheme, a developer will get €120,000, with the subsidy to be as high as €144,000. With inflation this year running at 13%, costs could rise significantly, depending on building products. The cost of insulation is rising.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> Again, this is a city-based budget for developers. Where will most of the apartments be built? In Dublin. Does the Government not look beyond Dublin? Limerick county has no capacity or infrastructure. I have been saying it since I came here. The proposal does nothing for County Limerick or any other such county, including Kerry, Clare and Galway. It is all city based so the Government can get its numbers up and get additional Deputies in the cities to further close down rural Ireland. It is a matter of a city-based Cabinet, policies and infrastructure, with nothing for the towns and villages around rural Ireland. Many of the cities do not have the infrastructure to do what is proposed either.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">I thank the Social Democrats for tabling this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> Members of the public got €200 from the Government to help with the soaring cost of living but wealthy developers, the vast majority of which are multinational development companies, will get a handout of up to €144,000 each. The proposed scheme will be available only for apartment developments in the five major cities: Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. This policy is reckless and will do nothing to support the delivery of affordable houses. The scheme represents a social welfare or State handout for the biggest developers or builders in Ireland and there is no means test. What makes this obscene scheme worse is that the cash will be handed over without the Government seeking any reduction in the price when the apartments are sold. Yet again, we are doing nothing to help the first-time buyers. The proposal will help the bigger cities, as many have said before, but it will not help the ordinary people seeking houses in Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bantry, Bandon and many more places in west Cork. It is of no benefit whatsoever to them; as a matter of fact, it probably makes things worse for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> There is a massive housing crisis. I welcomed the visit of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to Skibbereen and Clonakilty last Friday but he did not announce money for a water scheme in Clonakilty. Clonakilty is now stifled; people cannot build there. Individuals cannot even get planning permission. It is a scandal that a growing town in west Cork has been left like that. We seem to have money for foreign developers in most cases. There is no problem at all for them but Clonakilty will be stifled and held back until we dish out all the money all over the country. Constituents of mine who come to my clinics every weekend cannot get a mortgage or council house. They have been waiting for ten or 12 years. Young people with a site at home are being refused planning permission but there is no problem with development and building, building, building. It is a matter of the Government pumping money into the wealthy. Where it gets the money when it suits it, I do not understand. Why has it not considered the counties? Why has it not considered a place such as west Cork, which badly needs money for development? The Minister has to wake up and understand that. Development in rural areas must not be stifled.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_289">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion and I thank the Social Democrats for tabling it.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> I believe I speak for everyone when I say the Government's decision to gift €450 million to developers is a massive slap in the face for the many in this country who are struggling with the cost of housing. Why is it always the priority of this Government to put developers first? Why do we allow this at the expense of our citizens?</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> I support this motion's proposal to scrap the subsidies at which the Government is throwing €450 million for the construction of apartments that will be sold at the full market price. The reality is that these apartments will be too expensive for most people to buy. Basically, we are using public funds to give to developers to build accommodation that will be too expensive for the public to buy. On top of that, the funds are to be spent without a cost–benefit analysis, regulatory assessment or independent cost evaluation. This is an appalling use of public funds. The money would be far better spent building affordable homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> The amendment to this motion put forward by the Government is very weak. Much like most of the answers to parliamentary questions that we receive, they do not lack in words or length but in substance. They state the Government is committed to supporting homeownership through a range of targeted measures, which is completely untrue. The Government may support ownership for those few who can afford the current extortionate rates but it certainly does not support homeownership for low- or even average-income families. It is completely disingenuous to suggest otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> This is further proven by the introduction of yet another scheme for the well-off: the first-home affordable-purchase shared-equity scheme. Much like the help-to-buy scheme, it does little to address the affordability challenges seen in most households today and only facilitates those on higher incomes to buy their house at a cheaper cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Have we not yet learned that pumping money into subsidies and schemes just does not work? What we need is direct investment in the building of affordable homes. Anything less is not addressing the issue, end of. We on this side of the House believe the outcome should be the provision of homes but the Government side believes the outcome should be the provision of wealth to developers. There is a difference, and a difference in tack.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> The Government cannot pretend that this issue is not a result of its bad housing policies. I note the Government amendment suggests the Covid-19 pandemic and global supply-chain disruption are to blame for the housing crisis today. That is amazing. It is as if we had not had a housing crisis at all before Covid-19. Who does the Government think it is fooling? This crisis was around long before Covid and everyone in this country knows that because everyone in this country has been affected by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> The Government amendment also suggests there has been a strong demand for urban living, with people wanting to live close to work. This just shows how out of touch this Government is. The constant focus on urban centres will only worsen this housing crisis. Our cities emptied during the pandemic, with many people returning or moving to rural areas and working from home. The suggestion that everyone wants to live in an urban centre is unfounded and simply wrong. My constituency, Donegal, saw an incredible influx of people over the course of the pandemic. People want to live where there are amenities, services and public transport connections. The pandemic made it clear that people would move to rural areas if they had these amenities. If the Government sought to invest in rural areas, it would encourage people to locate in them and put less pressure on urban areas; however, the Government is not interested in investing in solutions that actually make sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> Overall, I support this motion in its original form. If the Government were serious about the housing crisis, it would have supported it too without putting forward such a weak and disappointing amendment. The one thing pointed out to us all is that the Government is not interested in people who need housing; it is interested in supporting and making developers rich. For that reason, this motion works.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">Last week in Dublin City Council, there was a special meeting on O'Devaney Gardens. Councillors had the opportunity to withdraw from the rotten deal. The Labour Party, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party voted to maintain the deal. Bartra, the developer, was clearly in breach of the development agreement by not beginning construction within four weeks of the granting of planning permission. Planning permission was granted last September but Bartra chose to challenge it legally to ensure maximum profits. The site is a prime public city-centre site of 12 acres. Councillors gave it to a developer, committed to subsidising the infrastructure to the tune of €10 million and waived development levies of €5 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">That is free land and €15 million. In exchange, Dublin City Council will buy 30% of the homes for public housing, 20% for affordable purchase and the other 50% will be sold privately, and, no doubt, the State will end up renting a significant number of these homes under HAP, rent allowance or long-term leasing. In the worst-case scenario, an approved housing body will buy the majority of private homes for a vastly inflated cost to house tenants in public housing on what was formerly public land. We simply could not make this up. It is ideological madness but no surprise as the same Government has now set up a scheme that plans to give developers more than €450 million - over €100,000 per unit - for simply doing their job and building homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> I want to put on record that we were told strategic housing developments, SHDs, were imperative because we needed to build homes in the cities. On Davitt Road, 265 build-to-rent apartments have just been completed. It is an SHD and this is supposedly to build homes but 238 of these have been sold to Google and 27 will be allocated to Dublin City Council. The people in Drimnagh, where this was built, will not be able to access these one-bedroom and two-bedroom rental apartments. This shows the ideological madness of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> I support the motion from Deputy Cian O'Callaghan. The Government's scheme is not about creating affordability for those on ordinary incomes. It is clear from this scheme that, at best, it will lock in the sky-high and unaffordable prices and, at worst, will drive up housing prices even further as developers will simply price in the subsidy. As was stated in the Dáil last Thursday, the scheme will provide nothing for people who want to purchase affordable homes. Instead, first-time buyers will still have to pay up to €600,000 for apartments and houses that will be sold at market prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> This plan is fatally flawed. The €450 million is a direct subsidy for developers, which is insane. It is essentially the State taking on the risk for developers but the developers will be able to get all of the profit margin for these apartment developments. The Government is removing the risk for developers, it is removing everything that a developer is meant to do, so why does the Government not just become the developer? It is crazy. Every scheme that has been brought in has been geared towards developers making huge profit margins and the communities are left to scramble for what the Government is providing.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> At the housing committee in April, Dublin City Council outlined a plan for the next five years. The total number of housing units to be built was 14,338, which includes long-term leasing, regeneration projects and advance planning and design acquisitions. That is in five years but there are 13,100 people and families on the housing list in Dublin City Council now and more than 5,000 HAP tenants looking to transfer. That is a total of 18,000 and we are talking about potentially building 14,300, despite all of the other tenants who will come onto the housing list in the coming years. This plan is incredibly destructive. We have enough publicly-zoned land controlled by the State, Dublin City Council, the other councils and NAMA to build 100,000 homes. That is what we need to do to solve the crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I sometimes wonder if the sponsors of the motion represent the same city that I do. The core problem in my constituency is that new high-density compact development is simply too expensive for first-time buyers. The old model, whereby modest builders sold to homeowners, is not able to mobilise these sites. As a result of that, what we have seen in recent times is that the REITs have moved in to purchase, for example, at Griffith Avenue and the Shieling development, and it is not only the REITs as the housing bodies have also moved in to buy in Beaumont and Coolock and at Blackbanks, which Deputy Cian O'Callaghan will know.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> We have to fix that model because the traditional model will not deliver. As the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, will know, we need compact development for climate reasons. We have to be aware that this logjam has to be broken. In Dublin city in the last four years, planning permission was granted for 29,000 but only one third of those have been activated, so there are currently 19,000 in limbo. By contrast, in the other three Dublin authorities, 75% of those that got permission have moved on to commence and build. We have a logjam in the cities, and it is not just Dublin. In my constituency alone, there are 8,000 such homes blocked in that position and they would not be triggered unless, under the policy up to now, the REITs or one of the housing charities came along and bought them.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> What we are doing here is developing a way of unblocking that. The strategy the Government has developed has three strands. First, there is the State developer, which I believe Deputy Joan Collins has overlooked, that is, the Land Development Agency, which under Project Tosaigh will activate these sites. It is actively going to find those sites and get them moving and, as I said, there are 8,000 such units in my constituency and 19,000 across the city. The second element is the subsidy we are now talking about, which reduces the price of those very high-spec homes to home buyers in these high-density developments. The third element, which we will see in the forthcoming budget, is taxation of vacant sites. In my view, this is a balanced package of activist intervention by the State and it is the correct way to address this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> The Opposition seeks to depict this as a subsidy to developers. The reality is this will ensure that ordinary home buyers can go in and get these homes at a cheaper price than those who want to buy for buy-to-rent purposes, be they REITs or individuals. Of course, the value of that money expended has to be tracked and we have to make sure we get full value for it, but it means there will be a lower price for first-time buyers in these estates. That is something we need. The trouble with the Opposition motion is that it deplores falling rates of home ownership but it opposes help-to-buy, which 32,000 people will take advantage of, it opposes shared equity, which 8,000 people will take advantage of, and it now opposes this, which is another 5,000 homes that we can deliver. We have the highest rate of social housing provision ever in the history of the State, although, from listening to the Opposition, no one would realise that. We need to correct affordable housing and that is what this initiative is about.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">I am not going to get into the intricacies of what the solutions are for Dublin. I just want to commend the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, on all of their efforts. One thing I know from the many contacts I have in the city is that demand for housing is savage. This is an effort to come up with novel ideas and new ways of doing things, as Deputy Bruton pointed out in regard to the State-led Land Development Agency, which has been in the making for a number of years. Any proposal to try to provide building solutions for the many people who are in desperate need to start their families, start the next phase of their lives and get independence from home, has to be commended. I want to acknowledge the Minister and the Minister of State for their work in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> Closer to home, I want to make a couple of points. I want to acknowledge the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, for his efforts to try to move forward as quickly as possible with the mica legislation. It is very important that we start to move on that. The frustration continues to build and, in the meantime, many councillors in Donegal are advocating very strongly for modular housing for mica families while they are waiting for their houses to be rebuilt or to get the outer leaf done. We have to really look at something within the mica legislation to allow modular build in the short term. If we go through the normal channels and planning processes, with third-party objections, that will not fit the timeline of what is needed in the short term. I believe we need to look at the all-encompassing demands on housing that we have at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> I led a delegation to Romania recently and we met with many politicians in Bucharest. Romania has a dedicated sectoral working group on housing to deal with the current demands in terms of local housing need but also the pressure of 100,000 Ukrainians coming into the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">They are looking at an all-encompassing solution for their home needs and that of Ukrainians in totality, rather than doing them in isolation because that creates its own social difficulties in terms of segregating people. We have a great opportunity in this country if we are considering modular solutions for Ukrainian families to consider an all-encompassing model. I used the example in my county of mica families who will need short-term housing. </p>
          <p eId="para_313"> The second point I would like to make is that many houses built 20 years ago had three or four bedrooms because families had three, four, five or six children. Many of these children have moved on and families will want to downsize. They may not want to build a house with the same footprint. The Minister of State will consider scenarios whereby when people build a house with the same footprint they will not have to apply for planning permission because that takes away the incentive for families to downsize. </p>
          <p eId="para_314"> I again reiterate that I do not think people who want to downsize should have to go through the planning process not only because it takes away the incentive, but because it also opens things up to third-party objections. People in a 2,500 sq. ft. house may want to downsize to a house of about 1,500 sq. ft. or 1,800 sq. ft. They would have to go through planning and there could potentially be third-party objections where somebody is trying to replace a home. We have to consider something within the legislation to provide incentives rather than the current disincentives in regard to downsizing.</p>

          <p eId="para_315">I believe Deputy Ó Broin said earlier that the majority of uncommenced apartments with full planning permission are in the buy to rent sector. I wanted to correct that, because there are twice as many apartments, around 19,000, in the build to sell sector with full planning permission that have not yet commenced. Only about half of that number are in the build to rent sector. The scheme is exclusively for build to sell.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> Research has shown that the State needs, on average, 33,000 houses to be built every year to 2030. Additional supply is also needed to respond to the number of Ukrainian refugees we are committed to helping. The Government is determined to deliver an additional average of 11,000 social homes each year and 6,000 new homes under affordable housing arrangements each year. With this scheme, we are delivering support for the first-time buyers, right size housing and housing for our increasingly urban population. Far from gifting developers money, this scheme is about bringing much needed additional apartment supply on stream quickly. It will deliver 5,000 units. Prospective homeowners will be the beneficiaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> It will offer additional choice to households who want to live in cities in areas that are accessible in terms of public transport infrastructure, and are close to work and other social amenities and services. This is an opportunity to help reimagine how we live and work in our cities. Over the longer term, other measures in Housing for All will act to reduce the cost of building apartments and reduce the price of development land. In the meantime, we need to get these 5,000 ready to go new apartments built. Apartments are key to delivering the national planning framework objective of compact urban growth, sustainable communities and vibrant liveable cities and reducing urban sprawl, which presents us with so many challenges, including unsustainable emission levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> Those who want to live in the heart of our cities must have choices available other than renting. Without this scheme, new apartment owner occupation will not be available, except at the higher and more expensive end of the market. Without this scheme, only buy to rent apartments are likely to be built.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_319">Affordability for the buyer and the State is the fundamental issue in our housing market, but one would not think it looking at the Government's housing policies. We are repeatedly told that supply is the answer. While this is undoubtedly part of the solution, it is not a silver bullet the Government would have us believe because so much of it is the wrong sort of supply, namely, unaffordable small rental units.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> Housing is too expensive. That is the crux of this issue. Just ask anyone looking to rent or buy. The problem is that they do not have the ear of the Government. Developers do. Successive Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage have bent over backwards to address developers' so-called viability concerns, and this Minister is no different. Last year, <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that the CIF had made 61 representations to Government in the first ten months of the year. That absolutely beggars belief. </p>
          <p eId="para_321"> The Minister knows full well that this approach to housing policy, where developers, landowners and investment funds dictate housing policy, does not work because the only people who win are those calling the shots. This latest policy, namely, a direct subsidy for developers, represents a continuation of this deeply flawed approach to housing policy development, if one can even call it that in the absence of any cost-benefit analysis, independent cost evaluation or regulatory assessment. This just smacks of another proposal that was written on the back of an envelope and accepted by a Government that is all too willing to appease developers. </p>
          <p eId="para_322"> This insidious relationship between the Custom House and the sector has had a particularly profound effect on our planning laws, which are inextricably linked to housing, something that is not lost on the construction lobbyists. Since 2015, we have seen what was a reasonably decent planning framework being transformed into a developers' charter. These attacks on the planning system began when the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, introduced mandatory section 20 guidelines. This paved the way for unrestricted building heights and slashed apartment standards. His successors, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the former Minister and Deputy, Eoin Murphy, oversaw the failed fast track SHD process and retrograde build to rent schemes with even lower building standards. We were told the changes were necessary to bridge the viability gap supposedly faced by developers. All they achieved was greater dysfunction in the market. </p>
          <p eId="para_323"> Now the Government is set to subsidise developers to the tune of €144,000 per apartment. When these apartments come to market, the Housing Agency estimates they will cost up to a whopping €450,000. How can the Minister of State honestly stand over this egregious use of taxpayers' money? These funds should be used to build affordable purchase and cost rental homes, not gifted to developers. The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is utterly misguided if he believes for one second that the market can be relied upon to deliver affordable homes. </p>
          <p eId="para_324"> We already know that this dysfunctional market is yielding the wrong types of home, namely, unaffordable shoebox apartments. Analysis undertaken by KPMG for the city development plan shows that there was an increase demand for two and three person household accommodation and declining demand for single person households and one bed units. Yet, the Government is proposing a payday for the very people who are failing to meet this demand simply because studios and one bed are more profitable. What else should we expect from the Government? </p>
          <p eId="para_325"> Developers will always chase the maximum return on their investment. In so doing, the Government is locking a whole swathe of society out of homeownership and locking others into exorbitant mortgages and rents. It is time to abandon this sweetheart deal for developers and address the real problem, which is affordability for the buyer and the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">I thank Deputies from different parties and groups who have spoken on the motion. During the debate we witnessed something I had not seen before. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, who is not shy for words, was utterly silent when we put three questions to him, questions the public have a right to know the answers to given that he wants to gift €450 million of public money to developers. We asked him if developers and their lobbyists were involved in dreaming up this scheme. There was no answer, just complete silence and no response. Why would he not answer that question? We asked why there was no cost-benefit analysis or economic or regulatory assessment of the scheme. There was total silence and no answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Why will he not tell us about that? Why will he not carry out that evaluation so we can find out what the scheme will do? Why will he not answer questions about what this will do to land prices? There is no answer; it is utter silence from the Minister. He will not tell us anything he thinks about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> We asked the Minister what level of profit would be guaranteed to developers under this scheme. Will developers who are seeking 15% minimum profits, which they define as viable for apartment construction, get those profits subsidised through public money? There was zero answer from the Minister to that. He had nothing to say. There was no comment, just total silence. Why will he and the Government not answer the very legitimate questions we are putting about the use of €450 million of public money the Government is going to hand over to developers? I asked the Minister if he could give an example of a single country in the world where a government is behaving in this way by gifting such money to private developers. He had nothing to say. There was utter silence, with no answer or comment on that. Why will he and the Government not answer the legitimate questions we are putting to them when they are seeking to gift €450 million of public money to developers?</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> I wish to respond to the Minister of State with regard to what the Social Democrats stand for in housing policy. I will be very clear about this. We stand for measures that make housing more affordable and we are opposed to measures that put upward pressure on rents and house prices to make housing and rents less affordable. We oppose all the Government's measures in that regard, including this off-the-wall scheme. This is the same Government that is putting more than €1 billion in subsidies every year into the pockets of investment funds and private landlords through rent subsidies and long-term leases. It is not an accident that we live in a country that has some of the highest rents and house prices compared with those of European Union capital cities. It is no accident because every time the Government intervenes in housing it brings forward measures that create upward pressure on rents and house prices, as it is doing with this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> The Government has no mandate for this. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party did not tell the electorate during the last general election that they should vote for those parties because they would give €450 million of the electorate's hard-earned money to developers. They did not tell people about that. There was not even a whisper of it during the election campaign. They have no mandate whatsoever for it. Then the Government will not even answer the very legitimate questions we have put about this today. There is zero answer. Why did the Government parties not come clean with the electorate during the last election that this was their plan if that is what they intended to do? I call on Government Deputies to join Opposition Deputies today and to vote down these horrendous plans, to scrap these plans, to put this money and these resources instead into building affordable purchase homes, and to use this funding as it should be used. We should be increasing home ownership, but under this Government home ownership continues to fall year after year, while rents and house prices increase.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">Yesterday, I again raised with the Taoiseach the importance of the Government securing public ownership of the site on which the new national maternity hospital will be built. I also expressed my astonishment that neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Health had made any substantial effort to convince St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to transfer that land to the State. Furthermore, I proposed that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, should meet urgently with the board of that group to negotiate such a transfer. This clean, clear transaction would be the best outcome as it would ensure that we would have a public maternity hospital built on public land. That is what the Sinn Féin motion, which is to be voted on by the Dáil tonight, calls for. The Taoiseach stated that the Government will not oppose the motion, so can I take it that the Government's position is to secure State ownership of the land and that it will now engage in that high-level negotiation with St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to achieve this? That will be the position of the Dáil after tonight's vote and the Government should act on its instruction.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> The public want clarity, but the truth is that the Government has sown confusion, distrust and unease about its plan. We have had two weeks of a consultation that was not really a consultation at all. The Taoiseach said that he was open to changes and suggestions, but he ignored and pushed back all suggestions and went ahead with the original deal. He and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, said they engaged with St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to secure State ownership of the land, but St. Vincent's Healthcare Group said they did not and the Taoiseach responded by saying that he did. The Sinn Féin motion articulates a clear call for public ownership of the site and it is now clear that the Government will, in effect, support that motion. Let us get the clarity that people want. State ownership of the site is the best way to safeguard an investment of almost €1 billion of taxpayers' money. It is also the best way to end conclusively any fear of residual religious dogma compromising the delivery of health services for women. I do not have to rehearse again the harrowing history that gives rise to such anxieties.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> Everybody in the Dáil and beyond wants the new hospital built. We want and need a new era in maternity care for women in Ireland, and we should accept and acknowledge each other's bona fides in that regard. However, we must get this right. We have to get the best deal and the best arrangement to achieve that ambition. Ba cheart don Rialtas an rud ceart a dhéanamh anois. Ba cheart dóibh dul i dteagmháil le Grúpa Sláinte Naomh Uinseann chun an suíomh seo a fháil faoi úinéireacht an Stáit. The Sinn Féin motion this evening presents an opportunity for everyone to vote for the best approach. Given that the Taoiseach is not opposing the motion, will he commit to leading the Government in an engagement with St Vincent's Healthcare Group to secure this site in State ownership?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_94">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_335">First, this has been an interesting debate. What has struck me are the attempts to sort of reverse the truth or to rename the truth and to make a declaration, which the Deputy has been making consistently, in the hope that it becomes the truth and develops into a new truism, which is that 300 years of a lease at €10 per year is somehow not ownership. It is ownership; it is public ownership. The Deputy is endeavouring to create the premise that somehow it is not full ownership. It is, and it is for most sensible people dealing with this area historically. That emerged in the committee, by the way. All the legal people with experience in the area of leasing, conveyancing and so forth accept that 300 years at €10 per year is ownership. The Deputy has created this false idea that there is some dramatic difference between 300 years of a lease for €10 per year and full outright ownership of the site. In my view, it is very false. The Deputy asked that we all accept each other's bona fides, although she then said that we are deliberately sowing confusion and doubt, which we are not doing. This deal represents a strengthening of the deal that was agreed through the mediation of Mr. Kieran Mulvey in 2017. This enhances it because what we sought was a strengthening and extension of the lease, which was originally 99 years with an option of 50 years in the Mulvey deal. It is now 300 years, so there is no issue with ownership. That is the first point.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> The State's interest is guaranteed, and there is value for money in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">No matter how long we think a hospital would last, it is safe enough to say if it has a lifespan of 300 years, it would be some hospital in terms of how it is going to get built. I want to nail this idea. In my view too, a lot of fog and confusion are being created around this. It does not hold water, and it has not held up to robust argument in the committee or throughout the past two weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> The other key issue among the range of issues that were raised relates to what services will be provided in the new hospital and if there would be any religious ethos influencing the provision of such services. Again, there are cast-iron, watertight guarantees contained in the new hospital's constitution, in the operating licence from the HSE to the new hospital, in the Minister's golden share, which empowers the Minister to direct the directors of the new hospital to make sure that all legally permissible services are provided, with which they must legally comply. Those were legitimate concerns that were raised last year and prior to that in terms of whether there would be any potential to undermine the provision of such services through some religious influence or other. There are cast-iron, watertight legal guarantees provided in that respect. The guarantees are multilayered in terms of the various documents that underpin both the constitution of the hospital, the operating licence, and the activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> The most powerful voice of all has been the voice of women involved in maternity care in this country. The national directors of midwifery across the length and breadth of the country have pleaded with the Government to get this hospital built. The director of midwifery at Holles Street and the assistant directors of midwifery have all pleaded with the Government to get this hospital built. The clinicians at Holles Street have all asked that we would now take the decision to build the new hospital. It was decided to build this hospital in 2013 and it is now 2022. We genuinely need to commence the construction phase of this hospital given all of the guarantees that are now in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">Indeed it is time. That is nine long years. For a very long time women in midwifery, and all concerned in obstetrics and the care and provision of services for women, have been calling for proper investment in maternity services and health services for women. There is no great surprise in that. We all share that ambition. The hospital has to get built.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> The only fog and confusion are what is generated by the Taoiseach. I asked him a question. We have a motion coming before the Dáil this evening, which is crystal clear. It sets out very clearly a call from the Oireachtas for full public ownership of the land. To be clear, by that I mean a clean transfer of ownership in perpetuity to the State of that site. I understand that the Government will support the motion, or at least it does not propose to vote against it. Therefore, I can only surmise that the Government accepts that the best outcome is full ownership in that manner. Given that the Government will support the motion, or at least will not oppose it, I ask the Taoiseach if he will act on the will of the Dáil and if he will engage with St. Vincent's Healthcare Group-----</p>

          <from>Deputy Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_363">It has become clear, in particular in recent days that the optimal solution to the issue of the national maternity hospital for both the Opposition and the Government is that of full public ownership - freehold ownership, not the conditional ownership represented by leasehold, however long it may be. I ask the Taoiseach again to take into account the clear and overwhelming majority of those of us in the Opposition who wish to see the hospital built on publicly owned land, who are concerned to see €1 billion of State money going into the building of a hospital on what will not ultimately be State-owned land, on land that is going to be held on a conditional ownership basis for the duration of that leasehold. That is the issue on which we have been focusing in the Labour Party, but also all of us across so many Opposition parties. I again ask that that might be taken into account, in particular if the Government is not proposing to contest the motion tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> Could I also refer again to the context for the maternity hospital, and to the point so many of us have made in the debates in recent days and weeks, that for far too long the State has invested so much public money into the building of schools and hospitals on land and sites not owned by the State, but rather that are owned in many cases by religious orders or by their proxies or successor companies? That lack of State investment over many years has failed so many people, in particular women and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> I wish to raise in particular an issue that was brought to light last night on RTÉ's "Prime Time" about the failure of the State to provide adequate services and supports for children with autism. We heard last night in particular about the challenges facing Gillian and Darren Milne, who have fought year after year for their twin sons, Ryan and Kyle, to get access to appropriate places in a special school. Last night was the second time in a number of years that their battle has been covered on "Prime Time".</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> The Taoiseach raised the case himself on Leaders' Questions nearly three years ago, in September 2019 and the then Taoiseach said the case of the Milne children was under consideration by the Minister for Education. The boys were then eight and now they are 11 and still awaiting an appropriate place. The parents are really struggling, as so many parents are. This is a huge issue across my constituency in Dublin Bay South. Miriam Kenny from Involve Autism was on "Morning Ireland" this morning speaking about the struggles so many parents in Dublin face. This is a countrywide issue and everywhere we go, we hear about the difficulties with accessing places for children with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> I am conscious that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, did speak on the radio this morning about her new forecasting model, which will enable better long-term planning to ensure there will be adequate places available for children with autism. However, we have not seen any real indication of movement on that, nor did we hear any indication of the extent of the need, the number of children waiting on places. It is very welcome that the Minister of State has said she has had no option but to issue section 37A notices to schools and that she intends to follow up on that, but there is no indication as to when that will be done or how many places it will generate. I ask the Taoiseach for more clarity on what will be done for children in this position.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_368">I will deal with the issue on which the Deputy has focused in Leaders' Questions. I have dealt enough with the hospital today. I watched that programme. It is not good enough. The State has failed the Milne family, and Ryan and Kyle in particular, in terms of providing a proper, comprehensive education for the children that would be appropriate to their complex needs. They have applied to two schools and been refused.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> This morning I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan. I also spoke to the recently appointed CEO of the National Council for Special Education and the assistant secretary in the Department of Education. All are possessed with the need that this does not happen again. In the past two years there has been significant expansion of special school places, but new special schools were also created. There are three new schools, two already established and a further one to be established - two in Cork and one in Dublin. Apparently, it is the first time in more than a decade that new special schools have been established.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I apologise to the Milne family on behalf of the Government, because it simply is not good enough. I do not stand over this. There is an absence of proactivity in the system. The people to whom I spoke today are all possessed with getting this right. There are a number of things that we need to do. The Minister of State first of all has been working on expanding capacities within existing special schools, some of which are running out of space. Some are saying that they cannot take additional students. The other action is to create new schools. My own view is that we must bring in the education and training boards, ETBs, more and more to establish new special schools in their areas of jurisdiction. From the State’s perspective, into the future the ETBs will now take a lead in providing special schools. I know that National Council for Special Education, NCSE, will be in touch with the City of Dublin ETB in relation to that. That is what happened last year. Existing organisations have provided over the years and they will continue to do so. However, we need to broaden capacity. </p>
          <p eId="para_371"> In the immediate short term, the Department and the Minister of State are looking at those existing schools to which applications have been made and whether additional space can be created elsewhere in order to facilitate the children who are without places.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> We also need stronger legislation. No longer can it be an option for schools to say, “We are not taking in children with special needs”. Some years ago, the House brought in amendments to section 37A of the Education Act. These are not strong enough in my view. They are too bureaucratic. The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act needs to be reviewed. The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 needs to be reviewed, in my view, as does the Education Act 1998. There is a collective responsibility on all schools to take children with special needs. </p>

          <from>Deputy Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_373">I thank the Taoiseach for his full response. I am sure the apology will be very much welcomed by those who have been so badly failed. The Taoiseach speaks of an absence of proactivity and the need for stronger legislation. Yet clearly, there is a responsibility on the Government to take those proactive steps and to deliver the amendments to legislation that are needed. This is not just about the provision of special schools. It is also about providing adequate supports for children in mainstream schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> The issue of SNA allocation in particular has been difficult and problematic for many schools. My colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, last Thursday. He was seeking clarity on when the allocation of special needs assistants will be made. Just as with the section 37A notices, it is simply not good enough for schools, and especially for parents and children, to have to wait until the eleventh hour to hear whether an SNA allocation has been made or if a section 37A notice has been issued. There is a lack of forward planning and a lack of availability, particularly for secondary school places. We are seeing a pinch there for so many parents and children. </p>
          <p eId="para_375"> The absence of proactivity is the responsibility of the Government. I agree the Taoiseach that there has been an absence of proactivity, but we need to see proactivity from the Government on this, in the interests of children. </p>

          <p eId="para_376">The Government is proactive on this. The NCSE is very focused on the current legislative framework and on this on an operational level. Under the Acts that I have mentioned, very often the onus is put on the parents to seek to places. In my view, the system should be seeking the places for the child. That is the fundamental change that must occur. That requires an automatic response from the State whereby, when children with complex needs require provision, the State goes and finds the place for them. This is opposed to what is done at the moment, which is to say to the parents that they must apply to four or five schools in an area. This is not a question of resources. Some 25% of the Department's budget, correctly, is spent on special education. The sum is over €2 billion. This is an issue of matching the resources to the needs in given geographic locations and areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> This is also a matter of everybody playing their role. The NCSE and the Department have had to engage with certain schools in the past month. These were schools that had special classes built. They have had to say, “You must take in children”. It is not on any more.</p>

          <p eId="para_386">This morning, I visited the picket line of medical scientists at Tallaght University Hospital. They are among the more than 2,000 members of the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association, MLSA, who are on strike today. By the way, the public support for them and the support from patients were quite overwhelming. These are the hidden heroes of our health service. They are the people who process test samples for Covid-19, who do blood tests and who test urine and stool samples. They have been under intense pressure during the Covid-19 crisis. Many of them are now suffering burnout as a result of problems with recruitment and retention, which mean that one in five medical scientist places are currently unfilled.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> Their work is vital for modern medical treatment. The medical services that we all rely on depend on them being there and on them carrying out their specialised work. However, the Government, in its mistreatment of these workers, has brought us to the point of a serious crisis. Over 10,000 outpatient appointments were cancelled today as a result. </p>
          <p eId="para_388"> These hidden heroes are shamefully paid 8% less than clinical biochemists, who do a very similar job. Pay parity was recommended back in 2001 by an expert group. That was accepted by the HSE and the Department of Health. Yet, more than two decades on, it has not been implemented. The workers described to me a situation whereby laboratory aides have a starting salary that is higher than that of medical scientists. Therefore, there is a situation where many people start over the summer as laboratory aides, because they cannot then start as medical scientists. They then have to take a pay cut in order to become the more highly qualified medical scientists.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> Now, like most workers across the country, they are feeling the impact of the cost-of-living crisis. Their rent is going up, their electricity costs are going up, their petrol or diesel costs are going up but yet, their wages are not going up. Enough is enough for them. They need action on pay parity in order that they can survive. They need action to fill the one in five medical scientist positions that are unfilled as a result of the underinvestment into our health service. </p>
          <p eId="para_390"> The strength of anger and of feeling of these workers was demonstrated by the vote in favour of industrial action last November, when they voted 98% in favour of action. They were due to strike in March but postponed that to facilitate further negotiations. There was, however, no meaningful offer from the HSE. Now they have no choice but to go ahead with strike action today. If there are not meaningful negotiations, they will go ahead with two days of strike action next week and with three days the following week. They are looking for the Taoiseach to intervene, to direct the HSE to sit down with the workers’ representatives and agree to grant pay parity and to filling the unfilled posts. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_130">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_391">As I did yesterday, I again take the opportunity to recognise the hugely important and vital work carried out by medical scientists, as well as their role in respect of the functioning of our health service. They are dedicated, professional and highly committed and have been so for many years. This was particularly the case during the pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> There is a long-standing concern. The Medical Laboratory Scientists Association has had an ongoing long-term concern in relation to pay and career structure of the medical scientist grade. They want pay parity between medical scientists and clinical biochemists. The health sector management has been engaging with the MLSA regarding these issues under the existing public service agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> As I said, the public service agreement group, which is comprised of union and Civil Service representatives and which has an independent chair, met on 11 May to consider the matter. They recommended that the matter be immediately referred to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and that industrial peace be maintained in the meantime. There was engagement between the parties yesterday at the WRC. I believe the parties should continue at the WRC. Ultimately, industrial disputes of this kind have to be resolved through the existing labour and industrial relations mechanisms. That is the most effective way to do this, because there are implications and there are always consequences and relativities. These issues are never simple or straightforward in industrial relations terms, particularly within the health service. This potentially has further, wider repercussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">All those issues have to be teased through and worked through. The most important forum in which to do that is the WRC or whatever forum within the industrial relations machinery is optimal for the resolution of this particular dispute. I hope that while talks are continuing, the strike action could be lifted because such action will and does impact on patients. Of that there is no doubt, given the central and very important role medical scientists perform in our health service. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_395">The Taoiseach described this as a long-standing issue. For workers suffering because of low pay, 21 years is very long-standing when we have an expert group recommendation that is simply not being implemented. There has been a passing of the buck throughout this whole process. When the MLSA negotiate with the HSE, the HSE states the problem is it cannot get the money from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but that Department is not in the room at the WRC, for example. If the Taoiseach is pointing to the WRC, does he not agree the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should be in the room at the WRC for the negotiations? It is the one that is or is not doling out the money, as the case may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> I urge the Taoiseach not to also pass the buck. Ultimately, he is the Taoiseach; the Head of Government. It is a very simple issue in terms of pay parity. It is an issue that has been recognised by the expert group, whose recommendation the HSE and the Department of Health agreed to implement. The Taoiseach should send a direction to the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform saying we will address these workers' very legitimate concern, especially in the context of the cost-of-living crisis, the fact they are owed an 8% pay rise and, as inflation is now at 8%, that this is the very least they need. If the Government does not act, the Taoiseach has the responsibility. By just asking workers to lift the strike action - when they did that previously meaningful negotiations did not result - the Government will be responsible for the disruption of tens of thousands of outpatient appointments next week and even more the following week. </p>

          <p eId="para_397">As I said, the most effective way to resolve this issue is through the labour relations machinery and industrial relations machinery of the State. It is the most effective way to resolve all disputes of this kind and, ultimately, the only way to do it. That is understood and accepted across all the social partners in respect of disputes in the public and private sectors. As I said, there was engagement between the parties at the WRC yesterday. It is important those talks continue and the existing industrial relations machinery is fully utilised because that is the ultimate way of ensuring we can get a resolution to this.</p>

          <p eId="para_405">I wish to raise some concerns I have around the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant scheme for third level students. I do this, however, while acknowledging the good work the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, has done and the fact he has initiated some much-needed reform in this area, particularly around the regulations to increase the maintenance grant by €200 and to increase the income threshold for the standard rate of grant by €1,000. That is certainly welcome, but my concern relates specifically to the fact that despite the steering group review of the SUSI scheme and the Minister's action, the income threshold for student holiday earnings has remained capped at the totally unacceptable level of €4,500.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> I raised the need to increase this earnings limit as part of my submission to the steering group last March. I was hopeful, along with others, such as the Union of Students in Ireland, this limit would be changed. Indeed, the last time the level of holiday earnings income was increased was in 2016, when the cap rose from €3,809 to €4,500. Since that time, students and the majority of people in this State, have faced massive and unsustainable levels of rent hikes, travel expenses and food price increases yet, despite all of this, the cap on earnings students can generate for themselves remains at the same level almost seven years on. That is totally unacceptable. The fact it did not change as part of the recent regulations the Minister, Deputy Harris, signed off on was certainly a lost opportunity and one that needs to be addressed and looked at again.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> I asked the Minister, in a recent parliamentary question following his announcement, if he would reconsider the decision to leave the cap at €4,500 for student holiday earnings. He ruled this out by replying, "Any .. further increase [to the holiday earnings] threshold must be considered in the context of not adversely impacting upon retention rates [and] the student’s ability to primarily focus on successfully completing his [or] her studies." I respectfully suggest it is precisely this rigid inflexibility around student earnings that is creating the difficulties in retention and the ability of students to successfully complete their courses. In other words, a cap that is apparently designed to keep students in college or third level is now acting as a direct disincentive and a barrier to graduation. This is also having an impact on the retail and hospitality sectors, which cannot source students to do work because students cannot take on the number of hours they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> I specifically request that the Government and the Minister immediately re-examine section 22(5)<i>(b</i>) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021 with a view to increasing the maximum earning caps from €4,500, even if that occurs on an incremental level equivalent to the increase that took place in 2016. </p>

          <p eId="para_409">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. As she said, she has made a submission in respect of it to the group looking at reform of the SUSI scheme. As she said, at the last budget, the Government took a number of decisions to improve the student grant scheme, in particular the increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant of €200 per year, which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance grant. The income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant increased to €1,000 and the qualifying distance criterion, which is an important one, for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant will be reduced from 45 km to 30 km. These were all positive measures the Government took on the last occasion. It also provided additional funding to the student assistance fund for students eligible for higher education institutions who were experiencing financial difficulties in college. That fund can be very useful to students who are in particular difficulties financially, in supporting students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and in providing emergency financial support. In the 2021-22 academic year, that fund is now €18.5 million, which is quite substantial.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> The Exchequer contributes approximately €340 million to meeting tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate students in higher education and spends €365 million on student grant supports via SUSI. In addition, the Exchequer pays the student contribution of €3,000 per annum, in full or part, for circa 66,000 students. That said, we are anxious to do more, especially on the student support side and the SUSI grant size. We will, in the context of the next budget, examine what more can be done to improve access to student grants and the various criteria governing the SUSI scheme. We will examine some of the suggestions the Deputy made in the context of the Estimates for the subsequent academic year beyond the next budget. That is the context in which this will be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> The Deputy made reasonable points. On what the Minister, Deputy Harris, said, there is a balance to be struck, to be fair, in maintaining focus on study and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Equally, however, the threshold is perhaps an area that can be examined into the future in terms of the earnings cap of €4,500. We will certainly examine that.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">The real problem is that the cap of €4,500 relating to student earnings is extremely low. There is inflation and people are struggling to cope with the cost of living. Students are no different. We have spiralling rent costs, as I have already outlined. It would make sense to do something that would act as an incentive to ensure that we invest in students in this country and that there would not be a situation whereby they are emigrating because they are being forced to leave education here. Unfortunately, the student earning cap is a barrier that forces many students out of third level education because they just cannot pay for accommodation or meet different cost-of-living requirements. I ask that perhaps this be looked at. We could increase it incrementally over time. That could be done or started in budget 2023. I accept that it will not be possible to increase it to the rate we would like it to be at all at once. However, it needs to be seriously considered in the context of budget 2023, particularly as we are failing our students. Our brightest and best are being forced to drop out of education.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">There is significant investment in third level education by the Government. Participation rates continue to increase. We have perhaps one of the highest participation rates in third level education across the European Union and we have one of the highest completion rates for second level.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> The first priority has to be to make sure that our third level institutions have adequate core funding to ensure a quality education for all those who access third level. There is a gap there, which was shown in the recent report the Minister received. There is a significant gap in terms of what the universities and the institutes of technology require. We need to narrow that gap in terms of core funding in our third level institutions. </p>
          <p eId="para_416"> Second, we need to reform the student grant scheme, as we can and if resources permit, in the context of ensuring access, especially for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. In particular, postgraduate education needs to be made more accessible from a cost perspective.</p>

Gillian and Darren have struggled for years to secure the appropriate services and school placement for their young boys. In his response to Deputy Bacik, it sounded as though the Taoiseach was laying culpability for this at the feet of schools. I want to challenge that. I accept absolutely that the legislative framework has to ensure inclusion, and not for one moment will I carry the can for any school that would seek to exclude a child. However, there has to be a level of honesty here. There is absolutely an issue around resourcing, also. Furthermore, the courts in this land have found that the Government has broken the law in respect of the Disability Act 2005. The State has not been honourable-----</p>

          <p eId="para_421">To be fair to Deputy Bacik, she decided to prioritise this issue for Leaders’ Questions. I thought I had dealt with it comprehensively at that point. Deputy McDonald is wrong to put words in my mouth, as she sought to do. I have not apportioned culpability to anybody. However, I stand over what I said earlier. There has to be a collective obligation in terms of accepting children with special needs into all schools. The Minister will be meeting with the Milne family on Thursday. It is not a question of resources. I am clear about that. Resources will be provided. The issue in many respects is expanding the existing special schools, creating new schools and working with other providers to make sure we can create a sufficiency of new places in new schools, which we are going to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_422">Deputy Bacik raised the issue of passports yesterday. I ask that we might have a further articulation of the issue in the House and I call on the Government to make time for statements on it. First-time applications for passports were taking 40 working days in 2021. We are all now dealing with cases where first-time applications are taking 12, 13, 14 weeks and more. There is a serious issue at play for people who want to travel next week and the week after and who are fearful that they just will not have their passports on time, even though they applied in good time. Can consideration be given to alleviating the pressure on the Passport Office in Dublin by, for example, putting a printing machine in place in the Cork office? There was one there before. Such a machine could be used to serve the Munster region and beyond. This is a worthwhile proposition.</p>

          <p eId="para_430">At the weekend, the <i>Business Post</i> reported that the introduction of a vacant homes tax is in doubt. When my colleague, Deputy Cian O’Callaghan, asked the Taoiseach about this yesterday, he said that information collected by revenue related to local property tax is being analysed to assess the merits and inform the design of a vacant property tax. This seems to suggest that the Taoiseach believes the merits of a vacant homes tax are in doubt. His Fine Gael Government colleagues have been promising to introduce one since 2016. It is already six years overdue. Very simply, is the Taoiseach in favour of a vacant homes tax? Will he commit to introducing a vacant homes tax and when will that be done?</p>

          <p eId="para_431">The issue is that the Housing for All strategy includes an action for the Department of Finance to collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a vacant property tax. That has been our position. As the Deputy knows, local property tax, LPT, returns include questions such as whether a property is vacant and the reason for the vacancy if the period vacancy if the period of vacancy exceeds 12 months. The aim was to provide an indicative profile of vacant residential properties which will help to inform policy. Revenue has completed preliminary analysis of the LPT returns received to date. This has been shared with the Department of Finance. It suggests that levels of vacancy are low across all counties. Revenue will publishing a profile of the occupancy data from the LPT returns in due course.</p>

I always think of that time when front-line workers protected all of us in the context of Covid-19. It is absolutely shambolic that 2,000 medical scientists are on strike for better pay and conditions when they were at the front line in the fight against Covid-19.

          <p eId="para_434">I welcome the Government's plans to increase the amount of microgeneration of energy across the country. This is a good thing. Anything that diversifies and democratises our energy supply is something that should be incentivised and supported. Every Deputy in this Chamber is aware, however, that there has been a massive increase in energy costs, in particular electricity costs, over the past few months. However, there has not been a concurrent increase in the feed-in tariffs that energy companies are willing to pay micro-producers.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Does the Taoiseach accept that the energy companies cannot have it both ways? They cannot increase the price they are charging to consumers, while not increasing the price they are willing to pay these micro-producers.

          <p eId="para_436">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Government approved the microgeneration support scheme in December of last year. This scheme provides supports for up to 380 MW of microgeneration by 2030. To facilitate export from microgenerators, on 15 February the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications signed regulations to transpose Articles 21 and 22 of the recast renewable energy directive. These regulations place an obligation on suppliers to offer the clean export guarantee, CEG, tariff to new and existing micro and small-scale generators. Under the climate plan, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, is to complete the implementation of an interim microgeneration system and market change solution, which is on target to be completed in quarter 2 of this year. This solution will facilitate households to be remunerated by their suppliers for the excess renewable electricity they provide to the grid via the CEG tariff. The CRU published a decision on an interim and enabling framework for the CEG that outlines the arrangements for the implementation of the CEG, including eligibility criteria and the remuneration methodology. I will take the matter up further with the Minister.</p>

The Taoiseach already knows about this saga because he met the Geoghegans when he was Minister for Health. He called for a review on 1 April 2003 into the missing blood samples and then did a U-turn a month later and stopped that review. The Taoiseach had three meetings with the Geoghegans at the time and was accompanied by the then deputy chief medical officer, CMO, Dr. Tony Holohan. Was this review stopped at the behest of Dr. Holohan? The Geoghegan family has evidence that it was. They have written information which states that it was stopped by the then deputy CMO. It is 20 years later and the Geoghegans are outside the gate today protesting. Will the Taoiseach meet them and listen to them?

I spoke recently to the labour rights officer of the union, who expressed anxiety that these students are feeling especially around the accommodation issue with the ongoing housing crisis. True to form, the Department of Justice has issued a typically heartless response, saying there are no plans to further extend these visas. That is a nonsensical position to adopt.

However, some passports tend not to arrive for weeks after the specified date and many people are missing holidays as a result. I know the staff are doing their best. The other issue, which is also serious, relates to the phone lines. One could be on the phone to the Passport Office all day. Could we have a discussion on this matter?

The fact is that global action is not matching what is needed. I welcome today's debate on just transition. However, an integral part of just transition has to be climate action. When will we see the sectoral allocations relating to the climate budget? It is these allocations that will trigger a decisive shift to action? The challenge for every one of us is to make sure that in ten or 20 years’ time, we will be resilient, prosperous and competitive in a zero-carbon world. Work in that regard has to start as a matter of urgency.</p>

There will be an onus on all of us. The Deputy is correct in what he says. The carbon budgets were approved by the Houses on 6 April. The Minister and the Department are working with all other Departments, including the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Transport, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with a view to preparing a recommendation for Government approval on sectoral ceilings. We will take on board what the Committee on Environment and Climate Action has recommended but it is no longer enough to do our best; we must do what is necessary. The committee believes that the carbon budgets and the sectoral ceilings should reflect that spirit of urgency and ambition. It will be very challenging; of that there is no doubt.</p>

          <p eId="para_451">This year marks the 25th anniversary of the murder of the crusading South African journalist, Henry Nxumalo, a man whose pioneering reporting helped to document the horrors of apartheid South Africa. Nobody was ever held accountable for his death. It is obvious why Mr. Nxumalo was murdered. It is equally obvious why another apartheid regime, Israel, last week murdered the brilliant Al Jazeera journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh, as she helped to document in detail the atrocities carried out by that regime. Her protective flak jacket was marked with the word "Press" and she was standing with other journalists but she was murdered in cold blood. She joins a long list of journalists and other members of the media murdered by the Israeli military. Israel is not listening to the words of the international community. Decisive action is needed. Will the Taoiseach indicate what are the next steps in the context of holding Israel to account?</p>

          <p eId="para_452">The Irish Government has consistently raised this issue at the EU and the UN Security Council. Everybody in the House should raise the issue with those who have influence over Israel. There is increasingly institutionalised discrimination within the West Bank and the occupied territories. That is not acceptable. I hope Sinn Féin would do likewise when it meets representatives in the United States, for example. I hope it has been as strong as it is here in the context of the Palestinian question when it meets Members of the US Congress on Capitol Hill. I do not know whether the Deputy has got any feedback from her discussions with those representatives on that. The murder of Shireen Abu Akleh has to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. What happened subsequently at her funeral must also be condemned. There has been increasingly aggressive activity in the occupied territories in recent times.</p>

          <p eId="para_453">In September, an "RTÉ Investigates" programme concerning the disposal of perinatal organs at Cork University Maternity Hospital drew outrage and caused untold hurt to the families involved. These are all families who lost babies in tragic circumstances and who opted for post-mortem examinations to help them get answers to why those babies died. They signed consent forms stating that organs had to be disposed of in a sensitive manner by burial or cremation and that they would be contacted before that happened. That did not occur. It is shocking that babies' organs were disposed of along with medical waste. In the aftermath, the Minister for Health said there would be numerous reviews and that these would be conducted in a timely manner. The families involved have been told for a third time that there will be a delay in furnishing them with the report of the review team, despite the fact that it is complete. That is unacceptable. I spoke to one of the women involved on Monday and she was deeply upset by this. We need an assurance that this report will be published or given to the families as soon as possible, that there will be no further delays and that the reason for the delays is uncovered.</p>

          <p eId="para_456">As the Taoiseach is aware, the British Government has now come up with a new variation on its already despicable proposals for an amnesty for people who committed murder during the Troubles. The British Government is now proposing that those who assist a new independent recovery body and co-operate will not face prosecution. The British Government is now introducing a charter for the perpetrators of murder and other heinous crimes. We will have a coalition of murderers from the state forces and murderers from the paramilitary organisations. Yesterday at the event to mark the 48th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings where 33 innocent people were killed and hundreds injured, the Taoiseach said that the Stormont House Agreement needed to be implemented, and that we need to ensure that the rights and concerns of victims are centre stage in all processes. A very firm rebuke must go to the British Government regarding this variation on its already discredited amnesty proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_457">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue with me. We are considering the United Kingdom Government's published proposals in detail. I have no doubt that we will have a very comprehensive range of issues to raise and questions to ask. There is also a broader question of process. It has been our consistent position - I have communicated this to the British Prime Minister - that the basis for progress on legacy issues is the Stormont House Agreement that was reached between the two Governments and political parties back in 2014. If a significant unilateral departure from that agreement is now being proposed, this would need to be discussed by both Governments and with all the parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> There must be serious and credible engagement with victims and families. It is essential that both Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland have real and considered discussions on any way forward on this deeply sensitive issue. Crucially, victims and families must be brought into the consideration of any way forward. I have met many of those groups in recent months. They are not happy with the manner in which the British Government approached this and their views must be uppermost.</p>

Notwithstanding criticism from some in the House about western engagement with Afghanistan over the past 20 years or so, one of the benefits that arose was the liberation of women to a certain extent particularly with access to education and schools. The Taliban is back in charge with its very regressive views on women in general and women's access to education. I ask the Deputy to provide the details and the Minister will certainly follow through.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">I ask for an update on the status of the Protection of Employees (Collective Redundancies) Bill. Figures this week show that the administrators who looked after the sale of Debenhams in Britain made £5.3 million in fees alone. It makes you wonder how much KPMG made out of the disposal here. Workers here received a training fund after a year on the picket line and protesting. What is the status of legislative protections for workers? We need to ensure that we never again have cases such as Debenhams and Clerys. I stood with the workers from Debenhams at the gates of Leinster House last week. They know this legislation will not apply to them, but they want to ensure that what happened to them - they were treated disgracefully as the Taoiseach has acknowledged - will not happen to another group of workers. We need to progress this legislation as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_463">As the Taoiseach knows there is a chronic crisis with the cost of living at the moment, much of it brought on by the war in Ukraine and other issues. He will be aware from his party's commitments in the election of another group in society who have been suffering with the cost of living for many years, members of our Defence Forces. We have procrastinated over the commission on the review of pay for members of the Defence Forces for some considerable time. The Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and PDFORRA have gone to the European Court to secure the right to collective bargaining which they still cannot do without the permission of the Minister. When does the Government propose to address the chronic crisis for members of our understaffed by 1,000 Defence Forces? Recruiting at the moment is like trying to fill an empty bucket when these people cannot survive. There are many in my constituency and in the Taoiseach's constituency. We would like some dates and some tangible action that will be taken to address this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_464">I take the point the Deputy has raised. There are issues. There have been some adjustments in respect of some members of the Defence Forces. The Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces was established by the Government to undertake a comprehensive examination of all issues relating to our Defence Forces. That independent commission has reported. It was established within the first six months. There was widespread consultation and nearly 500 public submissions. It conducted site visits to a large number of military locations, meeting more than 1,000 Defence Forces members and their representative associations. Considerable change has been recommended. It will be coming back to Government. Parallel with that there will be an examination of the broader pay structure and the collective bargaining issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_465">Farmers are under savage pressure with the increased costs of fertiliser, fuel and electricity. I welcome the €1,000 proposed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine for 10 ha. While it is not an awful lot, it is a lot in a way. There are many farmers in east and south Kerry who do not cut their own fodder on their own land because the land is not suitable. We rely on people like Finbarr Marshall from Ballygarvan and Flor O'Brien from Kenmare to draw the fodder from other places like Cork. Will the Minister include something for those people? Will the payment be made as soon as possible because many farmers just do not have money to carry on?</p>

          <p eId="para_466">I thank the Deputy for his question. As he knows this is a challenging time for the cost of inputs, particularly fertiliser. I have been engaged closely with the fertiliser suppliers to ensure security of supply. They have worked very hard to ensure that is the case. I also introduced the scheme to pay €1,000 on up to 10 ha to support farmers to cut hay and silage this year. As the Deputy knows, we cannot do everything but we are working hard to understand the challenges there. That scheme will be a really important support to encourage farmers to grow. It applies to beef farmers, sheep farmers and those with tillage land who grow fodder. It will be paid in the latter part of the year. It is not possible to pay it in advance. Knowing that support will be there gives confidence to the sector to make preparations to grow the grass, grow the fodder and will help to cover the cost of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_468">Problems with our healthcare system predate this Government. One might expect the Government to be uniquely qualified to deal with it given that it includes three previous Ministers for Health in the Cabinet, along with, of course, the Minister for Health, and yet problems persist and get worse. The people tasked with implementing Sláintecare have resigned. The IMO is balloting for industrial action. Non-consultant hospital doctors and medical scientists are on strike today. Nowhere is the problem more manifest than in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, where overcrowding continues. I welcome that an expert team was sent in there. I called for an independent review. When will this expert team report? To whom will it report? Will its report be published? What are its terms of reference? Will it include looking at whether some of the model 2 hospitals in the region now need to be upgraded to deal with the population in the mid-west?</p>

          <p eId="para_470">There is no doubt but that there are significant pressures at UHL. Overall, despite all of the negativity around health services, the bottom line is that in the past 20 years, Ireland has moved from 16th to first in the European Union league table of life expectancy. That is due to a whole range of public health measures but it is also due to investments in our health services, including cardiology, oncology, stroke treatment and so on.</p>

Widowers, widows and guardians must produce affidavits and death certificates every time their child's passport is being renewed. It may be a reasonable position to prevent fraud etc. but I am sure the Taoiseach will agree it is excessive and upsetting when those documents must be produced every single time the passport is being renewed. The Department for Foreign Affairs website states that if one of the two guardians is deceased and no other guardian is appointed, the living guardian is the sole guardian and an original death certificate must be produced every time. Will the Taoiseach be caring and compassionate and do something about that? It is painful and traumatising for the person who is surviving to have to produce those documents on each occasion.</p>

Further laboratory analysis of affected homes in County Clare has taken place and categorically demonstrates the presence of pyrite.

It clearly warrants the immediate extension of the defective concrete blocks scheme to County Clare.

            <p eId="para_494">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on accommodation and supports for Ukrainian refugees oversees the whole-of-Government humanitarian response to supporting people from Ukraine who have sought temporary protection here.</p>
            <p eId="para_495"> In addition to the members of the Cabinet committee, the Minister for Justice also attended the meeting on 12 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_496"> To date, more than 30,000 people have arrived in Ireland fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. Emergency and short-term accommodation for these people is being provided through the international protection accommodation service, IPAS, and over 18,000 Ukrainian arrivals are currently being accommodated by the State. The support of the Irish Red Cross and many other charities and NGOs is an essential part of the national effort. The cross-Government response is ensuring that people arriving into temporary protection are provided with access to social welfare, accommodation, health and education supports as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_497"> Yesterday, Government agreed that a €400 monthly recognition payment would be made to those who provide accommodation for those fleeing the war in Ukraine to acknowledge the generosity of Irish hosts. The Cabinet committee will meet again in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_498">I thank the Taoiseach for the update. On behalf of the Labour Party, I express our solidarity with the Ukrainian people and our condemnation of the brutal Russian invasion of which there is condemnation across Ireland. I am conscious of the immense national effort and the work that has been done by many in the public service, the Irish Red Cross and local authorities around the country to support Ukrainian refugees who have come here and to address their need for accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_499"> We have engaged with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and flagged to him a large number of vacant and empty sites in Dublin and around the country. We still do not have clarity as to what the Government is planning to do to activate these empty properties, some of which are centrally located. I previously flagged Baggot Street hospital and the Avalon hostel in Aungier Street in my constituency. Another site that has been brought to my attention is that of the old Jury's Hotel in Ballsbridge, which has apparently been ear-marked for a new US embassy but with 400 bedrooms and currently lying empty. What can we do to ensure the capacity in these buildings will be brought on stream?</p>

            <p eId="para_500">If, as we must, we are going to provide refuge for those fleeing the war in Ukraine, we need to do everything we can to relieve pressure on the housing services. A simple measure I suggested to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage when he was looking for suggestions a number of weeks ago was to stop evictions, as we did during the Covid-19 emergency. The numbers of evictions are rising and that is increasing the number of people and families going into homeless services who should not be there. It is putting more and more pressure on our housing services.</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> Similarly, on the issue of vacant buildings, we wrote weeks ago suggesting specific buildings in my constituency that might be suitable.</p>
            <p eId="para_502">We have heard absolutely nothing about what the Government intends to do to put those buildings to use for those affected both by the refugee crisis and the housing crisis.</p>

            <p eId="para_503">Will the Taoiseach back the growing calls for debt relief for Ukraine? Even the US Congress has now backed calls for suspending all debt service payments by Ukraine and for debt relief. Ireland has reportedly given around €20 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine but the Ukrainians are spending 300 times that amount, or €6 billion, this year just servicing their odious debt. This means that all of our humanitarian aid amounts to less than 40 hours of servicing that debt. Unless the debt is cancelled, the money is really just going back out the door to the IMF, the World Bank and others rather than actually supporting the victims of this brutal war. We have seen for ourselves how crippling such debts can be and the impact of IMF-backed austerity. So far, however, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has said that debt forgiveness risks impairing the IMF's financial integrity, as if the IMF is about to go bankrupt, which is clearly ridiculous. Will the Taoiseach support debt relief?</p>

            <p eId="para_504">Faoin tseachtain seo, tá nach mór 6,000 leanbh ón Úcráin tar éis dul isteach inár mbunscoileanna agus meánscoile. Tá pobalscoileanna ar fud an Stáit tar éis rudaí dochreidte a dhéanamh chun cabhrú leis na leanaí seo, ag cur fáilte rompu agus ag tabhairt leabhar agus cultacha scoile dóibh.</p>
            <p eId="para_505"> While they have made incredible efforts, taking in additional students has put pressure on schools' whose resources are stretched. Many schools' budgets are already overstretched as they try to make this year's funding cover the extortionate rises in energy costs to keep the lights on. Many schools are having to reach into this limited pot of money to pay for uniforms, school supplies and books for Ukrainian children who cannot afford them. I have received responses from the Minister for Education previously about English language supports but I want to know what additional capitation funding will be provided to schools who have taken in Ukrainian children and young people, for books, equipment and so on. </p>

            <p eId="para_506">As the war inflicted by the evil regime of Mr. Putin continues in Ukraine, it is obvious from listening to contributors from Ukraine and those associated with the Ukrainian Government that there is an urgent need to continue to provide humanitarian aid and financial support. The European Union has been very responsive, as has our own Government and that help needs to be continued. I would like to take the opportunity to compliment the schools and communities throughout the country as well as our local authorities and the local development companies who have been very proactive in assisting refugees who have come to different parts of our country. Every assistance is being provided to make sure they get the proper and well-deserved welcome they need.</p>

            <p eId="para_507">I ask the Taoiseach to take the time to acknowledge the Trojan work being undertaken on behalf of the State at the City West Hotel by volunteers from the South Dublin County Volunteer Centre and by staff from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, among others. Given that our Fianna Fáil party colleagues, Billy Kelleher, MEP, and Senator Dooley, paid visits to Ukraine in recent months, could the Taoiseach outline whether the Government or any of its representatives have similar plans? Does the Taoiseach plan to travel to Kyiv to show solidarity with Ukraine?</p>

            <p eId="para_508">It is right and proper that urgent action is taken to support the victims of this war who have fled to this country. It is also right and proper that this country takes action to support other victims of the war. I want to urgently raise the case of Javid Mamedov, a Russian anti-war activist and socialist who is now in prison after being arrested for a third time for his anti-war stance. He faces a prison sentence of five to ten years. He is not alone. More than 15,000 anti-war campaigners have been detained and many are currently in prison facing charges. I ask the Taoiseach to contact the Russian Embassy urgently to demand the release of Javid Mamedov and all of those other anti-war prisoners.</p>

            <p eId="para_509">I have raised with the Taoiseach the issue of Russian money sloshing around the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC, in Dublin. A number of companies have been set up in the IFSC to facilitate the circumvention of sanctions. Journalists for <i>The Currency</i> indicate that they have tracked approximately €13 billion of Russian money, while <i>The Irish Times</i> indicated previously that there was €34 billion in opaque Russian-linked shell companies. I asked the Central Bank if it was investigating this but it said "No". The bank is not investigating it and does not have a proactive investigative role in terms of sanctions being circumvented. I asked the Minister for Justice if An Garda Síochána is investigating this but she could not tell me whether that is the case. Here we are, months after this was first raised, not just by me but by others, and we still do not know whether there is any investigation taking place into the possible circumvention of sanctions by shell companies in the IFSC.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_510">Deputy Bacik raised the issue of buildings in the medium term. We will have a look at the Jurys Hotel site and we have been examining any other sites that Deputy Bacik and others have flagged to us. The International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, has been notified of the availability for use of a range of buildings. Local authorities have identified in excess of 500 vacant buildings in their areas and to date, 89 of these buildings have been deemed capable of almost immediate occupation by up to 5,355 persons. The IPAS is conducting a further assessment of the remaining buildings and this is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_511"> The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has asked the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, to develop a proposal in respect of the establishment of an emergency vacant housing delivery unit drawing on expertise from the local government and private sectors to co-ordinate, consult on and direct the refurbishment of buildings. Exemptions from planning requirements will be determined, where necessary, on these buildings. A dedicated director of services staff member, supported by a small team, will be assigned on a full-time basis in all local authorities to co-ordinate the local response between all of the agencies and community groups engaged in support and service provision for Ukrainians.</p>
            <p eId="para_512"> The OPW will lead on the design, development and delivery of any accommodation to be produced through modular volumetric construction, including associated site-enabling works on available and suitable State land. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will establish a clearing house to address contractual, operational and compliance issues associated with planning permission which has been granted but not yet activated. Much work is going on in respect of a lot of buildings that have been identified. Quite a number of religious organisations have put forward buildings as well, including former convents and monasteries, which are in use by refugees, particularly those from Ukraine. </p>
            <p eId="para_513"> I assure Deputy Boyd Barrett that every effort is being made to prevent evictions. The Minister has taken a series of measures to try to reduce and minimise evictions but the reality is that when more than 30,000 people come into a country within three months, fleeing war and the agony and trauma of war, the response has to be different from the normal response. That is why such a significant amount of accommodation is being procured by the State. We are trying to provide sufficient and adequate accommodation for Ukrainians who have fled the war. In addition to that, the work of the Irish Red Cross on houses that have been pledged is also ongoing to provide additional support.</p>

            <p eId="para_515">The reconfiguration of buildings is important. The real issue here is to get scale and volume through existing buildings that are not being used, to get them refurbished, if necessary, and back into use.</p>
            <p eId="para_516"> In response to Deputy Paul Murphy, I met the Prime Minister of Ukraine recently at Shannon Airport but he did not ask me for a declaration of support for debt relief. He indicated to me that he was travelling to Washington to meet the IMF and various organisations to discuss how to support both the current budgetary needs of Ukraine and also the reconstruction effort in the event of the war coming to an end. I will be guided by the Ukrainian Government in respect of how it wants to progress this, working with bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">There is very strong international support for Ukraine from the G7, the European Union, the United States, Japan, Canada and many others. I have no doubt that will continue and that phase by phase throughout this war that will continue. The Prime Minister did seek some additional supports around the international aid that is flowing in, and that there would be a more proactive partnership with the Ukrainian Government on the ground in term of the deployment and disbursement of those resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_518"> Aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Laoghaire agus ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le scoileanna na tíre as an méid oibre atá déanta acu ó thaobh leanaí ón Úcráin de atá inár scoileanna anois. Tá suas le 6,000 díobh, is dócha, anois ag freastal inár scoileanna. Is iontach an scéal é sin agus caithfimid ár mbuíochas a ghabháil le húdaráis agus foirne na scoileanna, na múinteoirí, gach duine atá ag obair sna scoileanna agus na tuismitheoirí dúiche mórthimpeall. Níl aon amhras ach go mbeidh áiseanna á lorg ag na scoileanna. I dtús báire bhí sé práinneach iad a thabhairt isteach go dtí deireadh na bliana seo ó thaobh na scoileanna de ach beidh an Meán Fómhair ag teacht agus beidh gá a bheith feasach faoi sin, déileáil leis na scoileanna agus a fháil amach cad atá uathu. I mention the establishment of the schools and the challenges. I think we are looking at the next academic year. We are making certain provisions but obviously the priority was to get the students places in schools. Certainly the next academic year will be important in the context of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_519"> On Deputy Brendan Smith's question, there is absolutely an urgent need to continue with the humanitarian aid. I fully appreciate the efforts the Deputy has made, and the efforts of all those in the House, in progressing this issue. On Deputy Lahart's point, I call out and support the very strong volunteerism, in particular that which he mentioned, namely, the South Dublin County Volunteer Centre, Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and public servants in general who have responded above and beyond the call of duty since this war began and this crisis developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_520"> I also salute Senator Timmy Dooley and Billy Kelleher, MEP, for visiting Ukraine early on during the war through the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, group. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been to Kiev as well. We will consider that issue also. Again, we work with Ukrainian Government doing whatever we can to provide support.</p>
            <p eId="para_521"> I will pursue the issue raised by Deputy Barry if he could send on the details of the case to us.</p>

            <p eId="para_524"> On Deputy Tóibín's question, first of all, action will be taken against anybody circumventing the sanctions. There is a role for the Central Bank in relation to that. It has done significant analysis in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_538"> The shared island dialogues are also a key part of the Government' s approach. We have brought together more than 1,300 citizens and civic leaders so far, from across all communities, traditions and regions, to discuss how we work for a shared future on this island in practical and meaningful ways.</p>
            <p eId="para_539"> Nine shared island dialogues have been convened to date, the most recent on tourism and sport at the end February this year. Excitingly, we are now in a position to move to in-person events which I have no doubt will enrich the conversations and connectivity in the dialogues. A key focus for us this year is regional engagement. A dialogue on rural and community development is being convened this week by the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, taking place in Monaghan.</p>

We are in a cost-of -living crisis. This summer, and each summer, one of the biggest bills families are faced with is the cost of schoolbooks on return to school. Families are spending hundreds of euro on schoolbooks each year. It is a programme for Government commitment to expand the free schoolbooks scheme. We are now two years into the Government's term and, aside from a small pilot, there is no progress towards free schoolbooks. Free schoolbooks have been available in the North since 1947. We are 75 years behind, and counting. Four generations of children and young people in the North have been given access to education that might not otherwise have been accessed. This is access that our young people have been, and still are, denied. Will the Taoiseach's Government commit to rapidly expanding the free schoolbooks scheme to every school across the country?</p>

I reiterate the point that I know is shared by so many colleagues, which is our grave concern and alarm about the unilateral action the British Government is proposing to take, or indeed threatening to take, on the protocol. Its cynical attempt to describe it as a measure to protect the Good Friday Agreement will, in our view, damage the institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">We are very concerned, as I know all Deputies are, that if the British Foreign Secretary moves ahead with this naked political posturing, then it would be a breach of international law and has the potential to seriously undermine efforts to normalise the post-Brexit trade landscape on our islands. A unilateral action will not help resolve this. I should say that I spoke with the British ambassador this morning and put that view to him. I am glad to hear that formally, the British Government is saying it wants and would prefer a negotiated solution. It wants to see the Executive up and running again. Has the Taoiseach had direct engagement to ensure we reach that negotiation point and condemn utterly the unilateral action?</p>

            <p eId="para_546"> Separately, yesterday was the 48th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. I know the Taoiseach attended a ceremony to commemorate these terrible events on Talbot Street. Will he continue to press the British Government to give access to any documents in existence that would help establish the truth behind these appalling tragedies?</p>
            <p eId="para_547"> Following on from Deputy Brendan Smith earlier, what is the Taoiseach's view regarding the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill introduced by the British Government yesterday? As the Taoiseach knows, this is a revised proposal. In my view, this proposal still constitutes a de facto amnesty and is not in accordance with the Stormont House Agreement. Will the Taoiseach be conveying our concerns about this legislation to the British Government as a matter of urgency?</p>

            <p eId="para_548">People Before Profit will be facilitating a vote on the national maternity hospital tonight. We think the Government's decision to retain influence by a privately owned religious charity in the national maternity hospital is really an insult to the women of Ireland and to all those who suffered in Magdalen laundries and mother and baby homes. It also shows scant regard for the need to separate church and State as part of trying to achieve a united Ireland. How are we seriously suggesting that a united Ireland is something that will be attractive to people North and South if we do not separate church and State in terms of healthcare for women and healthcare generally and, indeed, education?</p>

            <p eId="para_549">The shared island we stand for is a secular and socialist island. An essential point of that is no involvement of the church in terms of healthcare and education. That is a very basic thing yet the Government signed an agreement and lease with St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, where the first line of the constitution literally is about the mission of Mary Aikenhead, who was the founder of the Sisters of Charity, which was responsible for the running of the Magdalen laundries, thereby completely contradicting that idea.</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> The Taoiseach was very coy earlier in response to Deputy McDonald about how he will vote tonight on a motion that goes exactly against what the Government did. The motion from Sinn Féin, which we support, states that it should be a public maternity hospital on public land and so on. The Government did the opposite of that yesterday. What is the Government position? How will the Taoiseach be voting tonight?</p>

            <p eId="para_551">One of the many benefits of the Good Friday Agreement has been the development of the all-Ireland economy. That economy has evolved without any political sloganeering, waving of flags or fanfare. I welcome the research on economic and social opportunities on an all-Ireland basis under the shared island initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_552"> The Taoiseach may recall that at the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I mentioned that within those studies, there should be a subset with particular reference to the development of enterprise in the central Border area. We need additional enterprise centres and workspace because of the huge cost for start-up businesses and small enterprises in putting appropriate infrastructure and workspace in position. Cavan and Monaghan county councils and local enterprise offices, along with their colleagues north of the Border, are putting together proposals with regard to the need for funding on a cross-Border basis to develop enterprise centres. I hope that can happen because economically, we are the most vulnerable part of the Border region and we need new industrial infrastructure.</p>

Our only hope is that the British Government is engaging in a farce it is not really too hopeful of seeing through, just to keep some of the Conservative Party happy. That is obviously not good enough, however. It gives succour to the DUP, which is in the middle of cul-de-sac politics. We really need to deal with that. What has the Taoiseach's engagement been with the British Government? Beyond that, we need to ensure that the research for the shared island unit is expanded, that we look at the potential for Irish unity, that the shared island dialogue is also expanded and we deal with the constitutional issue. That is the only thing that we need to do.</p>

            <p eId="para_555">Deputy Durkan and a number of Deputies raised the issue of the British Government decision yesterday and announcement of an intention to bring in legislation to circumvent and undermine the protocol. That is unacceptable. I made it very clear that unilateral action is not the way to progress issues pertaining to the protocol. We have always accepted that legitimate issues have been raised with regard to the protocol. We have also been very clear, and I was very clear to the British Prime Minister last week, that the European Union has made very progressive and advanced moves in respect of the protocol, particularly last October, which were not reciprocated adequately. I have asked and made the point that the only way to resolve issues pertaining to the protocol is for substantive and professional negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom Government. Those should commence without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_556"> In addition, the Assembly should be convened without delay. It is unacceptable in any democratic society that once the people have voted, the parliament for which they voted does not get established. If we think about it, it is just unacceptable that in the immediate aftermath of an election, the people cannot have their parliament convened. That should happen immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_557"> In terms of Deputy Ó Laoghaire's comments, again, we have developed our systems here. We have a free book scheme, which has been expanded, and we will continue to work on improving access to it. Our outcomes are stronger. The Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme in particular was singled out by the ESRI as particularly important. That was introduced in the early 2000s and has had a huge impact in school retention. The most recent announcement by the Minister, Deputy Foley, again copper-fastens the work that was done by the Governments in the early 2000s in respect of DEIS. The degree to which it has had an impact was clear from the ESRI report.</p>
            <p eId="para_558"> I dealt with some of Deputy Bacik's comments in terms of the British Government's approach. I will make a general point, and Deputies Haughey and Brendan Smith also raised this, that the whole basis of the Good Friday Agreement and peace process was on both Governments working together, underpinned with working with all the political parties in the North. The current British Government has digressed from that in spirit it seems to me. That is manifest in the legacy proposals and it is manifest now in terms of the protocol. Brexit created a context; the protocol was designed to try to deal with the unique situation with Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement. Issues were raised that can be resolved; I have no doubt about that. Those issue can be resolved but there needs to be a proper engagement with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, which involves both Governments working lock stock together with the political parties to achieve progress into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_559"> In terms of my attendance yesterday at the commemoration of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and Justice for the Forgotten, I pay tribute to them. We are continuing to seek access to all documents from the British Government and doing anything we can here in terms of facilitating the Operation Denton report and the work of Jon Boutcher in that regard. I have equally already articulated my concerns in terms of legacy. Again, that unilateral approach is not acceptable. I have met the victims groups and they should be uppermost in our consideration. I do not believe there should be any amnesty for anybody who committed murder in Northern Ireland or for anyone who was involved in any atrocity. All parties to atrocities should be accountable and if prosecutions can take place, they should.</p>
            <p eId="para_560"> Deputies Boyd Barrett and Paul Murphy raised the issue of the maternity hospital and brought that up in the context of a shared island.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">There is no church involvement in the new national maternity hospital. The church has divested itself from St. Vincent’s Holdings CLG, so there is no church involvement. It will be a secular hospital and all lawfully permitted services available in the State will be provided in this hospital into the future. There is full public ownership through the 300-year lease, which is not conditional, a term Deputy Bacik used earlier. The only condition on the lease is that we build a maternity hospital and maintain it-----</p>

            <p eId="para_575"> The Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality oversees implementation of the programme for Government commitments in the areas of social policy, including sport, equality, arts and culture, as well as children and youth affairs and public services, including matters relating to justice, policing reform and community safety. These commitments and other matters include poverty and disadvantage; examining area-based initiatives to build stronger communities; progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government; addressing food poverty in children and ensuring no child goes hungry; expanding the Dublin north-east inner-city model to comparable areas experiencing disadvantage; introducing a scheme to regularise undocumented migrants, which was announced last December and is currently open for applications; advancing proposals to deal effectively with the issue of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence through a third national strategy; ending the direct provision system and replacing it with a new international protection accommodation policy; extending paid parental leave, allowing parents to spend more time with their baby during his or her first year; establishing Childcare Ireland to assist the sector in delivering high-quality childcare; legislating to require publication of the gender pay gap in large companies; responding to the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality; publishing a new national action plan against racism; progressing implementation of A Policing Service for our Future, including more visible community policing; introducing a new policing and community safety Bill to redefine the functions of An Garda Síochána; and introducing hate crime legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_577">In the last few weeks, I have been contacted by scores of parents who cannot find a childcare place in Cork, and it is one of the biggest issues coming into my constituency office and across the State. When I contacted Tusla to try to get a scope of the issue, it was no wonder parents were finding it difficult. The agency told me 73 childcare services had closed in the past five years in Cork city and county and that there are 384 fewer childcare places in the city than five years ago. When families do find a place in a crèche, they face fees of €800, or often more than €1,000, for just one child, while for two or three children the figure will be well in excess of that. Meeting these costs is a huge weight on families' backs that is holding back parents and predominantly women in their careers. The childcare sector in Cork is haemorrhaging highly qualified childcare professionals because they have been treated so badly by successive Governments, working for little more than the minimum wage.</p>
            <p eId="para_578"> The Taoiseach's Government needs to address this issue urgently to upscale the supply of affordable childcare.</p>

            <p eId="para_579">Childcare is a massive issue for parents in every constituency. Ireland has some of the most expensive childcare costs in Europe and we need clarity on how it is proposed to reduce fees for parents, to improve pay and conditions for staff and to improve the availability of places for children. In Limerick on Monday, I visited two brilliant childcare and early years education services, namely, Northside Family Resource Centre and Our Lady of Lourdes Childworld in Rosbrien. I was asked whether the Government's new funding model will build in recognition of places offering early childhood care and education in disadvantaged settings and whether there will be a delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, style mechanism for childcare settings where there are added needs and where additional resources may be required. In principle, we need to see rapid action on this from the Government because there is so little availability of childcare places and so many parents are struggling with the fees.</p>

            <p eId="para_580">I raise a financial issue. As the Taoiseach will know, on 1 May, Carlow became a university town and county and the south east got a technological university, but that brings many challenges. Carlow County Council has applied for €12 million in funding for a project to extend the library in Carlow because we need the services. The library is too small and is inadequate for the expanding services now that university status has been awarded. We have received stage 2 approval and we have proceeded to stage 3. Carlow County Council has a “cultural quarter” in the town centre, which includes Carlow College which is to be integrated into the technological university, and the expansion of the library with this new project. The capital funding for the library for this year is gone, as I understand it, but a new strategy for capital library projects is going to be announced by the end of the year. For regional development and finance for Carlow and because we are doing so well, I ask the Taoiseach to look at this favourably.</p>

            <p eId="para_581">The Taoiseach is familiar with the case of Pat and Nuala Geoghegan, who have for more than 25 years been highlighting serious concerns about the health and environmental impacts of the Aughinish Alumina plant neighbouring their farm. They have raised serious questions over a previous investigation into this in the late 1990s, in particular highlighting 18 medical samples that mysteriously disappeared.</p>
            <p eId="para_582"> I have copies of a previously unpublished letter from the IDA and of notes from a previous meeting the agency had with Aughinish over this. They clearly show that the IDA, with absolutely no environmental or health expertise, not only took Aughinish’s side but sought to influence the outcome of the health investigation. They refer to the importance of the jobs involved and restate the IDA had been assured by the company that there was nothing to see there. I have a letter showing these notes were circulated to those conducting the investigation into the health problems despite it containing no scientific or health information, clearly an attempt to use economic arguments to influence the health investigation and to bias the whole thing.</p>

Whether it is rents gone out of control, childcare costs, college fees, the cost of food items or heating and energy costs, they believe, and I think they are right, that the Government has not done enough to control the cost of living or deal with the profiteering by landlords and energy companies.

I am new to this case and have been reading up on it only over recent days, and it is clear the public interest has not been served by the investigations into the missing samples, the freedom of information documentation that confirms those samples had been tested, and the question as to who, what, when and why those samples and the subsequent results went missing. The Taoiseach was intimately involved in this case as Minister for Health and Children.

            <p eId="para_586">I thank the Deputies for raising these issues. Deputy Ó Laoghaire asked about the issue of childcare. In the last budget, very significant additional funding was allocated for childcare with a focus on enhancing pay and conditions for those working in the area. Discussions are to take place between employers in the childcare area and representatives of workers with a view to reaching a joint labour committee agreement. My understanding is that September is the deadline for that but I can double-check the timelines. The allocation in the budget for the latter part of this year and the full year of 2023 was very substantial because there is no question but that childcare is a big issue for many people. The costs are very significant and place great pressure on many young families. There is also the issue of retaining people in the childcare sector and encouraging people to pursue career pathways in that field. That is why the Minister took the decision to seek resources in the last budget round in respect of the career pathway aspect, conditions and making the situation more attractive for those working in childcare.</p>
            <p eId="para_587"> Deputy Bacik raised the same issue although she added a point on specific offerings for disadvantaged areas. I will discuss that with the Minister. There are already some provisions in that respect but a DEIS-type approach to childcare in disadvantaged areas is something that we could pursue and which could support communities. We already offer significant support but we will certainly examine the Deputy's proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_588"> On Deputy Murnane O'Connor's point, these are exciting times in Carlow, particularly with regard to the decision that the grounds of Carlow College can be made available to South East Technological University. That is significant. The Deputy's more immediate request related to Carlow County Council's application for a new county library, costing around €12 million. This is progressing. It is on stage 3. I will engage with the Minister in that regard because a modern library would be worthwhile infrastructure for the general population of Carlow and not just because of what is transpiring at third level.</p>
            <p eId="para_589"> On the Aughinish Alumina plant and the campaign of Pat and Nuala Geoghegan, I have not gone over all of the documentation recently but, if my recollection is correct, there was significant work by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. I do not have the documents Deputy Paul Murphy says he has with regard to the Industrial Development Authority, IDA Ireland. The issue was examined from a health perspective and by the EPA at the time. These are issues that should be examined by independent agencies with expertise and competency in the field. That campaign has been going on for a long time and there have been quite a number of reports and reviews.</p>
            <p eId="para_590"> Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about the cost of living. The Government has responded to the cost-of-living issue in a very significant way. I do not agree with the Deputy's analysis of the Government's response. More than €2 billion has now been provided if you take into account both the budget and more recent efforts. We hiked the weekly fuel allowance and paid an additional lump sum of €125 in March. A further special payment of €100 will be paid to 370,000 households in receipt of the fuel allowance. As a result, the fuel allowance paid in the full season from 2021 to 2022 totals €1,139, an increase of €404 or 55% on the previous year. We have reduced the excise duty on petrol, diesel and green diesel until mid-October, saving motorists between €9 and €12 each time they fill their tank. We have reduced VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills until the end of October resulting in estimated annual savings for households of €50 and €70 respectively. We have given households a €200 energy credit and will cut the annual public service obligation levy of €58 to zero by October 2022. We have launched a national retrofitting scheme that provides free energy upgrades for those at risk of energy poverty. We have introduced new grant rates that will cover approximately 80% of the typical cost of attic and wall insulation. We have reduced caps on school transport fees for multiple children and cut public transport by 20%, with an additional 50% cut in fares for young people. We have lowered the threshold for the drugs payment scheme to €80 per month, benefiting more than 17,000 families. We have brought forward the working family payment increase announced on budget day from 1 June to 1 April. We have agreed to abolish the inpatient charge of €80 per night for all children. We have capped annual rent increases at 2% and launched a cost-rental scheme with homes available at 40% to 50% below market rents. We have also introduced significant support packages for the hospitality industry, including the 9% VAT rate, and for the haulage and tillage sectors. I could go on. Significant efforts have been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_591"> Deputy Carthy raised a similar issue to that raised by Deputy Paul Murphy in respect of Askeaton. As I have said, there have been a number of reports and reviews and these can be re-examined but that is the position as it stands today.</p>

        <speech by="#OssianSmyth" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Climate_and_Communications" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_592">I thank Deputies for providing me with this opportunity to update them on the plans of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in regard to a just transition. Ireland is committed to achieving a just transition while ensuring nobody is left behind as we move to a climate-neutral economy and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> The climate action plan 2021 places a just transition at its core. The plan sets out four principles that will guide policymaking and implementation over the coming years to ensure we can effectively monitor and manage our transition and that our responses remain flexible in order to respond to future transition challenges and target the areas in need of support. The first of the four just transition principles is that we pursue an integrated, structured and evidence-based approach to identifying and planning our response to just climate transition requirements. The second principle is that people are equipped with the right skills to be able to participate in, and benefit from, the future net-zero economy. Third, costs will be shared in order that the impact is equitable and existing inequalities are not exacerbated. The fourth principle is that we place social dialogue at the heart of our climate policy to ensure impacted citizens and communities are empowered and are core to the transition process.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> The climate action plan sets out that each Minister should approach the development and implementation of climate policies within his or her sector in line with these principles. We will also be accountable in regard to how we proceed. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 gave the Oireachtas the power to scrutinise our progress and it is right that this scrutiny should extend to how we are implementing our just transition principles. A shared understanding between Government and affected parties in this transition will be necessary to plan policy accordingly. In light of this, the Government has also implemented a refreshed national dialogue on climate action, NDCA, that will have just transition at its core. The NDCA will be the key mechanism for facilitating the social dialogue process as part of the transition. This will consist of awareness-raising, communications and activation. It will ensure community engagement and participation takes place at sectoral, local, regional and national levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> The Government has also committed to establishing a statutory just transition commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">It is envisaged that the commission will support Government policy development in this area with specific objectives relating to: first, monitoring progress on the implementation of the just transition framework and preparing reports and recommendations to the Government and the Oireachtas; second, commissioning research and identifying research needed in respect of a just transition to facilitate evidence-based decision-making across Government regarding a just transition; and third, providing advice and support to the Minister and the Government on stakeholder participation and dialogue in a manner that effectively integrates just transition considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> Taking each of these in turn, it is essential that the Government has access to high-quality independent advice on the steps it should take to deliver a just transition, in line with the framework set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021. This advice should be evidence-based and it should be grounded in the day-to-day reality faced by individuals and communities. It is also important that the commission provides the Oireachtas with a trusted source of information and advice to assist it in its role in holding Ministers to account. Building on this, the commission should be able to set the agenda for research into current and future needs and challenges relating to just transition. This anticipatory or foresight role is essential, given that the climate ambitions the Oireachtas has set for Ireland through the 2021 climate legislation extend to 2050. Stakeholder participation and dialogue have repeatedly been shown to be a key ingredient to promote a just transition. The work of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, in this area has found that co-designing inclusive, focused and participatory engagement processes with those most impacted at an early stage is key to ensuring that a transition is just.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> The national dialogue on climate action is the key mechanism the Government will deploy to facilitate the social dialogue process as part of the just transition. The proposed commission is likely to have an important role to play in advising the Government and public, private and third sector actors throughout our society on best practice in dialogue and engagement for a just transition. The Minister is currently developing the mandate for the commission and this will be brought forward to the Government for its consideration by the middle of this year, in line with the timeframe set out in the climate action plan. To support the delivery of this work, and building on the work that he has already undertaken as just transition commissioner in the midlands region, the Minister has asked Mr. Kieran Mulvey to support him in the development of the mandate for the new just transition commission through undertaking stakeholder engagement relating to the mandate of the proposed commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> The midlands region is the first in Ireland to directly experience the negative impacts of the transition away from fossil fuels, with the end of peat extraction for power generation. The Government has dedicated significant funding to support workers, companies and communities affected by the closure of the peat-fired power stations and the ending of peat extraction by Bord na Móna. The just transition commissioner has made an important contribution to the Government's overall response in the midlands region, helping to facilitate dialogue and bringing forward concerns from affected communities, residents, workers and businesses. The commissioner has produced four progress reports. The recommendations they contain have been addressed by the Government through the midlands implementation plan, which is detailed in the Climate Action Plan 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> The national just transition fund, launched in 2020, is supporting projects across the wider midlands region that will have significant employment and enterprise potential and will support the transition of the region towards a low-carbon economy. The fund is supporting projects from a diversity of sources, including: from communities, local authorities and the private sector, in the areas of business development; education, training and upskilling; development of co-working and enterprise hubs; renewable energies and retrofitting; tourism, heritage and recreation; community development and capacity building; greenways and walking. Collectively, these projects will support the midlands in the transition to a low-carbon society not only by job creation but also by creating a more resilient, diverse and innovative region. The total value of the 55 projects that have been approved is €30 million, with €20.5 million of this being provided in grants through the just transition fund. It is estimated by the projects that this will lead to the creation of an estimated 154 direct jobs as well as 932 indirect jobs throughout the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> In addition to the just transition fund, the Government has also committed to invest up to €108 million in the enhanced decommissioning, rehabilitation and restoration scheme, which will create over 300 jobs and will be delivered by Bord na Móna to rehabilitate 33,000 ha over 80 separate Bord na Móna bogs. In 2021, the first year of this project, 19 rehabilitation plans were approved, with works commenced on 18 bogs. Plans for the 2022 campaign on a further 21 bogs in the midlands region are well advanced. Furthermore, the Government continues to deliver the midlands retrofitting programme and the deeper energy efficiency retrofit programme, both of which continue to support the development of warmer, easier-to-heat and more comfortable homes, enhancing air quality and providing savings on energy bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> Looking to the future, Ireland has been successful in securing €84.5 million from the new EU Just Transition Fund for investment in the longer-term transition of the midlands region over the coming decade. This EU funding will be complemented by Exchequer funding. The EU Just Transition Fund is specifically designed to address the adverse effects of the climate transition in carbon intensive regions across the European Union by supporting regions to work towards balanced socioeconomic transition to a low-carbon economy. The Department is preparing a territorial just transition plan to enable us to access the EU Just Transition Fund. This will set out the development needs of the territory to be supported and the types of activities to be supported under this new fund. The Department undertook a public consultation on the draft territorial plan earlier this year. A summary report of responses and written submissions received have been published on the Department’s website. These submissions are being reviewed to further develop and finalise the draft territorial just transition plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> The draft territorial plan identifies four key development needs for the midlands region: modernising the business environment and creating employment; enhancing the skills profile; environmental sustainability and industrial heritage; enhancing the regional profile. In recognition of the specific regional focus of this new fund, the Minister has appointed the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, EMRA, as the managing authority for the fund in Ireland. Working closely with the Department, EMRA will have a central role in the development and implementation of the programme of expenditure under the just transition fund over the coming decade. Once approved by the Government, the plan, together with the associated EU Just Transition Fund programme, will be submitted to the European Commission for approval during the course of 2022. Expenditure under the programme will commence once approved by the European Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> The programme of Exchequer supports already committed to the midlands, together with the significant additional funding that will become available over the coming decade, aims to assist the region in its just transition in order to create a climate-resilient, economically prosperous and environmentally sustainable region. It aims to deliver capacity and to generate and share solutions and knowledge in support of Ireland’s overall ambition to move towards a climate-neutral economy. Furthermore, lessons from our experience in implementing a just transition in the midlands will be invaluable in shaping and informing the development of policy on the matter into the future as we continue on our journey to integrate just transition principles across all sectors and areas of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> It is great to hear a baby in the Visitors Gallery. It is a reminder to all of us that we are discussing the climate change challenge and the just transition for the sake of young people, and that baby will be experiencing things long after we are gone. That is why we are here. I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies.</p>

        <speech by="#DarrenORourke" eId="spk_252">
          <from>Deputy Darren O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_606">I welcome these statements. They take place on the day of the publication of another major report outlining the damage global warming is doing to our planet and all its inhabitants. The State of the Global Climate report from the World Meteorological Organization, WMO, shows that the four key climate change indicators - greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, ocean heat and ocean acidification - broke records in 2021. The WMO said this is another clear sign that human activities are causing planetary scale changes with long-lasting ramifications for sustainable development and ecosystems. The findings and statistics in this report and the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, findings will come as no shock to most, as the science has been clear for decades. What has been missing, however, is action. We know what needs to be done and we know how to do it. What we need now is the Government to lead and deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> There will be no transition without a just transition. That is a matter of fact. A just transition is a critical component of climate action.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">A just transition means the bringing together of workers, communities, employers and the Government in social dialogue in order to drive the concrete plans, policies and investments needed for a fast and fair transformation to a low-carbon economy and to ensure that employment and jobs in the new economy are as decent and well-paid as those left behind. I wish to raise concerns, first, with the timelines, but also with the narrow scope of what the Government means by a just transition, which seems to be limited to the midlands. It certainly needs to apply there, but it also needs to apply in the broadest sense to everybody who is involved in this transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> We discussed the importance of a just transition and climate justice at length during the extensive debates on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. During those debates, Sinn Féin and others brought forward amendments that would have defined what constitutes a just transition in the Act and ensured that the climate action plans were drafted with reference to just transition principles. The Government rejected all amendments tabled on Committee Stage and Report Stage however, and, as a result, the Act and the climate policies flowing from it are weaker because they fail to meet the bar of equity and fairness. They fail to deliver a just transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> Retrofitting is one such policy area that is failing the just transition equity test. Sinn Féin agrees that we need to retrofit the housing stock to reduce emissions and energy use, but where we disagree is how the Government is approaching it. The Minister has introduced a new scheme this year, which prioritises ability to pay over need. If someone is fortunate enough to have €25,000 available, he or she can now get a grant of €25,000 to retrofit their home, regardless of whether the financial help is needed. I am sure the Minister of State will tell us this is balanced out by the free energy upgrades for others, but what he fails to mention is the 8,000 homes already on the growing waiting list and a delay of 27 months to get works done. The target of completing 400 homes a month is still not being achieved, despite what has been claimed by some. Under the new plan, those who have money are generously supported to get a warmer home sooner. They are at the top of the list. For every euro in carbon tax they pay, they are getting a very good return. People who qualify for the free energy upgrade must sit tight for two years or more. Someone might get to them eventually. All the while they will pay more in carbon tax to heat their homes. They will get some return on the carbon tax, but it will be slow and in the vast majority of cases the retrofits are not deep retrofits. However, renters or those on a low income who earn too much to qualify for the free scheme but not enough to afford works themselves, like very many people, are out of luck. Such people will get no return on their carbon tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> The national retrofit scheme is devoid of equity. It is benefiting those with means over those in need, and was not designed with a just transition in mind. There is a better, fairer way. We could start with the national social housing stock. We could identify those living in fuel poverty or reliant on solid fuels and start with them. We could put an income cap in place to ensure more money can be targeted at those who need it most. There are options in this area, but the Government is choosing not to take them. It is a long way off a just transition, but at the very least we should make sure that this transition does not drive people into poverty or further into poverty. The Government is failing to do that. It is just transition, it is not just stop being poor transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> It is not just the retrofitting policy that fails the test, it is the same when it comes to electric vehicle grants. People with the money to buy a brand-new €50,000 car can get a €5,000 grant and €5,000 off the vehicle registration tax, VRT. They will also get a home charger grant, cheaper motor tax and reduced tolls. That is a very good return on their carbon tax. If, like most, however, you are unable to afford a new car, there is nothing for you except higher prices at the forecourts due to the ever-increasing costs. Similarly, PAYE workers can get a significant discount on a bicycle or an e-bike, but there is nothing for students, the self-employed or unemployed. To state it clearly again, Sinn Féin agrees with retrofitting. We agree with the need for electric vehicles. We agree with the need to get more people cycling and involved in active travel, but we want to see fairer policies that will deliver these measures while prioritising those most in need. We need an approach encompassing a just transition. The Government's alternative is driving a wedge between people. It is leaving people behind and in the only measure that matter, emissions reductions, it is failing miserably.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> The Minister will have received correspondence in advance of this debate from the Just Transition Alliance. This alliance includes the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, TASC, SIPTU, Fórsa, Friends of the Earth and others. They have called for the establishment of a national just transition commission, in advance of formal legislation at the end of the year, based on social dialogue and comprised of representatives of the Government, trade unions, employers, affected communities and civil society. The commission would focus on job retention; the protection of living standards; skills development; the creation of decent work in respect of new employment opportunities; the prioritisation of the most vulnerable regions and sectors; and would be underpinned by a commitment to genuine community and regional development. Sinn Féin supports this call. I hope the Minister of State can update us on this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> The transition to a zero-carbon society and economy does not have to be punitive or achieved through eco-austerity. The framing is completely wrong. This transition should transform and improve the lives of millions in this country by means of warmer homes, cleaner air, shorter commutes, cheaper electricity and greener spaces. Unfortunately, this Government's approach means that most people just see cost. They see hypocrisy when it comes to data centres, and they see unfairness when it comes to policies. We need to invest in public transport; build good quality public housing; invest in wind and solar renewable energy; undertake a truly ambitious afforestation programme; and retrofit our national housing stock, starting with those in need, not those with ability to pay. A just transition should be at the heart of all Government policies, and it is conspicuous by its absence at the moment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MattCarthy" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_615">From what the Minister of State said, it is clear that the phrase "just transition" has virtually no meaning under this Government. There is nothing just about the course it is pursuing, nor is there much evidence that Government policies are leading to a transition at the pace required. In the area I follow closest, agriculture, Government policy has been exposed as a fallacy. While always quick and eager to impose penalties and additional charges on family farmers in rural communities, these are never matched with the provision of alternatives. In effect, the Government charges people for not using alternatives that are available to them. We hear that the receipts from carbon taxes are ring-fenced for transition measures, but that is simply not true. It is claimed, for example, that farmers will receive €120 million annually from the carbon tax towards agri-environmental schemes, but that is disingenuous in the extreme. The funding does not even replace the moneys for farmers the Government parties gave away in the EU budget negotiations. It is incorporated into the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget, despite assurances that it would be additional. Basically, farmers will receive fewer supports while being asked to do more. Then we hear Fianna Fáil Deputies and other trying to sell that as a success.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> In the areas where the interests of farming and climate action collide, the Government fails at every single turn. Organic farming, for example, presents a unique opportunity to support family farm incomes through pursuing a premiumisation model in a way that completely aligns with our environmental ambition, but this Government has set an abysmal target of 7.5% organic conversion, as against an EU target of 25%, and under a Green Party Minister of State, we are nowhere near reaching even that meagre target. Likewise in forestry, a sector where we could be making a significant impact on carbon sequestration, we have an unmitigated disaster. Rather than the delivery of a forestry policy that supports the environment, local communities and the timber industry, this Government has overseen a scenario where all three have failed. It is the same story in areas where farmers can take a lead in renewable energy provision, such as in solar and anaerobic digestion. Blockages and barriers are the order of the day. Nowhere within the Government's agriculture policy can we point to a provision that could in any way be described as pursuing a just transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> What is required to secure the future of our family farms is a fair CAP, fair prices and fair play. The delivery of these principles are also central to a just transition if that term is to have any basis in the language we use. Government parties continue to pursue the penalisation model, hiking charges on fuel and energy, but doing virtually nothing to allow those who bear the brunt to source alternatives. Through its retrofitting and electric vehicle grants policy the Government is essentially providing for a further transfer of wealth from those who are struggling the most to those who are financially better off. It is a twisted policy that bears no semblance to what a just transition should actually look like. Let us recall that the parties of Government have never achieved a single climate target that they have set.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Rather than delivering on climate action, it further frustrates, angers and alienates those who could, should and want to play a positive role in protecting our environment, biodiversity and air and water quality. The Minister of State needs to change direction or he will again fail to deliver the change that is required.</p>

        <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_254">
          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_619">I want to outline to the Minister of State why the Minister, his party leader, is so deeply unpopular in rural Ireland and why he is so out of touch with rural Ireland. I want to describe to him the practical realities for people in Donegal. We have a situation whereby two thirds of homeowners in Donegal rely on home heating oil to heat their homes. Even more rely on solid fuel. They heavily rely on these two sources of fuel to heat their homes, particularly in winter. Despite the price of home heating oil increasing by 130%, something that has had a major impact on families in our county and across the west of Ireland, not a single cent worth of help was provided by the Government. Incredibly, the Government instead increased the carbon tax even further this month. Nothing was done to help those families. There are no supports available to help them retrofit their homes. They will have to take out further loans, unless they are lucky enough to have tens of thousands of euro in their savings accounts. There is nothing of real substance at all to help families to heat their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Let us look at people who have to work and study in Donegal. The public transport system there is not fit for purpose. It has been under-resourced for years. It is not designed to connect workers with their workplaces. As a result, they have to have cars. Almost everybody who wants to work in Donegal must have a car. Everybody who wants to study in Donegal must also have a car.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Time and again I have submitted parliamentary questions to the Green Party leader, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, to ask about electric charging infrastructure in Donegal. There was no urgency. There is nothing being done. If you are a homeowner who needs to heat your home or if you are a motorist who has to have a car filled with petrol or diesel to get by, you do not have alternatives in Donegal, unless you are very wealthy. What does the Government do for these people? It does not give them the carrot; it gives them the stick, every single time. It hits them with a carbon tax again and again and again. It punishes them for choices that they do not have. It punishes them for choices that they do not have. That is why there is anger. That is why turf was merely the straw that broke the camel’s back. People had enough of the indifference to their plight and the indifference to the reality that they face every day. If the Minister of State wants to know why there is this anger towards the leader of the Green Party and the Minister, that is why. The Minister is totally disconnected and totally out of touch with the reality of people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> The Just Transition Alliance is telling the Green Party that it has not put in place a just transition commission. It is not in place. It has no dialogue with the social partners. It has no dialogue with the unions that represent the workers. The Green Party lectures people in rural Ireland about their responsibilities, but it never meets its own. It never meets its own. That is why there is such anger in places like Donegal. It will only grow more and more until the Green Party starts to listen to them and stands by them, rather than giving them the stick every time.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">The annual State of the Global Climate report provides another damning indictment of our failure to adequately respond to and tackle climate change. Four indicators broke records last year, namely, ocean heat, ocean acidification, greenhouse gas concentrations and sea level rises. We are out of time. We are out of time. However, if we want to avert further damage, we need a just transition that takes people with us. We needed it a long time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> When the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 was passing through the Houses, there was extensive debate on the amendments proposed by the Opposition to strengthen and define exactly what a just transition would mean. Unfortunately, the Minister did not incorporate this principle into the Bill. A just transition is a concept that originates from within the global trade union movement and is central to a labour and social solidarity understanding of climate protection measures. Our transition to decarbonisation must be carried out in a fair and just way that will not adversely impact on those who are most affected by the cost-of-living and energy crises.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> When I speak of a just transition, I mean the protection and creation of jobs, improved living standards and reduced emissions, protecting our biodiversity and generating new sustainable communities. We need a blueprint for the future and a structured dialogue that is inclusive of all stakeholders. We must ensure that investment to address our climate emissions and to meet our targets takes account of the need to bring people with us and to protect employment and communities. We need a flexible and accessible skills and education system to meet the needs of a net-zero economy and to address inequalities where transitions are occurring. As I said before, improving energy efficiency of the housing stock is an opportunity to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> Investment to restore peatlands, urban tree planting and woodland management are all ways in which we can action a just transition and ensure that communities are not hit in terms of employment opportunities. The recent controversy regarding turf is a prime example of the work that is needed to deliver a real just transition by addressing energy and security and protecting our bogs. The Labour Party has called for works in the context of retrofitting and energy efficiency measures for those homes that rely on sod turf to be accelerated. That will require financial investment through grant aid. There is no point in telling anyone who cannot afford to upgrade their home or to buy alternative fuels that they must change. The State needs to support them.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> The Labour Party is in full support of the Just Transition Alliance and of its call for the urgent and immediate establishment of a national commission. Indeed, this is one of the first issues that was raised with the Taoiseach by Deputy Bacik when she became leader of the Labour Party. Apart from informing us of the extension of the contract of the current just transition commissioner until the end of the year, the Taoiseach did not shed any further light on when the commission will be established. What we need to see now is a date for the establishment of the just transition commission and the mandate of the of the commission. It must incorporate International Labour Organisation guidelines and must align with the UN sustainable development goals.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> When the commission is fully established, we hope the Minister will use the experience gained in other jurisdictions, such as Scotland, Canada, Germany, Spain and New Zealand, to inform its work. The publication of detailed investment proposals and an action plans to deliver projects is necessary. Achieving that will require additional financing. In its most recent budget proposals, the Labour Party called for a doubling of the just transition fund and for increased investment in retrofitting. The midlands is not the only community at risk. We need a more ambitious response from the State. Accountability, implementation targets and transparency on decision-making must be central to the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> The question of preserving intergenerational solidarity will also be critical to its proposed work, because a younger generation is growing frustrated with the failure of those in charge to address the climate crisis. In Ireland, we have a problem with rising emissions and our emissions are going in the wrong direction. We cannot adequately plan for a just transition without the publication of sectoral emissions ceilings. The Minister of State might confirm when those will be published. We face immense challenges in the areas of transport, agriculture, food production, afforestation and electricity generation, to name just a few. We need to see those ceilings and to get to grips with the challenge. Crucially, we need the State to play a leading role in the energy sector. Why are we not directly financing offshore wind through the ESB and through other semi-States to retain those natural assets in public ownership?</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> I want to conclude on a point at that the Labour Party has made before. Our natural environment has suffered for too long from the impact of unregulated free markets and untrammelled economic growth. We must build an economic and class analysis into our response to the climate crisis, so that we do not see environmental policies in a silo. These cannot exist in a vacuum. We need a State that leads the charge on climate justice, developing a new model of climate-neutral growth through a just transition. That is why we need the commission now. Our economic planning and climate response must be in sync. These are two sides of the same coin. We need a new economy that generates wealth and that also supports emissions reduction. When my colleague, Deputy Bacik, became leader of the Labour Party, she said that in the coming months we will publish a new strategic economic plan for Ireland. It will put a clear emphasis on regional job creation and on a just transition.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe O'Brien<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_632">I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on just transition. It is an area I have a deep interest in. My ministerial responsibilities span two Departments to play a key role in ensuring a just transition. There is significant overlap and opportunity in what we need to do to decarbonise our society and make it fairer, more just and more equal. Current cost-of-living issues highlight this fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> Almost by definition, expansion of public transport and active travel options help to level the playing field when we speak of inequality in Ireland. For the first time in 40 years, we have had a reduction in public transport fares; by 20% until the end of the year and by 50% for young adults. We are only getting started on our plans for active travel and public transport. I have to acknowledge the fact this week is national bike week. We have started what needs to be a major shift towards cycling. In particular, I will mention the enormous potential of electric bikes to replace car journeys. As Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, it is important to mark the scope of the electric bike in urban areas but very much in rural Ireland too.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> I will reference a project funded by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Transport that is a key example of the way forward for a just transition. Last week, with Deputy Ó Cathasaigh, I visited a social enterprise in Waterford, Renew Enterprises, which is run by ex-prisoners who upcycle and repair old bikes and electric bikes, prevent them from going to landfill and sell them cheaply or gift them to those in need. At the same time, these workers are learning transferable bike repair skills. This is a very good example of a grassroots community-led project that intertwines social inclusion and decarbonisation at a local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> I will go from the local to the very high macro level when I talk about just transition. A move to a low-carbon society and economy will give us the capacity to fully and truly realise the values of a republic that prioritises equality of outcome for all. This can be done by transforming the orientation of our economy to become a large net exporter of renewable energy. Over time, this will allow us to frame and resource the institutions of the State to fulfil that vision of equality of outcome for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> I oversee the roadmap for social inclusion. The roadmap sets out two overarching ways to tackle social exclusion and poverty: investment in and improvement of public services; and improvements in income, either by increased employment or social transfers. The roadmap will be reviewed this year to better reflect the post-Covid realities and a programme for Government that has a strong emphasis on a just transition. These tracks of improved public services and better incomes will be better achieved in an economy that owns and exports its energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> I will make an important point about carbon tax. This Government, and the Department of Social Protection in particular, has ensured that the net impact of carbon tax increases has been to redistribute resources to the poorest in society. It may not suit other narratives but it is being used as a progressive income redistribution tool, not to mention how it funds the national retrofitting programme, which will grow to being a central pillar of just transition in Ireland by putting increased resourcing into those most at risk of fuel poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> I will touch briefly on some other areas of responsibility in the Department of Rural and Community Development. One of the best ways to ensure a just transition is to listen to, be led by and support grassroots community groups. I am glad to say the new climate Act places an obligation on local authorities to consult with public participation networks in the development of local climate action plans. I recently launched a number of pilots that are aimed at improving the quality of consultation with groups that represent marginalised people. I oversee the national social inclusion and community activation programme. This is, in essence, a team of 600 community workers throughout the country who are supporting individuals and community groups in areas of disadvantage. Again, at a very local level and with the support of the social inclusion and community activation programme, communities are developing projects that intertwine social inclusion and decarbonisation, for example, by helping to develop sustainable energy communities, by providing and maintaining community gardens and allotments, and by raising awareness of climate change. I am particularly struck of late by local development companies that are supporting community transport initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> An economy that controls and sells its own energy, continued progressive redistribution of wealth, a sea change in the use of public transport and active travel, a retrofitting programme that reaches those most in need and communities around the country taking the lead and interweaving social inclusion and decarbonisation measures will ensure a just transition. </p>

          <p eId="para_640">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It is a conversation we will need to rehearse over and again in the coming years and decades. A just transition has at its core the principle of solidarity so that, as we make changes to our economy and society in response to the existential implications of climate change and biodiversity breakdown, we protect our most vulnerable. That must be in terms of both climate mitigation and climate adaptation to include those impacted by the structural changes we must undertake in our economies, but also those directly and adversely impacted by changes in our planet’s climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> We must also be clear that a just transition is a framework to enable us as a society to make difficult decisions in the fairest possible way. It is not, and I have heard it deployed in this way, a reason or an excuse to defer, delay or deny difficult decisions. A failure to act and a business-as-usual model will be catastrophic for our entire biosphere but those impacts will be felt earliest and most keenly by those who have contributed least to the problem. They are feeling it already. From east Africa to India, the impacts of a changing climate are already playing out before our eyes.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> It is this international dimension I will concentrate on. Other Deputies will concentrate on the Irish context and that is a critical discussion to have. There are important and difficult conversations to be had about how we protect people in energy poverty, and how we reform our food systems, our transport systems and our energy systems. A just transition has to be the underpinning framework for those conversations. Our commitments under the Paris Agreement, however, are global in nature. As was restated in the Silesia declaration on solidarity and just transition in 2018:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_643">..natural disasters and other exogenous shocks, exacerbated by climate change, bring devastating effects to vulnerable workers and people living in poverty with limited savings and no social safety net, increasing the challenges ... and the obstacles to just transition, especially for countries characterized by fragile environmental conditions and least developed countries</p>
          <p eId="para_644">In preparing for today’s debate, I read the European Community Humanitarian Office crisis report to the European Commission on drought in the Horn of Africa, where climate is changing and rains are failing. In Kenya, more than 1 million livestock have perished. In Ethiopia, women and girls walk for most of the day and part of the night for a jerrycan of water. In Somalia, 1.4 million children under the age of five will face acute malnutrition through the end of the year. Do these Somali children feel hunger any less keenly than my five-year-old at home? Do Somali fathers love their children any less than I love mine? I very much doubt that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> The people of east Africa need rain and grain, not beef, butter and powdered milk. People across the developing world need a voice in any conversation on a just transition. They need Ireland, as a developed country, to live up to our climate commitments, and also to advocate for things such as a meaningful loss and damage facility. If we are genuine in our commitment to a just transition, it must not just be for communities in Ireland. That commitment must extend in solidarity to people beyond our shores to encompass the entire global community. </p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Dillon<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_646">Ireland faces a challenging time in meeting its climate action, EU and COP26 obligations. The need for climate action is clear and the changes we need to make to address climate challenges will affect all aspects of the way we live our lives. The move to green enterprise services and energy use in public and private transport has already begun. Many operations in Ireland in the manufacturing services and retail sectors are making major advances in the positive climate action policies implemented. The climate action plan generally references just transition in terms of fairness, inclusion and protection of the most vulnerable. It also references just transition within climate policy as a transition to a climate resilient, biodiversity rich and environmentally sustainable and climate neutral economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> In this debate, I will take a balanced view in assessing the scale of challenge and identify practical, deliverable solutions to facilitate a just transition for someone living in rural Ireland. We must ensure people and communities are placed front and centre in our climate action policies, which have the potential to open up new employment and enterprise opportunities, new jobs, new skills and a chance to create a more productive and resilient economy. Through the national and EU just transition funds, the Government needs to deliver flagship projects throughout the country, at scale, to assist communities in the transition to a carbon neutral economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">The Government must invest and support local authorities to undertake the grant administration role on behalf of the Department on delivery of these projects that will be adequately resourced in the years ahead. The Government must also maximise its resources and strengths in the green economy that will support employment opportunities for rural communities in areas such as renewable energy, sustainable tourism, energy retrofitting, the bioeconomy and the circular economy. The Government must also enable community energy projects to support the target of generating at least 70% of electricity by renewable means by 2030 through supports such as the community benefit fund and a community category within the renewable energy support fund. Prioritisation by Government must also be given to the development of microgeneration of renewable electricity, allowing people to sell excess power back to the grid through the establishment of the microgeneration scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> Ireland has made significant progress in its commitment to climate action from fossil fuel divestment, a ban on fracking, to the development of the national just transition fund. However, many obstacles remain, and there is much work yet to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_651">In addressing just transition we need to mark where we are today in regard to climate change and its impact throughout the world. In our politics and public life there is still the sense that climate change and the just transition are still some time away and that we still have time to prepare for them. However, this week parts of India reached 49oC and parts of Pakistan reached 51oC. That scorching heat makes record-breaking heatwaves 100 times more likely. As some forecasters have put it, extreme heat events that would usually take place every 300 years might now occur every three years. Closer to home in Europe, Cordoba in Spain is expected to hit 43oC this weekend. We are not immune to any of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> At this stage we have to wonder whether the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications actually gets it. Far from giving party political advice, this really is not about seats or elections because we are facing an existential crisis. The Green Party is meant to be synonymous with environmentalism, so the Minister of State really has a huge responsibility here. He seems to have been captured by the old-fashioned pre-climate change economics of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil where growth is king and let us not upset big business. On just transition it seems to be taking a genteel, almost academic observer position on something that needs a radical and revolutionary response. When it comes to just transition we do not even have a proper definition of it, despite the efforts of Sinn Féin and many others among the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> I am really concerned about the people who are already barely hanging on, crucified by price hikes in rents, fuel, energy and, shortly, food. These are people who are not racing around the suburbs in SUVs or flying off on holidays a few times a year. The people to whom I refer live miles from public transport and can only afford a banger rather than a new electric vehicle. These people have done the least harm and cannot be left to fend for themselves. How on earth are they going to manage to just hurry up and transition given that they are already so far behind, so excluded by a tepid response to a scorching issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> Sinn Féin wants just transition, not the order to simply hurry up and transition that we seem to hear from Government. Our world is on fire and the Government is tiptoeing around with artisan buckets as opposed to the hose we need to keep people and life alive on this planet, delighted with itself for using environmentally-friendly buckets and saving the price of calling the fire brigade. As Deputy Ó Cathasaigh said recently, when he started off on a marathon, he was not prepared for it. He realised very quickly that the world does not, and will not, care. We really want to be getting on with just transition.</p>

          <p eId="para_655">Global warming is accelerating, of that there is no doubt. Peat harvesting in the midlands was to be phased out over a ten-year period. It was phased out in ten months. The people of the midlands, who were most impacted by that, in particular those in Laois-Offaly, sucked that up. Those people have borne the brunt of that and have got on with it. However, Bord na Móna is currently facing legal threats from a group which is trying to block the removal of harvested peat. This is peat that was harvested four or five years ago on bogs such as Cul na Ceart, Cúil na Móna and Cashel bogs. That peat is stockpiled and can only be used legally for horticulture in Ireland. That is the agreement of the contract for moving the peat. I want Members to hear this because I am an environmentalist, and I think the Minister of State is also and will understand what I am saying. This peat is covered in polythene. The polythene will disintegrate over the next couple of years if it is not removed. The polythene will enter watercourses and the peat piles will become destabilised and enter the watercourses because there is dry peat underneath. This will cause pollution in the vicinity of the bogs. Bord na Móna wants to rewet these bogs. As we all know, we need them as carbon sinks. However, Bord na Móna cannot rewet them while the peat stockpiles are on them, so they need to be removed. Bord na Móna is trying to find an environmental solution and cannot do it if this threat is followed through. What are the Government and the Minister of State doing about this? We need to get on top of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> I have a second issue to raise in regard to retrofitting homes. Homes in Laois-Offaly are badly impacted by the transition away from peat because it has the highest number of homes dependent on peat and solid fuel. They do not have an option. Many homes do not have oil. They have no retrofitting because it is not coming quickly enough. An answer to a recent parliamentary question indicated that only ten deep retrofits were completed last year. The Government said that 5,000 will be done in 2022 but there are almost a million homes to be done. We need to ramp that up drastically.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> Some €650 million was collected in carbon tax last year and more than €400 million in the previous years. Money needs to be ploughed into ramping up the retrofitting of homes, in particular homes that are not even double-glazed. There are low-income households whose homes - I have been in them - do not have insulation and double glazing and the heat is flying out of them. Those people are being most impacted by fuel poverty. We need to help those people and we need to get on top of it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> We need a just transition. What we have had so far is an unjust transition. In particular I want the Minister to pay attention to that Bord na Móna issue of peat stockpiles. We need to rewet those bogs. This group is stopping an environmental solution and is going to cause environmental damage. Someone needs to talk sense to this group.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Whitmore<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_659">I thank the Minister of State for the opportunity to have this debate today. It was a pleasant surprise to see it on this week’s agenda. I was anticipating perhaps some announcement from the Government in regard to just transition and the plans for it. I am disappointed with the level of progress outlined today. From listening to and reading the Minister of State’s speech, it seems that one thing is missing all the time. I do not know why the Government is so hesitant to put it down in black and white what it means by “just transition”. How is this defined? It is one of those phrases that gets trotted out at regular intervals by people in government and in opposition yet we have no actual definition of what a just transition is. Until we have a definition there is absolutely no way anyone can be held accountable for meeting or not meeting it. In the absence of a definition, how do Departments, Ministers, NGOs or local authorities know whether they are doing the right thing? A definition would provide a checklist for Government and for everyone to say what their policy is, that they meet this aspect of just transition, that they see the economic transition is not great and have identified social consequences and that they will ensure there are no social consequences. We need a checklist and a definition would give us that. I and others tried to get a definition into the climate Bill but the Government refused to take that on board. I tried to get a definition into the recent circular economy Bill but, again, the Government refused to take that on board. It is not that it has not been done in other places. Scotland has done it. I do not understand the hesitancy in government to put down what a just transition is to ensure it is not just a term trotted out when it is expedient for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> I welcome the fact the Minister of State outlined the just transition principles in his speech. He talked about placing social dialogue at the heart of climate policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">It is important to namecheck the trade union movement in that. Just transition started off as a trade union and workers issue. It is broader than that but it is important that the work, dialogue and contribution of trade unions is acknowledged and that the part they can play be counted in the principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> Principle No. 3 states: "That the costs are shared so that the impact is equitable and existing inequalities are not exacerbated." The Government should be more ambitious. Not only should we make sure that existing inequalities are not exacerbated but we should be ambitious about making sure we start addressing those inequalities. Now is the time we are at a crossroads and have opportunities to use the environmental, social and economic change that we will have to implement to meet our climate targets. Let us use this as an opportunity to make things better and ensure we do not make things worse. I ask that the Minister of State reflect that in the policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> I do not get a sense of urgency with just transition. The Minister of State talked about the just transition commission, which was a programme for Government commitment and which is a commitment under the climate action plan. However, I understand it will be 2023 before that is established. That will be three years into the Government and a year to a year and a half after the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 was passed. There is no point in doing this work after the policies and the legislation are in place. Just transition needs to be a foundation and the framework by which policies are developed. It should not be brought in after the fact because that will undermine the policies. Just transition needs to be developed now and the commission is needed now, as quickly as possible. This is something I have been raising since I was elected and I reintroduced a Bill of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan’s on a just transition commission because I recognised that it was something that had to be done quickly. The time for talking is over and it is time for action now. There is a risk of these policies being developed in a way that will make things worse for people and that then the commission will come in and try to rectify that practice. I ask, therefore, that there be some sense of urgency with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> When we look at the record of Government to date in rolling out programmes, we must ask if it has taken just transition into account to date and I would have to say it has not. There have been attempts, such as the retrofitting programme, which is targeting low income households and people on social welfare with grants. However, there is a huge swathe of people, including low to middle income earners, who need to make changes and who will be getting little support from the Government when it comes to retrofitting. There was an opportunity to target those people and to apply just transition principles to ensuring the retrofitting programme did what it should have done, which unfortunately did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> The Minister of State said that there needs to be social dialogue and that the Government needs to listen and consult and I ask him to reflect on the discussions we had on turf recently. Some 3,500 people engaged with that consultation process and it was clear from the consultation report that people did not know what the Government regulations were about. They thought it was a ban on turf and they told the Government that. The Government did the consultation but it did not listen and that is an important point to make. If the Government is talking about just transition and engaging with communities, then it should take what they say on board and listen to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_671">I am sure Deputy Cowen will tell me to sit down shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> We are here to talk about just transition and the word "just" needs to be focused on. It means fair and equal and just transition is good but it is not geographically fair or equal. If you look at a county like Clare, which I represent, over a number of years we have had an incremental winding down of operations at Moneypoint and the winding back of coal burning operations. There is no just transition for people in Clare and for those who have worked in that plant for many years. There is a bright future and the Green Atlantic project and there is the prospect of 600 jobs and a multimillion euro investment. There is light at the end of the tunnel but for people in Clare and for people who wait for the development of that Green Atlantic offshore wind project, they have to wait a full decade. Given the rate of inflation and how cyclical things are, it is essential that just transition is again renewed and considered on a more geographically fair and equal basis to include County Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> I want to talk about turf. With the way speaking time goes in the Dáil, it is not every day you get a speaking slot on a topic you want to speak about. When I was elected in 2020 with many others, as a newcomer to the Dáil, I signed up to a programme for Government that contained many things. Some Wednesday nights I vote for things that are wonderful and sometimes there are things that I have found to challenge my set of beliefs. One thing I never agreed to in a programme for Government was to ban, in any shape or form, the harvesting or sale of turf and I am glad that proposal has been wound back. We need to tackle air pollution and air quality in the country but turf cutting in a county like Clare is dying out anyway. I know of few people cutting turf and those who do so bag it up in old fertiliser bags before selling it at the local petrol station for €5 or €6 per bag. It is a small trade that is dying out and it was mean spirited, anti-rural and all those other things to even consider banning the harvesting and sale of turf.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> I want to speak about wind energy guidelines because these are also intrinsic to the debate we are rightly having about greening our economy and meeting all of our climate change targets. Wind energy is already supplying a large amount of our electricity but there has been a set of guidelines, in draft format, on the desk of the Minister for Environment, Climate Action and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, since early 2020. The current wind energy guidelines date all the way back to 2006. They are 16 years old, they are not fit for purpose and they are among the most outdated in Europe. Depending on which side of the fence you sit on, if you are in the industry and you cannot wait to build more of these and multiply them throughout the countryside, or if you are a resident who is concerned that these are too near your home with the flicker effect and the noise outputs of them, both sides of this argument need to move on with real guidelines that are meaningful and relevant to the planning process nowadays. Yet another planning file was put out in Clare yesterday with further information on a wind energy project because the guidelines are unclear and insufficient and we have planning officials trying to interpret 2006 policy against what modern standards are. It has no correlation whatsoever and I ask that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, might move that quickly. I will do a generous thing and give some of my time to my colleague, Deputy Cowen.</p>

          <p eId="para_675">Like others, I welcome this opportunity. We never have enough time to get through all we want to get through save for reminding the Minister of State of the obligations that are on Government and of the commitments that have been made and to seek to ensure that those commitments are acted on and provided for and have the desired effect and impact. I am from the constituency that is arguably the most impacted by the acceleration of decarbonisation in recent years. We have seen the earlier than anticipated closure of power stations in Lanesborough in Longford and in Shannonbridge, Ferbane and Rhode in Offaly. We have seen Bord na Móna's industrial excavation of peat cease as a result of that and its commitment to decarbonisation has resulted in the anticipated closure of Derrinlough briquette factory in 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> This is an industry that has served our region so well since the 1930s and 1940s until the 1980s when there were up to 6,000 or 7,000 people employed in those industries. Bord na Móna was set up in the 1940s with a remit to develop that region and to ensure there were ample jobs and opportunities. It can no longer fulfil that remit so the onus and responsibility falls back on the Government to take up the mantle and provide for that process. In opposition, I worked with the then Government and the then Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to ensure and agree that the increases in carbon taxes be ring-fenced for the purpose of just transition for the midlands region. Poverty-proofing provisions were initiated, in addition to other initiatives and the midlands just transition board and team were provided with ample funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste last week. I noted that the proposed territorial plan relating to the midlands just transition fund is due for final submission by Government and subsequent approval to the European Commission. I commend the Government on matching the already committed €84.5 million EU funding in the national development plan ensuring that €170 million will be put in place for the coming years. It is imperative that the procedure of submission and approval is done as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> It is now almost three years since Councillor Eamon Dooley of Offaly County Council and I visited Brussels to meet the Commission. We made the case for the inclusion of the peat regions of Ireland in the fund already approved for the coal regions of Europe, providing necessary funding to assist those regions in responding to the acceleration of decarbonisation. Thankfully, that was approved and the new Commission and new Government ensured that was progressed. I also welcome what appears to be universal backing for the appointment of the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly as the administrative entity to deliver just transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> I further acknowledge the Government's commitment to ring-fencing the revenue derived from those increases to initiatives to assist in the transition away from dependency on fossil fuels. It is vital that the recently announced national retrofitting scheme should as soon as practicable accommodate a special provision for households currently dependent on solid fuels for heating purposes to be afforded an 80% grant towards the transition in addition to the installation grant already provided in the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> I also encourage the Government to ensure policies and directives associated with clean air policy omit turf-dependent households and recognise their need to obtain that solid fuel either by virtue of their own property rights or by purchasing from local turf cutters with whom they have established commercial and personal relationships over many years. I agree that any such sales should not be advertised or transacted in retail outlets. I have no doubt that with the incentives mentioned together with the updated building guidelines the practice of turf cutting will cease organically in the years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> I highlight to the relevant Ministers my support for the recommendations Offaly County Council made in its submission during the consultation process on the territorial plan. I remind the Minister of State of the section which concurs with the conclusion of a comprehensive analysis carried out by EnvEcon which found that Offaly is the county most negatively affected by accelerated decarbonisation, followed by Longford, Westmeath and Laois. I have no doubt as a result of that and as a result of independent analysis and data that has been made available that targeted funding will reflect these findings from weighted multicriteria assessment. I know that my colleagues in Laois, Deputies Stanley and Flanagan, will agree with that contention and acknowledge the information that has been presented now as qualifying data to support that contention.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> As the Minister of State will know, I have made a complaint to the European Commission about the activities of a dominant force in the electricity market in this country. I have contacted the European Commissioners for Energy and Competition. I met the Commissioner for Energy along with local MEP, Billy Kelleher, last week. I note the inaction to date on the part of the CRU, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Department. I urge the Minister of State to use his good offices to ensure that the Government is more proactive in this matter because the inaction over the dominant player's territorialism is part of the reason for Ireland having energy costs that are way out of line.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> That is not just my contention based on the independent assessment and data that I have made available but in recent weeks a EUROSTAT report confirmed that Irish energy prices to households and businesses are 25% above the European average. It is a serious matter for industrial and domestic consumers. The Government needs to get to the root of this irrespective of the inferences, insinuations and assertions I have made which, of course, will be investigated. The Government needs to be sure that the ambition contained in the programme for Government has the potential to succeed. Some would argue that it is not as ambitious as it should be considering the vast wealth of resources we have off the west coast and the potential to create a pan-European supply together with our partners in Europe, especially southern Europe, regarding the wealth of solar power they have.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> We can be at the front of a pipe rather than at the back end of one along with many other parts of Europe which are dependent on Russian gas today. I hope the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, initiates an investigation into the workings of the CRU, EirGrid and the wholesale energy market in this country to find out why we have not realised the ambition we had for the last ten years, never mind the great ambition that needs to be acted upon in the next ten years.</p>

          <p eId="para_685">The just translation concept was conceived to assist counties and communities most affected by the move from fossil fuels to transition in a just manner to other forms of energy generation and other means of employment where generational employment had ended. Last year Sinn Féin sought to define a just transition and just translation principles and to ensure that Government adhered to them when preparing climate action plans and carbon budgets. The Minister rejected our amendments and the amendments of others to the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill which would have improved this very week definition of a just transition. We wanted accountability. We wanted Government to explain how proposals and policies would affect different sectors, households, communities and regions and the ways in which Government would support them in transitioning. It was an entirely pragmatic and reasonable approach but was rejected outright.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> To date my constituents in Longford-Westmeath tell me that their experience of just transition has been overwhelmingly negative. While extraordinary sacrifices have been made by the communities across the midlands, to date this has not been matched by support and services from Government or State agencies in a way that reflects a true just transition. That is why towns such as Lanesborough in Longford and others like it experienced unprecedented levels of anxiety like never before when it became clear there was no sign of the jobs lost being replaced with any form of meaningful quality employment opportunities for those workers most affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> A truly just transition can protect and create jobs, and also protect and restore biodiversity and generate sustainable resilient communities. Job losses are not the automatic outcome of moving to greener energy. That comes from bad planning and poor policy decisions during the transition process. There must be proactive engagement and structured dialogue. Key planning indicators need to be established and met. That is key to a just transition process. However, for some inexplicable and inexcusable reason that has been absent to date. That simply is not good enough for communities most affected by the transition to greener energy. They must be the priority for a meaningful just transition. Areas like those in my constituency cannot simply be left behind or be told if not in words definitely in actions to simply suck it up.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnnyMythen" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Deputy Johnny Mythen<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_688">According to the EU, the idea of transition is that no one is left behind. However, rural areas of Ireland are being left behind. Rural public transport is non-existent. Rural public services are non-existent. The Government is not doing enough to mitigate the ground-breaking and life-changing proposals that those in rural areas are being asked to operate under. Rural communities function on a completely different eco and social plateau from large urban areas. This is a major concern when it comes to climate action. People in rural areas want to play their part in climate action. Up to €84.5 million has been allocated to Ireland under the EU just transition fund. This funding is highly focused on the midlands. Many rural areas, such as county Wexford, will also need financial support for just transition. Rural areas operate on a small ecosystem. Farmers, fishers and those working for small and medium-sized enterprises circulate their money directly into their local economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Remove one cog from the wheel of climate action, for example the fishers, farmers or foresters, acting without a robust and just economic alternative, and the whole thing collapses. It has a domino effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> What action plan, roadmap and timelines are there for a just transition for the rest of rural Ireland, including Wexford? Public transport and the reliance on cars are among the main targeted areas of climate action. In Wexford, we do not have a reliable and accessible form of rural public transport to rely on, nor have we the proper infrastructure to support electric vehicles. This Government needs to transform rural transport in areas such as Wexford if we are truly to move people away from reliance on cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> The Wexford coastline is an area that is most suitable for offshore wind farms. I support wind energy and the value of energy security for Ireland, especially when we see the awful effects of the war in Ukraine and the international fallout for energy supplies. We can, and should, plan for our own self-sufficient and sustainable supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> When it comes to Wexford, we must always take cognisance of the traditional fishing and charter boat industries. They cannot be forgotten as custodians of the sea when it comes to these large, green infrastructural changes. Unfortunately, the Government's green schemes are not working. Quick transition seems to be the priority rather than the most important element of fairness. Sustainability and pragmatic solutions must be rural-proofed, inclusive and, above all, practical and workable. Biomethane, hydrogen, wind and solar energy must remain the focus of the Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_693"> Food security must be considered region by region. Rural Ireland has a major part to play in developing our country in a self-sufficient and prosperous way. A just transition is about making sure we leave nobody behind on our journey to a greener environment. I urge the Government to seriously consider and act on the points that have been raised.</p>

        <speech by="#GinoKenny" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Deputy Gino Kenny<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_694">I welcome this important debate. Just transition is not just a national policy but an international policy. Environmentalists use the great phase that we must act locally and think globally. Everything we do locally is everything we do globally. For a just transition, we need to think of the environmental space as the place and country in which we live and the world we all share. That policy is important, as the Minister of State knows, because to tackle the environmental damage that has been done, and continues to be done, we need to be radical in what we do, individually, collectively and politically.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> I wish to speak about one aspect of the just transition, namely, the retrofit programme. I will speak from personal experience. The estate in which I live in Clondalkin, which is made up of 40 houses, applied for the community energy grant scheme. Deep retrofit of a house is revolutionary. It has transformed energy bills. In an ideal world, it would be fantastic if everyone could do likewise but that is not possible because it takes time to retrofit housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> I will share with the House some statistics that show the challenge around the retrofit of, in particular, local authority houses. South Dublin County Council has just under 10,000 and less than 1% were retrofitted last year. If one does the maths, it will take decades to complete. The scheme has wrapped up this year with the retrofit of 250 houses. At that rate, it will take a considerable amount of time to complete. I have heard some reports, though not relating to the estate I am from, that some of the works have been haphazard and that there may be a problem in terms of the standard of the retrofit. It could be problematic not only in the present but also in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> The retrofit programme needs to be extended to everybody. It is important to do that regardless of people's means. We are asking people to spend €50,000 upfront and that is an enormous amount of money. Many people cannot afford that and it can be a barrier to retrofitting.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> In Italy, the vast majority of people will get a retrofit of their homes completely free of charge. The Italian Government has brought forward that policy for retrofitting. It is good that there are no financial impediments to retrofitting.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> Retrofitting is one of the cornerstones of a just transition. Everyone who has a house, whether provided by a local authority or a private house, in this country is lucky. Our energy bills and carbon footprints need to be smaller and that can be addressed and achieved through the retrofit programme. We need to be more ambitious and ensure the programme is State-led rather than looking for the invisible hand of the private sector to address those issues. That can be problematic because of the limits on the number of houses, particularly local authority houses, that can be retrofitted. The figures at the moment suggest it will take decades before the last people on the list have their houses retrofitted. Retrofitting can make an enormous difference to people's homes, particularly in wintertime when their energy bills are high. A person who is facing fuel poverty spends a considerable proportion of his or her cash on energy bills. If such people had their houses retrofitted, it is a no-brainer that their bills would go down and they would be spending less. The environmental damage would also be reduced. That should give us pause for thought.</p>

          <p eId="para_700">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the discussion about the just transition mechanism. It is a dynamic and proactive framework that identifies opportunities for public and private investment that is both sustainable and inclusive. It is a fair and effective way of ensuring that everyone can work together to fight the climate emergency. The just transition fund is designed to assist countries across Europe to meet the challenges of the green transition in line with our goal of making the EU climate neutral by 2050. Doing this effectively and fairly is critical because that is how we ensure nobody is left behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> Ireland's ambition is to become a world leader in climate action. That is a big statement but we need big thinking now because we are no longer living in a time of climate change; we are living through a climate emergency. Everyone in Ireland can make the changes set out in the climate action plan and we need to encourage and support everyone to make those changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> Ireland is set to receive €84.5 million from the EU just transition fund over the programme period. That is a big figure but big thinking needs to be backed up with big financial supports. That is why we need to think nationally. As we know, the wider midlands region has been proposed as the only area for investment under the just transition plan. Some people have expressed the fear of being left behind. This must be a transition that works for the whole country, not just the wider midlands region. We need to support everyone to introduce climate change mitigation measures and that is why I welcome the range of benefits and supports offered by the European Union. </p>
          <p eId="para_703"> The just transition will protect people and communities by offering reskilling opportunities and investments to combat energy poverty. It will assist people and communities who want to gain access to clear, affordable and secure energy. Nationally, we are seeing a step change in energy efficiency and in our societal desire to be more climate conscious. The just transition mechanism is also going to support companies by supporting them to transition to low-carbon technologies and economic diversification.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> Before being elected to Dáil Éireann, I worked as chief of staff for a multinational organisation. Driving corporate climate responsibility is something about which I am very passionate. That is why I strongly welcome the investment in creating new firms, start-ups, research and innovation activities. That allows us to bring fresh and innovative ideas to the table to address the climate emergency effectively. The mechanism will support the investment in public and sustainable transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Sustainable transport is a serious issue that must be addressed to deliver on climate action. This week we saw practical measures come into play to enable people in my constituency and right across Ireland to access public transport at a more affordable rate. That is a genuine incentive and we need to ensure that commuters are getting an added incentive through the Taxsaver ticket, which they are not currently because it has not been changed to reflect the new scheme. </p>
          <p eId="para_706"> Public consultation on a draft of Ireland's territorial just transition plan took place earlier this year. Feedback was gathered at it and one of those feedback workshops specifically sought the views of younger people working, living or studying in the midlands region and it is really important that we listen carefully to what they had to say. We owe it to our younger people who have been so vocal about their feelings on this issue to listen. We cannot and must not let them down. Floods, storms and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, more destructive and more fatal. Climate change is the truth. It is not a lie. We owe it to the next generation to leave Ireland in a state that is fit for their purpose. We need a just transition to ensure that Ireland can achieve this and achieve our climate action goals. </p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Leddin<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_707">Yesterday I had the honour of attending the Norwegian constitution day celebrations at the ambassador's residence with a number of other guests, including Members of this Oireachtas. It was a great occasion and I got to meet a number of people who are working on developing the wind energy sector in Ireland. Indeed, the Norwegians are very interested in what Ireland plans to do in that regard. I had a very interesting conversation with Mr. Liam Curran of Enterprise Ireland and Mr. Cormac Gebruers of the National Maritime College of Ireland in Ringaskiddy, Cork. At the risk of quoting Tracy Chapman, we were talking about a revolution; a revolution that Ireland is going to experience in energy generation. We are going to become a net energy exporter. I see Deputy Devlin smiling. He attends meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action week in, week out and hears about this and contributes to the debates, as does Deputy O'Rourke. It is something that we talk about a lot, the revolution that is coming to Ireland, if we plan things well. For me, that revolution must have a just transition attached to it and it will.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> Mr. Gebruers talked about Irish coastal villages and communities and he said that some of them only make sense from the sea and there is some resonance there. I certainly have always thought that. As a young man, I rowed on the Shannon Estuary up towards King John's Castle in Limerick city and the perspective one gets from our waterways, whether from the sea or from our rivers, is quite unique. It is clear that so many of our communities only make sense from the sea. The energy revolution that we are going to have is going to make sense for these communities, right around Ireland. Towns and villages like Foynes, Kilrush, Killybegs, Ringaskiddy, Castletownbere, Rosslare, Dundalk and many others are set to benefit hugely from this energy revolution that is coming. </p>
          <p eId="para_709"> In talking about a revolution and a just transition, we are talking about breathing life back into these communities and turning around decades, and in some cases, more than a century of decline. Just transition is about education, reskilling and providing opportunities for young people to stay in their own communities because many of them want to. That is true of our small villages and towns as well as our cities, and that is what just transition is about. It is a term that is often misused and abused. It can be a political football, kicked from Government to Opposition and back. If we are honest about what a just transition is, we need to see it as an opportunity to open up employment and enterprise for our communities all around Ireland. Climate action requires a major change in how we live our lives and for many it will mean changes in work, education, how we get around, what we eat and how we travel. Change is always perceived to be hard and when it is not managed or planned, it can be devastating for people's livelihoods and communities. If managed well, with a just transition, it will mean better jobs, more resilient communities, a cleaner environment and a healthier ecosystem. </p>

          <p eId="para_710">I welcome the opportunity to examine the Government's progress on delivering a just transition as Ireland implements a low carbon future. At the heart of the policy is recognition that families and communities must be supported and protected against the negative impacts of the transition away from fossil fuels. Key to supporting these initiatives is funding and we have seen €84.5 million secured from the EU's just transition fund for investment in longer-term transition over the coming decade. The fund will be complemented by Exchequer funding, which is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> I have been a long-standing supporter of retrofitting schemes and I welcome the Government's national retrofitting scheme. However, I am concerned about the delays in progress and about the capacity of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to roll it out at scale. I am also concerned about the lack of progress in retrofitting and improving our local authority housing stock, particularly in advance of what will be a very difficult winter. I ask the Minister to redouble efforts in this area to ensure that the local authorities have funding available to implement quick fixes as they prepare for a more extensive programme over the course of the decade. Recent changes to the better energy warmer homes scheme to expand eligibility for home owners in receipt of the disability allowance for over six months and who have a child under seven are extremely welcome. I ask the Minister to make a concerted effort to highlight these new opportunities. </p>
          <p eId="para_712"> I ask the Minister to examine the effectiveness of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to ensure it has sufficient resources to police energy companies and to ensure that customers are being offered the best rate. I have had reports of consumers being told certain products or special electricity rates would not suit them when it is clear from any objective analysis that they would be better off. I would also ask for arrangements and regulations around the district heating schemes to be examined. I have had reports of some district heating customers receiving notice of a fourfold increase in natural gas rates but as district heating customers, they have no power to change supplier. </p>
          <p eId="para_713"> As we move towards a low carbon economy, it is critical that people at risk of fuel and energy poverty or communities at risk of economic disadvantage are supported. The Government's medium and long-term strategy is sound but I would like to see more ambition in the short term.</p>

          <p eId="para_714">I live in the heart of rural Ireland, in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. The vast majority of people generally agree that we need to change the way we live in order to tackle the climate crisis but this needs to be done in an equitable way. The price of home heating oil, for example, increased by 50% in the 12 months to January 2022. This was prior to the recent decision by the Government to increase the carbon tax. Imposing these increases in carbon taxes while inflation is already disproportionately impacting the living standards of low- and middle-income households is completely unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> Carbon taxes and the cost of petrol and diesel are having a disproportionate effect on people in rural Ireland. Petrol prices have increased by 30% and diesel prices by a similar rate and yet the Government recently voted to increase the carbon tax on transport fuels and this will be increased further later in the year. As farmers and contractors must rely on heavy machinery which operates on diesel, they have no option but to pay for diesel. Parents in rural areas need to drive their children to school or childcare and they must drive to work because, for the most part, there is a lack of proper public transport. There are no trains going to Cavan or Monaghan and bus services in many rural areas are very light on the ground. </p>
          <p eId="para_716"> Turf and peat harvesting are also being restricted on many bogs throughout the country. This has led to the importation of briquettes and peat and that does not make any sense whatsoever in the context of the climate crisis. Many rural families depend on turf to heat their homes. A proper plan needs to be put in place for the harvesting of peat products for the domestic sectors that need them. </p>
          <p eId="para_717"> Retrofitting houses is an important part of fighting climate change but even with grants, it is far too expensive for most people. The waiting list for households eligible for free energy upgrades such as the better energy warmer homes scheme is now in excess of two years. Between 2019 and the end of January this year only 118 homes in Cavan and 85 in Monaghan have been completed under this scheme, which is dismal. There is a need for far greater investment in this area. </p>
          <p eId="para_718"> We cannot allow social justice to be removed from climate action. We need to invest in public transport, good quality public housing and in wind and solar energy. </p>
          <p eId="para_719">We also need to undertake an ambitious afforestation programme, begin the process of retrofitting our housing stock and expand our renewable energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p eId="para_720">At the centre of any debate around climate change there needs to be a discussion on how ordinary workers are protected from the sharp edge of any new policies. The move towards a greener society is very doable but it is important that the Government brings everybody along with them, and that it does not hammer those who cannot afford to switch to alternatives in the short term. One only has to look at the Government's new retrofitting scheme to find an example of policy that disadvantages those who have the least ability to pay. If you are lucky enough to have €25,000 to spare you can apply for another €25,000 even if you can well afford it. There are also grants for electric vehicles but the catch is that you must be in a position to buy a brand new electric car.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> The vast majority of people cannot afford to access any of these incentives. Those people who could do with a leg up are never going to get ahead if the bar is set too high. Policies need to be proofed with the social and economic impacts in mind. We need to avoid penalising people who have not got an alternative. In Sinn Féin's alternative budget for 2022 we allocated €10.8 million towards a just transition commission. The Government has plans to establish a commission but it really needs to be done now as a matter of urgency. A just transition should be to the benefit of everybody and not just those with deep pockets. We need to do everything we can to support those who do not have the money to go green.</p>

          <p eId="para_722">At the outset, I want to say that I am not a climate change denier but I am a realist. So far, I have not heard enough debate that I could say is a level debate or equal to both sides. I reiterate some of what I said in the statements on agriculture last week. The level of balance when it comes to debating climate change and climate action measures is non-existent among our public service broadcasters. Private media companies are entitled to promote particular editorial opinions on whatever subjects they like. The same should not be the case for public service broadcasting.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> One of the most impactful pieces of legislation to pass through these Houses last year was the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021. It floated through these Houses and the media with little scrutiny, while opponents of the Bill were treated with disdain by the ruling classes. Not only did the Opposition parties such as Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats, the Labour Party and People Before Profit unite with the Government to support the Bill, unbelievably they complained that it did not go far enough. Then, having voted for a Bill that places an enormous cost burden on the ordinary working person, they stand up here on a regular basis complaining about the cost of living and that the Government should be taking measures to deal with it. Did any one of those who supported the climate action Bill, think through the consequences of the Bill before voting for it? It will make absolutely no material difference to climate change, but it is causing serious hardship to those struggling to make ends meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> Did those who voted for the Bill not realise that raising the carbon tax every year until 2030 will have the greatest negative impact on the poorest in society? Petrol and diesel prices are rising again almost back up to the €2 per litre mark. Those who rely on public transport and who are in a position to be able to avail of public transport, are not affected by the rising cost of fuel, yet these are the people who received in the past few days a 25% discount on their travel costs. The 15 cent excise reduction amounted, at the time, to a 7.5% discount on fuel. Due to rising prices, however, it was not really a discount at all. Yet, those who use public transport are getting a 25% discount. The people cannot use public transport because it is not available in their area, particularly in most of rural Ireland, are effectively being left out of Government supports but paying the taxes that the carbon tax has increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> Those who are affected most by the rising cost of fuel are those in rural Ireland and those who simply have no alternative. It would seem that Government policy is trying to gradually phase out rural Ireland altogether. Planning authorities are trying to make it next to impossible to build a house in rural Ireland. So much so that in years to come, and very few years to come, the rural GAA club, the rural school, the rural pub and the rural church will be a distant memory in many areas while we will all be herded into suburbia and while here on this small island our heritage, culture and society is being eroded in the name of saving the planet, China will be building more coal-powered plants. The cost of these mad climate policies is estimated by Professor Michael Kelly at €200,000 per household. There has not been a proper debate about whether or not our approach is the correct one, if it is going at the right pace, or if it is focusing on the correct things.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> I spoke last week about Ireland's pathetic performance when it comes to planting trees. Trees are a proven and effective way of absorbing carbon and are vitally important. Yet, the Government seems totally disinterested in meeting the targets for tree planting. Not only is the Government not interested in planting trees, it is making it very cumbersome to manage woodlands due to a ridiculous licensing system, which needs reform. Carbon tax is currently €41 per tonne and people are at their wits' end trying to make ends meet with these increases. Unless this runaway train is halted by a large dose of cop on, at some stage carbon taxes will increase to €100 per tonne by 2030. We cannot tax ordinary people into poverty as a solution to climate change.</p>

          <p eId="para_727">I wish to say a few words about this in the short time that I have. In my mind, just transition has been explained by Deputy Leddin and others as doing something in society that is correct and right to make sure that our communities grow and that there is enterprise in them. I agree with all of that. We should have more resilient communities but we need to transition to that and we cannot just do it overnight. There are some things we must take into account. Much has been spoken about the turf regulations that the Minister of State will bring in during October. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, to consider all of the local authority houses in the State that rely on turf to heat their homes, to have hot water and to cook. Will the Minister of State consider how quickly he can provide the funding to the local authorities to retrofit these houses so that they have actually transitioned from solid fuel to air-to-water, and the cost of that?</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> Take the electric vehicles we are putting into this country. We are encouraging people to buy these cars. I know of one man who sold the electric car he bought last year on the basis that there is no infrastructure of any means in place for him to charge his car. Basically, the biggest issue of all is that he cannot put in a charger at home because the ESB will not connect the proposed charging point directly to the meter out the back due to the distance to his electricity meter. That kind of stuff has got to stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> The deep retrofit programme, which has been announced, is still not in place. People cannot avail of it. Surveys have been carried out but we are not getting to do the work. Another issue that keeps arising with the retrofit scheme is the quality of the materials we are using, if they are actually fit for purpose in a country like ours where we have huge variations and wet weather and if the external insulation will stand the test of time. Are we creating problems? Reports have been prepared on that. That type of thing is truly something where we could be walking ourselves into an environmental disaster rather than into a place where we are saving our planet.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> We have had discussions on public transport. It needs to be improved upon and it needs to be provided for everybody if we are to have a just transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">We must make sure, for instance, that the railway line from Claremorris up to Athenry is put in place. We are doing a rail review at the moment. I believe, however, that there are actually things that can be done if we are really serious about providing public transport rather than taxing people who have to use their cars because they have no other way of going to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will tell the Minister that if he listens to Galway Bay FM, or the national traffic reports, he will always hear about Bóthar na dTreabh in Galway. The reason that is blocked up is because people have to travel by car from the east of the county to work in the city and back out again in the evenings. And what is wrong? We cannot build a bus lane from Claregalway into the city. We have been talking about it since 2007 and we still have not got around to actually building it. Everybody wants to do it but it is not being done. If we are really and truly fair about just transition, we need to act and set out a detailed plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_733">I am going to use my time today to make an argument for the inclusion of two particular groups as primary parts of just transition. Before I do, however, I wish to make the point that it is fantastic to have the chance today to talk about just transition and there are many good things to talk about, including the EU just transition fund and the €180 million in funding committed to Bord na Móna's bog restoration. There are actions afoot, which is so positive. I am concerned, however, that we have not yet legislated for the just transition commission. I believe we may be a few months away from that legislation. I wish to highlight the fact that although we are talking about huge sums of money when it comes to just transition, and quite rightly because it is a huge undertaking, the commission itself will not be an expensive undertaking. The just transition commission in Scotland from the years 2018 to 2022 cost only £321,000. The future generations fund in Wales is funded every year to the tune of £1.5 million. While we are not talking about big money in this regard, it is incredibly important that we have a legally robust framework and the commission certainly is very important in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> Two groups must be primary elements in the just transition, the first of which is unions. Some of my colleagues in the Chamber have already pointed this out but the phrase "just transition" is a union phrase. Many of the industries that will be most impacted by the move to a low-carbon society are highly unionised workplaces. It is incredibly important that from the very get-go, we bring unions into the dialogue from the ground up. Unions are their workers, and we need workers to tell us how to transition in a way that makes sense for their communities. I ask for that in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> In what is kind of a counterpoint to the issue of unions being at the very heart of just transition, the second group is identified with the caring economy. I say that as a woman and as somebody who has been a carer. We have a huge number of people who may not be drawing a wage but who make a huge contribution. We know the many carers in this country are worth almost €2 billion to the economy. They do incredible work. In terms of demographics, we probably are moving to a more caring economy where there is less work and more caring in the home. It is incredibly important that we put those people and communities and those types of families at the very heart of a just transition. That is not an easy proposition but it is one that is well worth doing.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_736">I am glad to have initiated the structures, provisional as they are, for just transition. Important principles have been already established, such as the hypothecation of carbon tax, the just transition commissioner, the dialogue that has been at the heart of the process in the midlands, the local authority-centred partnership that has been so important in driving programmes and the various programme calls in all sorts of areas of human need. I hope the experience of that interim approach will inform the Bill and our building upon that for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> However, this is on a day when we see new global evidence that our planet is burning as we speak and we are not doing enough to stop it, with concentrations of CO2, sea levels and heat and acidity in the oceans all reaching new levels of deterioration in today's reports. On such a day, it is essential that we recognise that climate action and just transition must be two sides of the same coin. They are not separate things; they are absolutely two sides of the same coin. Just transition is about helping people to make a transition, not compensating them for the cost of unsustainable emitting activities. That is an important principle - this is about making the transition. It is about different toolboxes for different areas of human activity. It will be very different in agriculture and travel than it will be in heating, and it will be different again in industries that are acutely impacted by changes in fossil fuel.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> It is my belief - I have said it often and I will say it again - that adopting a circular economy perspective is really helpful in getting different sectors to evolve the sort of partnership that sees action and just transition in the same light. The circular economy approach emphasises environmental damage over the entire supply chain. As it is no secret that 80% of the environmental damage is baked in at design stage, it is in those early conceptions of what this is about and how we meet our travel or building needs that the mistakes are made. It also emphasises that nearly half of all our emissions come not from fossil fuel use directly but from material use. Therefore, if we can economise on the way we manage our resources to keep them in circulation and reuse and refurbish them, we can make a huge impact. It is really important and that circular approach emphasises that. It stresses particularly opportunities that will emerge from delivering our travel or heating needs or our needs for nourishment in a way that is sustainable. That creates new and sometimes different opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> I will give the Minister an example, and I better keep an eye on the clock. Accenture estimates that 98% of the environmental damage of land travel can be got rid of if we do three simple things, namely, to move from selling products in the form of vehicles that lie idle in our driveways to selling travel as a service, to electrify our fleet and to apply circular principles to material use. It is extraordinary if we rethink, and that is what the circular economy offers the chance to do. Our challenge is how are we going to have prosperous farms, competitive businesses, connected communities and fulfilling opportunities in a world that is net zero? Those who come into this House and try to pretend that the practices and infrastructures of the past, which got us into this whole situation, are ones that are sustainable are doing their constituents an enormous bad service. They are locking them into a way that does not allow us to achieve what we need to do. It is easy to blame big data, big oil, China, fracking or some other person in a black hat for what is going wrong. It is us who must make changes. We are one of the highest emitting countries in the world. We need to make changes. Failing to act now means that it will be harder in the future. Worse still, however, it will be our future generations who will pay for our unwillingness to confront the issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_740">First, I will respond if I may. It is important that some very valid points have been made by members of Government parties and, indeed, by the Opposition as well. I am giving my own perspective to the Government as somebody who lives on a dairy farm in the very heart of rural Ireland in the constituency of Cork East. There are significant worries about some aspects of what the Government is planning. It is important for us to address those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> I am also speaking from the perspective of a young person looking at what we need to do to adapt our economy to make our it more sustainable and promote more sustainable practices when it comes to things like energy generation. When it comes to a just transition, one particular point referencing agriculture is that I really feel we need to do more to address that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> I am very excited about the work has been undertaken in collaboration with the Attorney General around the reforms of the planning process. There is serious urgency around the need to adapt how energy is generated in Ireland from a security point of view, however, which we definitely will see as being a major problem later in this calendar year. I know the Minister has been doing work on that particular matter. It is also from the point of view of sustainable practices. I have a request of the Minister in his portfolio, through the funds he has made available. An important point is we need to put additional funding in place. When it comes to dairy farming in this country, which, may I say, is one sector I believe is under attack, those involved want to invest to a greater extent in more sustainable practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">One key area is energy generation, and helping dairy farmers, in some degree or fashion, to become more climate friendly and adapt to change in our world.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> Ireland is a world leader in food security and in 2023, one of the major focal points of work done by governments everywhere will involve ensuring that enough food is produced to feed the entire population of the world. Of course, the situation in Ukraine has exacerbated concerns about global food shortages. We need to ensure, therefore, that we are making prudent changes in areas that will not harm food production in this country while also addressing the challenges Deputy Bruton eloquently outlined in his contribution regarding the need to do what is right. As a young person, I fully agree with him, but when it comes to the finance that is available, we must help people in rural Ireland to adapt to that change. It is just too expensive for many of them to get rid of their diesel cars, for example, and purchase electric vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> Another issue I have raised repeatedly with the Minister, of which I would like him to take note, relates to the need for a scheme to be put in place immediately such that a family that buys a diesel or petrol vehicle will know what is going to be in place to five or six years in order that they will have certainty to plan for that change. I live in the general Youghal area, a town of 8,000 people, yet I can count on one hand the electric vehicle points in the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> This gives an idea of the change we need to undertake, and the Government needs to lead in this area. We need to lead by example, put the funding in place and work with local authorities. Energy security and energy generation is one area on which we are not doing enough. It is exciting to see the work undertaken by the Attorney General to reform the planning process, which will help us increase the level of renewable energy generated in Ireland. As somebody living in the south of the country, I know that there is significant economic opportunity for people working in agriculture who have suitable land to earn money from the generation of electricity. Approximately 50 acres of solar panels can generate almost €100,000 per annum, in some estimates. That gives an idea of what members of the agricultural community could make by investing in solar and renewable energy, and we need to do more work in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_747">My position on the so-called just transition has been clear since the process was announced. My major concern is that Government policy is destroying jobs by escalating a process that simply cannot and will not deliver what it promises without significant damage to local economies, particularly in Offaly and Laois. This is reckless of the Government, not least in the absence of alternatives or permanent, sustainable jobs. I have made a detailed submission to the consultation on the EU Just Transition Fund and the development of a draft territorial just transition plan in February and I again outlined these concerns, which I have done on many occasions since the just, or unjust, transition process was announced. We are still no closer to knowing when the fabled €84 million in EU moneys will become available, and the Government needs to step up to the mark with that. Under no circumstances should our economies in Laois and Offaly suffer because of poor decision-making, ill judgment and the imposition of an unjust transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> Of course, the transition process cannot be separated from the Government's wider carbon mitigation and reduction strategy and the new European Green Deal. Astronomical costs are associated with the implementation of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, which will cost €180 billion between 2021 and 2030. It is crazy what is happening and is allowed to go on every day. It remains my view that this legislation is regressive and will only compound the difficulties of counties such as Laois and Offaly, which will certainly bear the brunt of the transition process. Indeed, Offaly will suffer 38% of the job losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> I remain unconvinced about the entire rationale for the transition process and the so-called need to utterly transform the rural economy on the basis of a calculation of need and urgency that simply does not stand up to non-ideological scrutiny. The Government is ignoring other research that exists.</p>

          <p eId="para_750">I am afraid the Minister's understanding of a just transition is very different from mine and that of many other people. He kicked up a hullabaloo a number of weeks ago regarding the sale of turf. Given the small volume of turf being sold in the country, that he prioritised it in such a way hurt many people in my county, Kerry, where many people have traditionally cut turf over the years to keep themselves warm.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> In a way, I have to thank the Minister. Many people realise there is trouble afoot and that fuel and heating oil is getting very expensive, and they have gone back to the bogs this year because they do not want to be cold on Christmas night or to have nothing in the hearth to keep themselves warm. Many of them, therefore, have returned to cutting turf. If the Minister left people alone, the practice would die out in any event because the next generation, or perhaps the generation after that, would not cut any turf. Instead, he is trying to force people into electric cars, without sufficient infrastructure, and closing Bord na Móna. Every day since that began, the cost of electricity has increased. The Government has no alternative in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> As for the retrofitting scheme, the Government is offering grants of €25,000 when people do not have the matching money to come up with €25,000 or €30,000 more. Elderly people have only so much time on their side and the Government could give smaller grants for insulation, yet they say they are denied that. If they have ever got so much as €300 or €400 in the past 20 years by way of a grant, they will be ruled out of getting any grants now. Likewise, carbon tax has no effect on the circumstances in which we find ourselves and only hurts people.</p>

          <p eId="para_753">In the Minister's constituency, only 6% of the electorate rely on fossil fuels, so it is easy for him to talk about a "just transition". He might be familiar with the television series "Star Trek" and the line "Beam me up, Scotty", but his just transition is beaming him from place to another and there is no transition for the person who has no alternatives. A total of 700,000 houses rely on fossil fuels, equating to approximately 3 million people, and Minister talks about a just transition. A just transition is about giving people a choice and an alternative to move from one option to another, but first they have to be given alternatives, not ultimatums.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> Did the Minister know that his own Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, chaired by Deputy Leddin from Limerick, has refused to meet representatives from the biofuel industry, which could reduce emissions in this country by using biofuel mixed with home heating oil? It would cut emissions by 50% until we find an alternative. Did he know that Euro 6 engines, in which we asked him to invest, could be filled with biofuel, which would reduce emissions by 10%? He has refused to let the representatives appear before the committee. He is not looking for alternatives; he is looking for his way or no way, and it is not a just transition. He does not see any alternatives except what is in his own little world. A just transition involves bringing people along and giving them alternatives. We have alternatives to lower emissions but he will not even let the representatives appear before the committee. That is wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_755">I am sharing time with Deputy Connolly.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> There is no doubt that we are in need of a just transition in order to ensure a better quality of life for everyone in this country and across the globe.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">If we care about the future of this planet, we need to transition to a zero-carbon economy either immediately or as quickly as we can. The effects of climate change are already being felt across this planet and it will not be long until we are fully feeling them here.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> We need to do all we can to stop this process before it is too late or, at this stage, to slow it down because solving the problem is no longer possible. However, we cannot do this at anyone’s expense. The average citizen should not be taking the hit for this transition. Large corporations have been the biggest culprits in causing this climate devastation. They have a debt to pay to the planet and its people, especially those from the global south, who have felt the greatest effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> Unfortunately, the transition process in Ireland has been overwhelmingly negative. Extraordinary sacrifices have been made by the likes of peat workers, more than 1,000 of whom lost their jobs and received no support from the Government afterwards. Despite this, the Government wonders why people in rural Ireland are so against climate policies. As Hall and Oates might have put it: you are out of touch and we are out of time. We need to ensure that all those who lose their jobs due to transition are offered support and replacement jobs immediately or that something is put in place to make that happen. Until this is addressed, the transition process will only become synonymous with job loss and lower living standards. We do not have time to delay this any further.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> I support the Just Transition Alliance’s call to establish a national just transition commission. This would help in creating replacement jobs and in creating a more sustainable society. We need to protect rural communities in Donegal and in the midlands in particular who have experienced the greatest loss by ensuring job retention and a high standard of living. The problem is that climate change is quickly becoming associated with loss, whether the loss of jobs, of communities or of the ability to live pretty equally. That is not what it should mean for people but there is a real danger that we are making this happen and losing people right away.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> I also support the Just Transition Alliance’s call for a strategy that ensures a maximum retention of key energy assets in public ownership and the call to officially designate energy as an essential public good. We cannot achieve our aim of a just transition without the public ownership of energy assets. Keeping these assets in public ownership will ensure greater power and greater accountability for a sustainable transition. The west coast of Ireland is going to be the location for the solutions, and rightly so, but they will be handed over to private bodies. At best, we will gain some tax revenue from them. That is the best we can hope for.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> It is also important that it be a core policy priority of Government to guarantee access to affordable energy. We can only ensure this by making sure that energy is treated as an essential public good like drinking water and education. We need to live up to the just transition pledge that we signed up to at COP26. The time for talking is over; we need action now.</p>

          <p eId="para_763">I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate. I support the setting up of a just transition commission. How we deal with a just transition will be the measure of whether we are serious about climate change. I am fully with the Minister with regard to climate change. I have said this on the record repeatedly. However, our record in this area is, at the most benign, one of extreme tardiness. On 9 May 2019, we declared a climate and biodiversity emergency. That was not a proactive move on the part of the Government. In July of the following year, the Supreme Court quashed the 2017 mitigation plan because it fell short of the level of specificity required to provide that transparency and to comply with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. In his speech on the budget, the Minister for Finance told us that the world is burning. There has been report after report. The sixth report of the IPCC is absolutely damning. I will not go into the statistics within it.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> Let us look at what we are talking about here. Some rural Deputies feel that their areas are being left out. I have the privilege of representing a city and a rural area and I know this division is absolutely detrimental to our solidarity and our approach to climate change. This was not helped by the recent announcement that the sale of turf is to be stopped when 23% of the homes in County Galway use turf-fired central heating. That type of idiocy, which leads to more and more division, is simply unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> We are penalising the people on the ground who have actually led us on sustainability. I have mentioned this about Galway so often that it now bores people. The people of Galway led on recycling 20 years ago but the power was taken away from them. Instead of building on such initiatives, we have listed decarbonisation zones throughout the country, which is brilliant. These are sitting in the Department or in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. There has been no movement at all on this or on a feasibility study for light rail in Galway. There has also been no movement with regard to park-and-ride facilities in Galway. This has been in the plan since 2005. I could go on and on. There have been absolutely no practical measures on the ground. There is an opportunity to make Galway a green and lean city as its population increases by 50% with a light rail system or at least a feasibility study in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_766"> There has been no attempt at all to look at what we are doing with the big corporations and the data centres. Perhaps the Minister could read his correspondence afterwards because I have only a few seconds of his attention. The biggest problem for me is the marketisation of everything. I will mention a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> about Scotland. A big player in the fashion industry has bought up 210,000 acres on 12 estates in Scotland with a view to trading his emissions from the fashion industry. If that is this Government's way forward, I will have no part of it.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Eamon Ryan)<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_767">I very much appreciate the contributions of the various Deputies. That characteristic of listening to each other and coming to a common understanding of what we should do next is going to be essential in the development of a statutory just transition commission. I hear the various concerns from across the country, which are many, varied and valid. We have to create a system that is flexible, fast and effective. I agree with Deputy Hourigan's point that the example of the Scottish and Welsh Governments, which have established statutory just transition commissions that have such characteristics, gives us a model and an approach we can take as we go forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> I will also reflect on what Deputy Bruton said in his contribution. He put in place a system with regard to the establishment of the just transition commissioner, Kieran Mulvey, and work has been done in the midlands in the last three or four years in respect of both the dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of Bord na Móna, which is now expanding and has a very bright future as it moves from brown to green, as its own strategy describes it, and the support and development of a whole variety of new enterprise community development projects, which have been funded through our just transition fund. These will bear real fruit and are a good example of how we can make this transition work in a way that is just and which provides prosperity, security and well-being for our people. The work there must continue, particularly in light of the application of the EU Just Transition Fund and the work of Offaly County Council and the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly with our Department and the just transition commissioner to roll out further funding and achieve further progress in that regard. That is critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> The Government absolutely recognises that this highly important midlands project is only the first of the projects that will be needed to ensure a just transition in the climate change leap we need to make. In the climate action plan Government launched last October, it committed to the establishment of a statutory office for the just transition commissioner. We are now setting out to deliver on that commitment and to provide for that office. It is envisaged that approval for the remit of the commission will be sought by the middle of this year, as was committed to in that climate action plan. Following that Government approval, my Department and I will develop the general scheme of the legislation that will put the commission on a statutory footing. Preparatory work has already started on that. I will outline one of the aspects that I think is important, which goes back to what I said at the start about consultation and the involvement of a whole range of actors in society in addition to parties and individual Deputies in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> By way of the climate action plan, the national development plan and the Housing for All strategy, we have plans in place that have real substance and the right strategic direction and scale of ambition. However, our focus now must be on delivery. To assist that delivery and make sure it is accelerated, particularly in the coming two to three years, the Government is setting up a number of acceleration task forces or leadership groups within different Departments. This will help to ensure we apply some of the same flexibility and urgency we saw in how we managed the Covid crisis and Brexit to how we meet the climate change challenge. The acceleration and leadership groups will work in the areas of offshore wind, sustainable mobility, the heating of residential buildings, how we communicate climate action and how we manage our land use review, which is critical to the future development of forestry, farming, biodiversity protection and the development of carbon storage in our country. It also is my intention to establish an acceleration team to help us with the roll-out of the just transition change we need to make and the development of the legislation on the remit and scope of the just transition commission office.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> Officials in my Department and I had a very productive meeting last week with Kieran Mulvey. I am very glad that Mr. Mulvey has agreed to stay on for an additional year to help us in this process and inform the work we are doing. He has the experience of the midlands project and, indeed, experience from his career in mediation, industrial relations and trade union activities in this country. The acceleration teams will need a wider focus. I am looking forward to meeting with the various NGOs and trade unions with an interest in this area, as well as the secretariat of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which has done extensive work in looking at best-case international practice as to how just transition commissions can be established and how they can work. We will also be working with other Departments on this. The Department of the Taoiseach will have a key role as a co-ordinating Department that provides oversight and real leadership, which will help the acceleration teams. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, other Departments and outside agencies will also be involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> Critically, the first meeting of the national climate dialogue forum took place two months ago in Dublin Castle. It is based on a partnership model, with input from representatives of business, trade unions, NGOs, community organisations and the National Youth Council of Ireland regarding the approach we are taking to tackling climate change. Most people involved recognised that it was a very successful and useful meeting. The closing session committed us to come back in the summer months and to provide real progress in terms of how the acceleration teams will work. As part of that, I expect to be able to bring to the national climate dialogue forum and to Government the general scheme of the legislation, which my Department is working on, setting out the mandate, purpose and structure of a statutory just transition commission office. I want to listen to people's views because that is what works well in this country. As a smaller country, we have the ability to listen to different voices, in this House and beyond. I am looking forward to that engagement. The ongoing meetings of the national climate dialogue forum will allow us to provide updates and checks in terms of what is happening and what the just transition commission office is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> It is vital that we follow this approach and that there is social justice in the changes we make. That requires clear participation, listening and evidence-based research. As the Minister of State outlined in his opening address, the principles that have been set out for achieving a just transition are valid, well tested and need to be delivered. If there is not a just transition approach, the change that is needed will not happen quickly enough and we will not have public support. It is vital that the leap we make is towards a better system. This is not about technology for its own sake. We will not make it if it is just about emissions targets, critical as it is that we meet all of them. It has to be about moving towards a better system, for example, in transport. As Deputy Bruton said, it is possible to reimagine how we use materials and how we create a circular economy. It is also about reimagining how we see the future of Irish farming. Most of the people I meet in that sector recognise that the future is not clear enough for young people. We do not have a new generation of people going into farming. We are seeing ever greater intensification, larger holdings and a real threat and risk to the Irish family farm. I do not think we want that. As Deputy O'Connor mentioned, part of a just transition must be to look at what the future might be for Irish farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> When it comes to energy, we know that the only just transition will be a renewable and efficient one. Relying on fossil fuels is at the expense of the people of our country and will lead to a hugely expensive, fraught and at-risk future. The energy transition will be easier than other transitions because we have an alternative in our own natural resources. Deputy Pringle is correct that there will be private sector involvement in that, but it will be State-led. The design and roll-out of the entire system will have to be led by the State because this is a transition that will take place over 30, 40 or 50 years and it will happen at massive scale. Only the State can do that. It can only be done, and it will be done, for the good and benefit of the Irish people. It will require a series of governments to take us in this direction, rather than being a stop-start process. That is why we need dialogue. We must listen to each other and have a sharing of understanding as to why having a just transition as central to this whole process is vital. I again thank the Deputies for their contributions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_775">I welcome this important Bill, which will streamline the process for gardaí to receive compensation when they suffer malicious injuries in the course of their duties. We all appreciate that members of An Garda Síochána have a dangerous job. We have a responsibility to ensure they are protected as much as possible while working and that they are compensated fairly when those protections fail. Under the current legislation, any garda seeking compensation for malicious injury must first approach the Minister for Justice and, if his or her approval is given, may then go to the High Court. It is an incredibly inefficient system in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> It is important to note that compensation is the end result of a malicious injury. Obviously, every effort should be made to ensure protections are provided as much as possible on the job. I keep going back to the ratio of gardaí to population. As I have said before, County Meath has the worst ratio in the country, followed by County Kildare, both of which are areas that have grown in population but where services have not grown in tandem. I am aware of members of An Garda Síochána turning up to incidents on their own, which sometimes puts them in harm's way. That really must be factored into the deployment of resources, which I know is outside my remit and that of the Minister. It is wholly the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. However, it is important to reiterate that there must be sufficient resources to ensure gardaí are protected. I am aware of gardaí who have felt at risk on occasion because of the inadequacy of the protection afforded to them, but who felt they had to respond to a call. When we are talking about compensation, we must be sure to remember the importance of trying to make sure injuries do not occur in the first place or minimising the risk of them happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> Between legal fees and administrative costs, going to the High Court is a huge financial burden and not something any of us would relish doing. Gardaí who have been injured and the families of deceased gardaí have enough on their plate without facing that burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">The compensation afforded by the High Court in these cases is quite inconsistent and highly dependent on the judge presiding in the case. That is unsatisfactory and it is part of the reason the Minister is bringing this Bill forward. Moving to a system where the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, will be dealing with this will go a long way towards standardising the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> It has always struck me as strange how we separate particular categories of workers, and gardaí have been a case in point in terms of the processes afforded to them in comparison to those afforded to people who work in other sectors. Another example of this practice is the exclusion of gardaí from the Unfair Dismissals Act. It was only in 2020 that an external dispute mechanism was set up to give gardaí access to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court. Moving the system to the PIAB is another improvement and it will reduce the cost burden and the emotional energy for the person who has been injured, as well as being a saving to the State. Legal representation is optional for the PIAB, which will lower the cost on the individual. The Book of Quantum used in the PIAB will also ensure a consistency in payouts. That is quite an important element. It is important that the PIAB takes into consideration the psychological impact of the type of injury we are discussing in this legislation. There can be a major difference between somebody having an accident in the workplace and somebody being attacked. There can be psychological consequences for a person who is attacked and who has to rebuild his or her confidence. It is a fundamentally different thing. If claimants are unhappy with the outcome of their case, they can progress to the courts. However, it is to be hoped that the process will drastically reduce the number of cases that go to the courts. That is also a bonus in terms of freeing up court time.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> The new process is also a much faster system. It will reduce the overall length of time it takes for members of the Garda Síochána or their families to receive compensation as a result of injury or death. The current system has done a disservice to members of the Garda Síochána and their families in this regard. The last thing one wishes to do if one has been injured at work is to go through expensive, drawn-out legal proceedings where there is an unknown quantity associated with it in terms of the compensation to which the person might be entitled. It is welcome to see trainee gardaí brought under the new scheme. It is recognition that the trainees do policing work like other gardaí. We saw that during the pandemic when the trainee gardaí were deployed across the country. They were under supervision, but they were still out carrying out patrols, at checkpoints and so forth. If anything demonstrates that they should be included, that does. There is no question that they face the same risk in the course of their duties as a fully-fledged member of the Garda Síochána. It is right that they are included.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> The exclusion of the civilian staff from the scheme is baffling. It would be useful to hear the Minister's reasoning in that regard. I am aware that it was raised by other Members of the House when they spoke on the Bill yesterday and that it was also raised in the Seanad. We will probably have an increasing number of those staff who will be doing different types of work, for example, in the area of cyber crime, that is more desk-based. If somebody comes into a Garda station and there is an attack at the front counter and the person happens to be there, it is hard to see how one can differentiate and how that person would not be included. The Minister might outline what the route for the civilian staff will be. Am I missing something in that regard in that they are already provided for? It would be useful to hear the Minister's response. In the proposed policing, security and community safety Bill, the Government is proposing to bring civilian staff under the investigative remit of the body that will replace the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, with the same level of scrutiny as is given to members of the Garda Síochána. This shows that it is not just about administrative work. If the Minister is using that logic, it would be useful to understand why they are differentiated when it comes to a claim for malicious injury.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> Those are the two main points I wish to make. One is the civilian staff and why there is a differentiation. The second is that I cannot reiterate enough the importance of making sure we provide a safe working environment. That safe working environment is related to the deployment of resources. I would appreciate it if the Minister could raise that yet again with the Garda Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> It will be quite interesting to see what emerges from the new census of population. I have no doubt that Meath, Kildare and, perhaps, Fingal will be leading the charge in terms of the numerical changes, if areas are going to change dramatically. I had a look at the profile of growth between 1996 and 2016 and those three areas are the areas that did the heavy lifting, with a growth rate of approximately 40% in all three. That was phenomenal. It is impossible to have that type of growth rate if the other services are not keeping pace. We are already behind by virtue of the fact that we are five years after a census of population, but there has to be some provision to ensure that areas are properly resourced and, as a consequence of that, people are kept safer in work in this type of environment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Cathal Crowe<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_784">The Garda Síochána (Compensation) Bill 2021 is very positive legislation and I fully support it. Essentially, the Bill is aimed at decreasing the length of time it takes for disposing of a Garda compensation claim from initial application to award by providing for clear time limits in respect of each stage of the process. The new process is also aimed at ensuring that avenues for settlement and resolution are available at the earliest possible stage and that cases do not end up before the courts and are not necessarily dealt with by the High Court when the amount claimed in compensation could be dealt with in a lower court. Provisions for legal cost penalties for failure to settle or for choosing the wrong level of court will now apply to Garda compensation claims in the same way as they apply to other personal injury actions. It is a good legislative measure. I have followed the debate this afternoon and yesterday and I do not expect that it will meet too much opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> It concerns me greatly that the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation still has not yet properly dealt with and progressed the investigation relating to the suspension of eight members of An Garda Síochána in the Limerick division. The Limerick division encompasses a considerable amount of County Clare, which I represent. A population area of approximately 12,000 people is policed by the Limerick Garda division. It is a great concern that eight members of that division have been on suspension with pay since November 2020, with the matter being before the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. In total, more than 100 gardaí have been brought in for questioning, more than 60 telephones have been confiscated and, as I said, eight members remain suspended. One of the suspended members gave an anonymous quote to the <i>Irish Examiner</i> quite recently: "Our lives are ripped apart ... Our mental health has been in tatters ... [Me and my colleagues] are in a state of distress". There is nothing worse than to have a net of suspicion hanging over one.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">Whether it is right or wrong, this investigation needs to move on because the force is disadvantaged by it. The eight personnel would be very much appreciated on the beat in the community. I am sure there are other services behind the scenes, administrative supports within An Garda Síochána to which these people could be assigned, rather than have them sitting at home wallowing in the despair that this has brought them to.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> It is not my job to be judge and jury, but it is my job to highlight the issue - I do not get many opportunities to speak on this issue because of the separation of powers - but it certainly is not moving fast enough. The genesis of this goes all the way back to 1922, a century ago, when An Garda Síochána was formed. Every single intake of trainee gardaí have been told about L7, the power of discretion. It applies in so many contexts. A garda, in a moment, can decide how he or she should act and apply the law. It is especially relevant insofar as the Road Traffic Act is concerned. We have all been there. We have all been driving from point A to point B, possibly against the clock, and we have exceeded the speed limit on a particular section of roadway. If we are pulled over by the gardaí in that moment, when the window is rolled down and we speak to a garda, most people offer an excuse and explain - sometimes it is inexcusable of course, but sometimes it could be a trip to a maternity hospital or for any number of reasons, some of them valid and others absolutely invalid - but a garda in that moment has the power to exercise L7, the power of discretion, to cross out or square off the traffic offence there and then. That has been taught since the inception of the force way back in 1922. The power of discretion is the most powerful power a garda has, but it is not defined. It has no definition. Discretion is what it is. The Minister might have a different discretion to mine. It is the power of an individual in the moment to decide the rights and wrongs and to apply in a sensible, logical way a piece of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> What has happened in the Limerick Garda division is the higher echelons of An Garda Síochána believe this to fall in the realm of abuse and corruption and they have launched a major investigation into it. Perhaps some of that is right and some of it is wrong. We need to move beyond this stage. When someone is pulled over, it should not matter who he or she is or how he or she ranks in public life, or in any respect. This is not about squaring off a road traffic offence for a county hurler, the monsignor or the local Deputy. This is about having reasonable discretion in a moment to decide where the rights and wrongs are. When this investigation got under way, some of the gardaí were straight out of Templemore. They had been in their lecture rooms and then they were on the beat and they were suddenly brought into a net of suspicion and involved in an investigation. Some 100 of them were brought in and questioned. The investigation remains unresolved. It has hampered career progression. There has been a cloud of suspicion over them. Many gardaí who wanted to transfer to their home area cannot do so because they are part of this investigation, which simply has not concluded. Their personal phones and laptops were taken from them. It has been damaging and harrowing to their families. Some of the gardaí were unable to speak to me when I contacted them, but I did speak with wives, husbands and partners who were able to tell me just how devastating this is. Some of them are on antidepressants.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> If nothing else, in the public interest, I urge that the Minister would speak with Commissioner Harris and ask him to move the investigation on. I raised it with him at a joint policing committee in Clare at the turn of the year. He was limited in what he could say in that forum, but he did commit to moving this on. That is all we can ask for here today. We cannot ask for outcomes, but we ask that the investigation would be moved on. The public are disadvantaged. An Garda Síochána is disadvantaged. Am I over time or am I in my final minute?</p>

          <p eId="para_793">What Commissioner Harris has brought to An Garda Síochána is a different style of policing. He came from the PSNI which has a more robust form of policing: it is not policing by consent that we have had here for the past century. When the PSNI drives through a community, their vehicles are armoured and protected, which is not the case with An Garda Síochána, who tonight are out training local sports teams involved in the community. They rely on that community engagement to be able to solve crimes and gather evidence at times of need. I do not believe the model Commissioner Harris has tried to bring south of the Border has worked effectively. The situation I have outlined is a manifestation of this, where the heavy hammer has come down. Not only are we asking whether it is right or wrong, but we have suspended gardaí. We have 100 of them under investigation and it is not moving on. I plead with the Minister to do her best and to pick up the phone to the Commissioner tomorrow. Thank you for you forbearance, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_794">I am very pleased to speak on this Bill today, which I welcome. It is an important update and a new approach to managing compensation claims. Last week, I was at the Dún Laoghaire Garda station for the centenary celebrations. A significant number of members and retired members were there, including those getting long-service awards. There was a fantastic exhibition of the history of An Garda Síochána which included the different artefacts they used over the period, including different uniforms and weapons that were in use. It was a moment to reflect on the history of An Garda Síochána and the bravery with which so many members have approached their work, going out every day in various circumstances in communities with additional difficulties into difficult places and difficult situations. It was a reminder to me of the important role An Garda Síochána plays in every community. I was very pleased to be there.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> The Bill is an important statement of support for An Garda Síochána, its individual members and for the force as a whole. It is an important simplification of the injury management process and the compensation management process for injured members. It also deals with compensation for the families of deceased members and makes life easier for everybody. When somebody has suffered an injury of any kind in work there are so many additional difficulties such as hospital appointments, a new complexity to life, the management of physical pain and the psychological aspect of the injury. Anything that can be done by the State to make life easier for somebody who has incurred an injury in the course of serving the State must be done. This is an important step the Minister has brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> In the context of a deceased member, it is an important and compassionate step to have made things more straightforward for the family. The legislation deals with the management of the compensation. Could a contemporaneous piece of work be done to provide psychological and emotional supports to people who have received injuries, in anticipation of the sort of additional psychological support some but not all might need? It is easy to anticipate that an injury is more complex than simply being physical. It would be a wonderful statement to proactively anticipate the mental health side of any injury and to put the arm around a member of An Garda Síochána who has suffered an injury and to anticipate that the injury may not just be physical.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> This is an important year for An Garda Síochána, given the centenary. I started by looking back, but when I was in Dún Laoghaire last week I was thinking very much about the future of An Garda Síochána and the future of the developing State. I thought about it from two perspectives: first, the development of the State geographically and how much building there has been, essentially how many new towns are being developed. The Minister will forgive me for mentioning again the necessity for a Garda station at the developing town of Cherrywood, which has a population of 30,000 people. You will forgive me for raising this again, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I am aware of the pressure that will be placed on the area due to the population influx. It is also a developing State in terms of our understanding of mental injury in particular and psychological trauma. We understand that so much better and we are better at being able to anticipate that. We must be able to put the structures around mental illness and mental injury that can occur so easily through fear or an occasion of trauma. I refer, for example, to the potential exposure of some members of An Garda Síochána to child exploitation material. All of that is foreseeable and we can anticipate that such incidents might happen. We understand these things better all the time. I ask that they would be on the mind of the Minister's officials as well as we move through this process.</p>

          <p eId="para_798">The Bill seeks to address an unfair situation that exists at the moment where gardaí who are maliciously injured while serving the State are placed at a severe disadvantage in comparison to civilian claimants. Currently, gardaí who sustain injuries have to apply for authorisation from the Department of Justice to seek compensation in the High Court, regardless of the scale of the damages sought. This places an unnecessary cost burden on gardaí at a time when the State should be supporting them. Current claims must also be lodged within three months of a malicious incident. This legislation will extend the timeframe to six months, although in many cases the general public have up to two years to lodge a claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The requirement through apply to the High Court is overly cumbersome. Under this new Bill, a nominated reporting officer, who will be appointed by the Garda Commissioner, will decide on the eligibility of claims. There will be a formal review process for claimants who have been refused. It is a principle of natural justice that a right of appeal should be available, and this is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> This Bill will also include trainee gardaí, who the current legislation does not cover. If enacted, it will allow for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, to assess claims using its usual quantum system. This is an important step because it removes the need for our gardaí to incur expensive legal costs so that they can get what they are entitled to.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> We in Sinn Féin have concerns over the term "malicious intent". It needs to be clarified that gardaí are covered for injuries that are sustained in traffic accidents, as well as for other injuries that occur in the course of their duty, where the garda has not contributed to the cause of their injury but where maliciousness is involved. This is something of a grey area.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> Finally, I would like to raise the issue of resources. Our gardaí deserve a workplace that is as safe as possible. The lack of resources is often brought up at our local joint policing committee meetings. We need to fund An Garda Síochána better so that any risks can be mitigated. If An Garda Síochána does not have sufficient numbers, and if its members are working with poor quality or not enough equipment, these can contribute to accidents. In my area we have a situation where they are apparently sharing a garda car. That is probably an issue for another day, but it needs to be addressed. The men and women who put themselves at risk, as well as the general public who rely on them, deserve better.</p>

          <from>Deputy Cathal Berry<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_803">I thank the Minister her opening statement, which she delivered yesterday. I am delighted to be in the Chamber today to contribute to this important debate on the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Bill. I am very happy with this Bill and welcome it. I recognise it is probably long overdue. I am happy to support its passage through the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> I do so for the following reasons. First, I have no problem in saying that I am a big fan of An Garda Síochána. I recognise how difficult and dangerous the work is. For instance, when a scuffle breaks out, most normal people move away from the scene of the incident. Yet, we expect our gardaí to move forward, to intervene and to normalise the situation. Most normal people do not hang around with dangerous drug dealers or with organised criminals. Once again, we expect our gardaí to move forward, to intervene, to confront and to actively seek out these people. We need to recognise that it is a dangerous job. If we are tasking people to do a job, we need to resource them for it. The gardaí and their families need to be aware that we are in their corner when it comes to tackling crime and to safeguarding the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> It is appropriate that we are discussing this topic this year, because the centenary celebrations of An Garda Síochána are taking place. An Garda Síochána has watched over this country for 100 years. It is important we have the appropriate resources and structures in place to look after them. One just has to look at the roll of honour and at the number of gardaí who have been killed in line of duty to recognise how difficult and dangerous their work is.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> I also support this Bill for technical reasons. First, it streamlines, simplifies and speeds up the compensation process for gardaí. This is important. Crucially, from my perspective, the financial compensation will most likely now go almost exclusively to the victim. It will not be lost in layers of bureaucracy or with legal eagles down the tracks. It will go where it is intended to go, whether that is towards the victim or to the victim's family. That is a very important point to get across. </p>
          <p eId="para_807"> Second, I am a big fan of the Personal Injury Assessment Board. I recognise it is an imperfect organisation, but it simplifies the process, and it takes the adversarial component out of a court case. As Deputy Catherine Murphy quite rightly pointed out, it frees up the time for the courts for what they should be doing, rather than dealing with personal injury claims that are caused by malicious intent.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> Everybody wins here. The taxpayer and the gardaí and their families win. The State also wins, because it simplifies the process immeasurably. There is a good sense of balance in the Bill. There are penalties in the Bill that are codified for a very small minority of people who would seek to embellish their injuries or to submit fraudulent claims. There are penalties included and that is important from a deterrent point of view. </p>
          <p eId="para_809"> I just have two questions for the Minister. I would be grateful if she could kindly address them in her closing remarks. I recognise the importance of the garda compensation pathway in the Bill. I understand there is a separate scheme for prison officers. The Irish Prison Service has a separate prison service tribunal. We are hearing anecdotally in the constituency office that the awards for compensation for prison officers are generally much less than they are for members of An Garda Síochána. I would be grateful if the Minister could look into that. Whether a person gets a broken nose or a stab wound, it does not matter what shade of blue they are wearing. If they are a prison officer or if they are a member of An Garda Síochána, the same amount of compensation should be relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> Could the Minister say whether she intends to upgrade the Irish Prison Service compensation pathway, as well as the pathway for An Garda Síochána? That information would be gratefully received by the prison officers. </p>
          <p eId="para_811"> Third, and perhaps the Minister might wish to liaise with her Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, on this, there are members of the Defence Forces who do not have any scheme at all like this. Would this be something the Government would be interested in pursuing or at least researching to see if would it be appropriate? Members of Defence Forces are abroad. They are interacting with rebel agencies, rebel groups, armed criminals and state agencies. Would it be something worth pursuing to take malicious injuries out of the court system and provide a much more streamlined pathway for them?</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> Before I hand over to Deputy Shanahan, I would like to say I welcome this Bill, I am happy to support it and I look forward to its swift implementation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MattShanahan" eId="spk_299">

          <p eId="para_813">I think we would all agree that every functioning democracy needs to have an independent policing authority, a police force to ensure the security of the population and the upholding of our democratic laws and mandates. In Ireland, we are lucky to have An Garda Síochána. It is a force that is recognised across the world for it close ties to community, its professionalism and the fact that most of its members do not carry arms. This is unusual for most police forces across the world. That being said, the shape of our society is changing, as is our culture. Our police force must change also.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> The role of the gardaí on the beat has changed quite dramatically, particularly for those who are now stationed in our larger urban towns and cities. Unfortunately, threats to the lives and limbs of our gardaí, which would not have been commonplace over past decades, are commonplace today. Unfortunately, we have far more pervasive crime, as the Minister knows, particularly in relation to the drugs trade in Ireland. Any garda who is single-handedly trying to interrupt the activities of drug gangs for their profits is certainly taking a chance with their personal safety and well-being. </p>
          <p eId="para_815"> In addition, violence against gardaí on the beat has increased. It has been driven by both criminal activities and increased antisocial behaviour. Many gardaí now unfortunately face the possibility of physical injury at the hands of others when they are trying to make arrests, possibly late at night, or when they are trying to interrupt a crime. In recent years, when gardaí are exposed to car chases, the ramming of garda cars by fleeing suspects has become all too prevalent. Gardaí are often called to many domestic abuse situations, which can tragically escalate out of control. This was seen with the death of the garda Tony Golden in 2015 and similarly with the death of Adrian Donohoe at the Lordship credit union, when he had been protecting cash that was in transit. These, as we all know, were crimes that would not have been thought about in this country possibly 30 or 40 years ago. We need to ensure that in such circumstances and situations, where family members or dependents are left, they must receive compensation as quickly as possible and with the least amount of legal adversity as possible. I know the Minister is trying to pursue this.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> There are few jobs of which I know that carry the risk of assault, car accident, personal attack or injury as being a possibility every day you go to work. That is a fact of life for people in An Garda Síochána. Given this environment, it is only right that we should have a comprehensive garda compensation policy for members of the force when they suffer injury, let alone death, in the course of their duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> In light of personal injury assessment, I am glad the Minister has included in her Bill the estimation of personal injuries compensation to be considered by PIAB. As the Minister knows, PIAB is building significant expertise in this area and it has been doing so for a number of years. It now has an agreed book of quantum to regulate costs and to ensure a speedy assessment and grant of compensatory moneys. </p>
          <p eId="para_818">It is to be hoped this will speed up claims that are pending. I also welcome Part 7 of the Bill, where it has been highlighted compensation will not be liable for the purposes of calculating income tax and notes the exclusion of awards from certain assessments of pensions. This is only right. In fact, compensation is not being seen as a windfall for anybody who is getting it, but something that is a means to compensate people for injury and loss they have suffered.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> I will also ask the Minister about the issue of post-traumatic stress disorder. I am not sure where it is in the Bill, although I know it is there in respect of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. Post-traumatic stress disorder does and will befall many members of An Garda Síochána as a result of assault and injuries suffered and in the course of duties where they have been witnesses to assault, kidnapping and battery and, sometimes, violence and murder. Although we are talking about Garda compensation relating to assaults on gardaí, this is an area the courts will have to look at because the attitudes to taking on and assaulting gardaí have changed. I am aware of this in my town and in my circles. I see it on the beat and most gardaí will tell you that. The deference that was widely offered to the Garda for many years in this country does not exist to the same extent anymore. Therefore, the actions of the courts must prove a deterrent to any considered assault of a garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> Regarding the welfare of gardaí in the course of their duty and how the State provides adequate facilities for that purpose, I will speak for a moment about our divisional headquarters in Waterford. I was happy to welcome the Minister to Waterford in recent days. She was well received and met with the new policing body there. I presume she also saw our divisional headquarters. She will also have seen the cramped and inadequate space available to our Waterford divisional headquarters. I hope she took significant notice of the lack of office space, the lack of interrogation rooms and the lack of changing rooms and locker room facilities for Garda members. I am sure these deficits were not lost on her during her tour of that divisional unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> As she knows, we have spent a lot of money in this country upgrading Garda headquarters, sometimes at a cost of tens of millions. I hope somebody pointed out to the Minister there is potential to add significantly to the footprint in Waterford for probably €3 million to €5 million. I ask her to bring this matter up with the Commissioner, if that is where it has to go, to get investment. As she knows, Waterford headquarters is the command and control centre for the south-eastern command and control rooms, which monitor all emergency activities in the region. To be fair, I have seen operators there operating cheek by jowl. There is hardly room for a pen on a desk or a peg for a coat. It is not adequate in this day and age and it is not right to ask people to work in those facilities. Although the provision of capital facilities and buildings may not be part of today's immediate discussion, I ask the Minister please to raise this matter with the powers that be to see if we can get money put into divisional headquarters in Waterford. As she knows, its remit has been widened. Additional people are to go there but there is no room to accommodate them and certainly no room to accommodate the additional activity that will take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> Overall, I of course support the activities of An Garda Síochána and its members' rights to adequate compensation for injury or loss in the course of their work. We all want to see a progressive Garda force. We must, therefore, ensure it has a progressive compensation system in place for injury and loss in the course of its members' duties, as might happen to them. I welcome the Bill and I hope to see it progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_823">In the short time available, I will say we support this legislation. It is very important. Gardaí play a crucial role in our society. That has been underlined even more by the support it offered to our communities during the Covid-19 pandemic, but the role it plays in tackling crime has always been apparent and is always something that is crucial. It carries with it enormous dangers and enormous risks. Countless gardaí are injured, often quite seriously, in the course of their duties. This happens while they are attempting to protect the rest of society from criminals and various dangers. It is vitally important we ensure they have confidence they will be supported in the same way they support our communities. It is vitally important they can be satisfied that if something happens to them in the course of discharging their duty of protecting the public, they will be appropriately compensated. That is right and proper and is something I agree with.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> I support the points made by Deputy Berry on prison officers and the Defence Forces. It is vitally important people in those ranks are also properly compensated and supported in the event of any incident. There are issues that need to be addressed, in particular whether "malicious incident" is defined broadly enough to catch everyone who could be in that situation, including trainee gardaí. It is vitally important that is addressed. We expect gardaí to go out there and risk themselves physically to protect us from crime, to tackle some very violent and dangerous criminals and to put themselves in situations, whether those are domestic incidents or whatever, where there is significant risk to them. It is vitally important we ensure they are properly compensated. Therefore, we will support this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> I am meeting with the chief superintendent in Cork in the coming days. One of the things we will discuss is Garda resources in Cork. It has been an ongoing frustration that Cork, despite the fact it is the second largest city in the State, has not got the kind of Garda resources some of the big urban centres have got. Some of our fast-growing areas are way behind in Garda numbers, including places such as Ballincollig, Douglas and Carrigaline. These are places that are growing rapidly but still have a Garda presence that reflects a time when they were little more than villages or small towns. I will address that with the Garda but I also request the Minister raises this matter with the Garda Commissioner at the next opportunity.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Lawless<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_826">I welcome the introduction of the legislation that, as far as I can see, sets out to streamline the process of Garda compensation claims and, in effect, bring them in line with other litigation of a similar nature that goes through our courts. It also seeks to apply some of the improvements and efficiencies this Government has brought in for other similar areas to the process and streamline it in a similar way. It is a very welcome and commonsense provision. It is great to see the Government doing this and bringing it through.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> I note the new PIAB guidelines adopted by the Judicial Council last year are now applicable to Garda claims, which makes eminent sense, because an injury in one walk of life, in effect, has the same impact on somebody's day-to-day operation and prospects etc. as an injury sustained in another walk of life. It makes perfect sense if the same guidelines were to apply. I note what is often called a cost deferential order will be applicable if a claim is initiated in a higher court than the court it is ultimately found to be merited in. If somebody brings a case in the High Court, when it is really a District or Circuit Court case, and incurs additional cost on both sides for doing so, the norm is that person is penalised for doing that, in the sense he or she would have that taken off the award ultimately. Again, it makes perfect sense and is designed to encourage people to litigate in the correct jurisdiction and correct court. That is already done in many other walks of life in the courts. Again, it makes sense to apply those rules here and they are in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> PIAB will have an increased role in the system. Rather than the historical authorisation granted for a Garda compensation claim, I understand PIAB will now process it in the same way as it processes any other personal injuries claim. Again, that makes perfect sense. I note if the assessment is accepted that will be taken on board, which avoids the need for litigation altogether. That is something that has worked quite well in the personal injuries sphere over the past 20 years and this legislation brings it in line with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> While I am on this topic, I will look at the efforts of our Government colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Troy, to reform PIAB further. The Minister of State is looking at making PIAB a quasi-judicial body analogous to the WRC, the Residential Tenancies Board, or some of those bodies that exist that process claims, where oral evidence is submitted and submissions made, but perhaps in a slightly less formal way than in a courtroom and certainly less expensive than a courtroom situation. I commend the Minister of State's efforts in that regard. He is experiencing resistance in some quarters but it is a good idea and maybe something that could be looked at in this context. That would be another way to take some of the cost out of personal injury claims since some of these will also be coming into this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I also note that the State Claims Agency will now be nominated as the official liaison, or the driver, of these claims from a State point of view. Again, it makes perfect sense. That would be the norm with all other litigation against the State, that is, that the State Claims Agency would take carriage of those, rather than the Minister or the Commissioner or somebody being empowered to do so. There may be historical anomalies that are being tidied up in this and it is bringing it into line.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> As many speakers have, I want to salute the work members of the Garda do in terms of putting themselves in harm's way and going into the community. They are very much rooted in the community. We have largely an unarmed force that derives its defence from the respect it enjoys among the population, by and large. They are unarmed, as has been said. They put themselves in harm’s way for our protection, which is something we cannot take for granted. We must respect the role they play.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> The 2020 report told us 200 gardaí were injured in the line of duty. In 2021, it appeared to be 243, so there was an increase last year. That is 243 too many and 200 too many the year before. Unfortunately, this is a pattern. In a way, it goes with the territory, which is not to in any way excuse it or play it down. They are people who for the greater good and to serve the public, the State and this Republic put themselves in harm’s way to defend all of us. We enjoy the protection they grant us. I commend and salute the force for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> While it is just and right that any member of the Garda who is injured in the line of duty should be eligible for compensation, is there an argument for extending that to other areas? I refer to people such as prison officers, who have been mentioned, and the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, officers. There is the concept of authorised officers in much legislation where people may be involved in law enforcement-type activities that may be outside of the scope of this legislation as it is currently constituted. Perhaps they could be brought back in.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> However, I would even go outside the traditional law enforcement bodies. What about teachers, for example? Teachers in a classroom can come up against harm, be that physical or psychological. Unfortunately, it happens. Those experiences are there. There are people in other emergency services, be it ambulance personnel, hospital porters, those in the fire service and in many other areas who put themselves in the firing line in the line of duty. They are not covered by this Bill and I am not sure whether they are covered by any legislation. Without in any way taking from the fine work our Garda do, I wonder why there is a special process for Garda that does not exist for teachers, those in fire services and other emergency personnel. Even in this House, there have been many reports of constituency offices coming under threat. I am thinking of staff in our constituency offices who man the front lines every day, some of whom have been threatened. Thankfully, none have been assaulted to date, touch wood. There are people in many walks of life who serve the public by making themselves available and could face harm doing so. Should we look at broadening this device? If we are going to have a scheme, perhaps it should be a little bit wider. I ask the Minister to consider that.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> It would be remiss of me, as others have done, not to mention the situation in my county, County Kildare. Unfortunately, for a long time, it had the dubious distinction of having the fewest number of Garda members <i>per capita</i> in the country in terms of the number of personnel serving in Kildare. We have, thankfully, received additional recruits. However, we need that sort of stellar leap. In terms of the <i>pro rata</i> number every other county gets, we are still behind. We were traditionally resourced as a sort of outpost of Dublin. There were a couple of rural barracks back in the day of Robert Peel and beyond. We are now very much in the greater Dublin area with possibly the third highest population of any county. We are very much a built-up urban conglomerate, but we have not had that injection of resources to match that in terms of the demographics and population. I know it is an operational issue for the Garda Commissioner, but I would ask the Minister to take note of that. In any discussions where it might arise, it is something I continually beat the drum on.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">We welcome the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Bill, which seeks to reduce costs in the administration of Garda compensation claims by having claims assessed by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, rather than the High Court. Under the revised scheme, an injured member of the force will make an application to the Garda Commissioner, who will then cause a report to be prepared. Where the report concludes that an applicant was injured as a result of a malicious incident, the report will be sent to the PIAB. Under the current Garda compensation scheme, applications are made to the Minister for Justice for an initial assessment. Trainee gardaí who are currently excluded will be eligible for compensation under the new scheme. This is very welcome, because previously they were excluded. Under the current legislation, applications for compensation must be made to the High Court regardless of the amount in damages being sought. This has led to delay and high costs for both the applicant-claimant and the State. It is proposed that the PIAB will assess claims using a quantum. Legal representation is not required but can be used for applications to the PIAB. Where a claimant is not happy with the proposed award, he or she may apply to the courts. This Bill will allow applications to be made in the appropriate court, whether it be High Court, Circuit Court or District Court. It is envisaged that using the PIAB as an assessor of compensation will mean fewer cases progressing to the courts. This will lead to a reduction in legal costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> The total amount of awards that were paid out under the current scheme between 2016 and June 2021 was €26.1 million. The actual legal fees paid out amounted to the staggering figure of almost €10 million - €9.96 million. It is hard to believe that. The legal costs incurred in proceedings regularly exceeded the amount of damages actually awarded. Therefore, we welcome this Bill and it is imperative that it be brought into operation as quickly as possible, because the current legislation is well past its sell-by date and has many defects in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> We welcome the fact that this Bill provides a streamlined and simplified method for members of An Garda Síochána who are entitled to compensation to have their case dealt with in a manner that is free from legal manipulations and costly High Court cases. The court scheme favours the legal profession as much or more than the members of the Garda that it is intended to serve. It is hoped that this Bill will achieve a greater degree of fairness and transparency for members of the Garda. We often hear stories of situations under the current scheme where one garda receives a certain level of compensation from one High Court judge, while another garda with exactly the same personal injuries receives a lesser or greater payout.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> However, one clear omission from this Bill is the fact that while members of the Criminal Asset Bureau will receive coverage, civilian members of An Garda Síochána who operate, for example, under the functions of the criminal assets legislation will not be covered. The complete exclusion of civilian staff of An Garda Síochána from the remit of the Bill is poor and we are calling on the Minister to address this concern. This would be particularly important in a changing environment where many technical functions associated with criminal investigations that are now carried out by members of An Garda Síochána will also be carried by civilian employees or staff members of An Garda Síochána into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_840">I welcome any Bill that will streamline costs for this State and avoid unnecessary High Court action. Instead, these injury claims will be assessed by the Personal Injury Assessment Board and can be now heard in a separate court or a District Court. Claims that have been paid from 2016 to 2021 amounted to €26.4 million. However, the legal bill was €9.96 million. I understand that in some cases the legal fees exceeded the amount in damages actually awarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">I am sure that this could not continue. Unquestionably, any gardaí who have been injured in the line of duty would agree that it is not in their best interests to experience extensive delays in settling their claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> Another important aspect of this Bill is the transparency and standardisation it will bring about for claimants, which is to be welcomed. How many of these injuries were incurred because of the lack of extra personnel and proper equipment, vehicles and stations? This is evident across the country in stations like Croom, Kilmallock and Newcastle West, where we are still waiting on our Garda station. Is there any update on when we will get the Garda station in Newcastle West? The main Garda station in Newcastle West, with over 4,000 people, has been closed and has not been reopened or rebuilt yet. Where is it? When will the Government finally give adequate services to the Garda in County Limerick? When will the Government put people into Garda stations that have to cover a large area in square miles? The Government is doing it by head of population but if a garda is called out to a scene from a Garda station in County Limerick it can take up to 30 minutes to get there, and that is if a Garda vehicle is available. A garda called out to two incidents cannot make two out of himself or herself so we need extra Garda resources in County Limerick because of the amount of square miles that our Garda stations are covering. We need a proper headquarters and I have asked the Minister earlier when we will get this. The Government has money to throw at everything else in this country. It can provide money to developers but it has no money to give to An Garda Síochána, our fire service, our prison officers and all our front-line workers. Again, that is all city-based money that is being provided. What about the protection of the people in rural areas and small towns and villages in County Limerick?</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> I had an incident two weeks ago - thanks be to God the Passport Office intervened - when a person put their local Garda station on their application and the Passport Office rang the Garda station three times and they could not get through to a garda. Why was that? It was because there was only one garda at that station and he or she had been called out to incidents in the area. We are wondering why we have gardaí who could get injured in the line of duty. It is because they do not have adequate personnel, equipment or cars and that is what we want. When is my headquarters coming and when will we get adequate numbers of gardaí in County Limerick in all its towns and villages? The Government has the buildings and every time I turn around I hear the Government say it is awash with money and all I am hearing is Minister after Minister telling me that his or her Department has loads of money. The Minister for Social Protection and for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, came to Limerick recently and all she kept saying was that they have loads of money in her Department. Why does the Government not have loads of money to invest in An Garda Síochána all around the country, not only in Limerick, and to give adequate services to the people, the taxpayers, the elderly and everyone who has done their bit for this country? When will the Government start investing in that? All the new recruits seem to be put into Dublin and highly populated areas and the Government is leaving the people in the rest of the country vulnerable by not investing. It is all about numbers for the Government and that is all it will look at but a lot of square miles need to be looked at in County Limerick.</p>

          <p eId="para_844">I welcome the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Bill 2021. It is only right and proper that we streamline and make more straightforward the issue of gardaí who are genuinely injured in the course of duty receiving adequate compensation. They might be out of work, have loss of earnings or future earnings or have pain and suffering from an injury and it is only right that we streamline the process of dealing with their claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> It would be neglectful if, in the course of this debate, we did not recognise our fallen gardaí, both men and women, who went about their day's work in an ordinary and honest fashion and who, during the course of that day or night, lost their lives. These people gave their lives to the protection of the people or property of the State and gave their lives to the job. It is most important that we recognise that fact tonight and that we do so in a respectful manner. We should remember the families of those bereaved people so well. I mention people who were injured, who had life altering injuries, who might not have been able to go back to work again and who finished up badly injured because of the job. That can happen a person working on a building site, in forestry or anywhere but we have to take into consideration these men and women who take upon themselves a serious and onerous job and from one second to the next they do not know what they will have to face. It can be any type of awful and harrowing situation like traffic accidents or serious and organised crime. They come across all different types of things in their day-to-day duties but we have to recognise that while other people would steer away from harm, members of the Garda have to go into harm's way.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> I want to speak about the Garda in County Kerry and the service it gives. I know the Minister appreciates the work people do everywhere and in recognising the good work the Garda in Kerry is doing I respectfully ask the Minster to ensure she resources it properly. The one way we can ensure gardaí are safe is to provide them with the machinery they need to do their jobs, whether that is their accommodation where their Garda stations are or the facilities, technology, vehicles and people power they have to deal with situations. We must make sure there are enough people on duty with adequate numbers. I readily acknowledge that a lot has been done in that regard in recent years and that the recruitment is ongoing. I appreciate that because we always have to account for retirements and ill gardaí who need to be replaced to keep the workforce up at a proper level. I want to talk about places like south Kerry, including the Iveragh Peninsula, which is a long commuting distance from the town of Killarney. Whether it is superintendents, chief superintendents or sergeants, we have to ensure we have enough of a hierarchy in those locations and that we adequately resource them to ensure that law and order can be maintained and that people can feel safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> We have a drug problem in Ireland that is running rampant and that causes awful problems for the Garda, and not just in our towns but in smaller areas also. In trying to steer young people away from getting involved in drugs or crime, we need to have a good and strong Garda presence.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> I want to remember fondly gardaí who have retired, who were great characters and who did great work in our communities. They were community-based gardaí and they were friends with everybody and at the same time there was a respect for them and the role they carried out.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CarolNolan" eId="spk_305">
          <from>Deputy Carol Nolan<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_849">I welcome the progress this Bill has made, especially as it is primarily concerned with providing a new compensation scheme to repeal and replace the current expensive and slow approach that has not been fit for purpose for some time. It is clear from experience that the legitimate claims of members of An Garda Síochána were not being addressed in a fair and timely manner. We know, for example, that the current Acts make a distinction between the injuries of a minor and a non-minor nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The Bill before us removes this distinction and ensures that all injuries inflicted as a result of a malicious incident are covered by the new scheme. Of course, the vast majority of gardaí go about their business without being subjected to assault or attacks of a very serious nature. However, in 2019, for example, 723 incidents of various types of assault on gardaí were recorded. This rose very slightly to 725 in 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> The job is not an easy one and it often ends up involving the need for a great level of restraint and training. Gardaí are not only enforcers of the peace but increasingly they also act in a limited way as first responders to very serious mental health incidents. Information supplied to me earlier this year following a number of parliamentary questions I submitted revealed that from 2018 to 2022 members of the Garda had to intervene and detain people under the Mental Health Act 2001 almost 15,000 times. That is an astonishing number of interventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> I also specifically asked the Minister for the number of Garda interventions involving persons self-harming or harming others due to mental illness over the course of that period of time. Garda authorities confirmed to me that in 2018 alone, 4,002 incidents were recorded on the PULSE system under the "Mental Act detained under" category and that this rose to 4,816 incidents in 2019. In 2020 this figure has had risen substantially to 5,757 incidents. In the reply to the parliamentary question the Minister further indicated to me that Garda authorities had informed her that training with regard to dealing with persons facing mental health emergencies is also given to armed support units during their basic training. This includes a detailed course on dealing with hostage barricade suicide incidents, the vast majority of which according to the Garda involve people experiencing mental health emergencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> This should make it clear to all that gardaí are often placed in situations that may give rise to attack but not all of which are malicious. Some may be due to having to respond to a serious mental health incident. These numbers indicate that there is an overwhelming gap in preventive mental health supports that have developed over the lifetime of successive governments. Garda members, while empathetic and dedicated, are not mental health professionals. Their primary duty is to enforce the law and protect the communities that they serve. Increasingly, however, they are finding themselves on the sharp end of having to intervene in incidents which have only developed because of a lack of services, in this case a lack of mental health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> They may find themselves being heavily criticised for what are essentially problems not of their making. This entire situation is grossly unfair not only to Garda members but more importantly to the many thousands of vulnerable mentally ill people who risk being criminalised because they do not receive the kind of support they need. In this context, it is only right and proper that any garda who faces assault or injuries with malicious intent should have recourse open to them and indeed to their families if the worst-case scenario arises.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> Section 8(2) of the Bill deals with this and other related matters. That is very welcome but particularly the provision within that subsection which outlines in detail the person or persons who may take an application for compensation under the Bill. In the case of death, for example, the dependants of the member of former member, including a spouse or civil partner, a child or stepchild, a parent or grandparent, or a brother, sister, half-brother or half-sister, may make a claim for compensation once they were wholly or partly dependent on the deceased person and have suffered a loss as a result of death. That is significant as it accepts and protects the reality that the family members of gardaí are disproportionately exposed to the loss of their loved one because of the nature of their work.</p>

          <from>Deputy Cormac Devlin<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_856">I welcome the opportunity to examine the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Bill 2021. I thank the Minister and her officials for bringing the legislation before the House. I will be supporting this Bill which will bring Garda compensation claims within the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, process.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> The Bill is aimed at decreasing the length of time it takes for disposing of a Garda compensation claim from initial application to award by providing for clear time limits for each stage of the process. The new process is also aimed at ensuring that avenues for settlement and resolution are available at the earliest possible stage. Where cases end up before the courts, they can be dealt with at the appropriate level, not necessarily the High Court, which can speed up the process and reduce legal costs. Hopefully the Bill will simplify the system for gardaí who suffer an injury during the course of their duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> I want to use this occasion to pay tribute to gardaí for the work they do not only across the country, but in each individual community, particularly in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire where I recently had the pleasure of joining serving and retired gardaí and their families at events in Shankill and Dún Laoghaire Garda stations to mark the beginning of the centenary year of the first Civic Guards coming to Dún Laoghaire. Of course, the first policing presence in the area was established in 1836 with the founding of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, DMP, force. The first DMP officers in Dún Laoghaire were based at a facility on Cumberland Street, before moving to 100 Upper George’s Street in 1839. The police presence at 100 Upper George’s Street continued for over 150 years, when the Garda moved to its current station on Corrig Avenue in 1992. Over the years, hundreds of gardaí have served with distinction in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> At last week's commemoration, we remembered the 83 fallen gardaí who made the ultimate sacrifice. We also remembered their colleagues who were severely injured in the course of carrying out their duties. Last week I had the great pleasure to meet the senior surviving garda from the old Dún Laoghaire station, Murt Gleeson, along with other former members who provided outstanding service to the community over the years including retired inspector Pat Neill and soon to be retired Detective Superintendent Martin Creighton and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> As we enter a very sensitive period of commemorations, I thank the Garda centenary committee in Dún Laoghaire for their efforts, led by Inspector Adrian Kelly, Garda John Paul Durkan, Garda David L’Estrange, Garda Caroline Sheridan, Garda Gemma Conway, Detective Garda Jim Mulligan and reserve Garda Kieran Browne, along with retired members, Eamon Hession, Angeline Conefry and of course Ed Ryan who did so much work researching the history of the Garda Síochána in Dún Laoghaire and Shankill. There will be other commemorations at Blackrock and other Garda stations, to mark the fantastic work done by gardaí over the past 100 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> As move to the second century of the Garda Síochána in Dún Laoghaire, I ask the Minister to raise the issue of facilities in the area with the Garda Commissioner. This has been discussed previously and considered by Garda headquarters in Phoenix Park. There has been exceptional population growth along the Luas green line, particularly from Carrickmines to Sandyford. It is estimated that almost 30,000 new residents will soon be living in this area. A new Garda station at Cherrywood is badly needed and I know it is open for consideration. So too is the need for a more modern station. The station in Dún Laoghaire was built in the 1990s. Given the increasing demographic in the area, it also needs modernisation. I hope the Minister will take that back to discuss with the Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> I thank the Minister for staying for the full debate and listening to the views and considerations of Members. I hope all Members across the House will support this important legislation. It is not only important for the Garda but also important for the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_864">I thank Deputy Connolly and her group for giving us this time to speak on such an important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> Changes to the Garda compensation scheme have been proposed for a number of years and therefore this Bill is long overdue and welcome. For instance, the current scheme has a requirement to go to the High Court, which is leading to many instances where the legal costs incurred in the proceedings regularly exceed the amount awarded in damages. Therefore, we welcome this Bill and it is imperative that it be brought into operation as quickly as possible as the current legislation is well past its sell-by date and has many defects.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> We welcome that the Bill provides for a streamlined and simplified method for members of An Garda Síochána, who are entitled to compensation, to have their case dealt with in a manner that is free from legal manipulations and costly High Court cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">This current scheme favours the legal profession as much as, or more than, the members of An Garda Síochána it is intended to serve. It is hoped that this Bill will achieve a greater degree of fairness and transparency for members of the Garda. We often hear stories of situations under the current scheme whereby one garda receives a certain level of compensation from one High Court judge while another garda, with exactly the same personal injuries, receives a lesser or greater payout. It is, therefore, hoped that this Bill will lead to a greater degree of standardisation of approach through the PIAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> However, one clear omission from this Bill is that while members of the Criminal Assets Bureau will receive coverage, civilian members of the Garda who operate, for example, under the functions of criminal assets legislation, will not be covered. The complete exclusion of the civilian staff of the Garda from the remit of the Bill is puzzling and we are calling on the Minister to address this concern. This is particularly important in a changing environment where many technical functions associated with criminal investigations that are now carried out by members of the Garda will in the future also be carried out by civilian employees or staff members of An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> I have been involved through the years with the Garda in my own community of Schull and Goleen. While we are talking about the Garda, I would like to acknowledge some of the great work it does in west Cork. Last weekend, I attended the west Cork Garda youth awards in Kinsale. It would do your heart good to see so many young people working so hard in their lives and being rewarded for doing so. We often hear about the things young people do wrong and it is seldom they get acknowledgement. In fairness to the Garda, it put together a great display and gave these young people an opportunity to be rewarded. People from Castletownbere, Bandon, Clonakilty, Macroom, Skibbereen and other places received awards for their achievements in their local communities. I thank the Garda. A lot of work goes on behind the scenes. I thank Garda Damian White, Garda Don Davis and Sergeant Ian O'Callaghan who worked hard to bring out the best of the youth in our communities. That is the work of the Garda at its very best. I also thank Garda Brigid Hartnett and Superintendent Brendan Fogarty. I wish Chief Superintendent Con Cadogan a happy upcoming retirement. His retirement was announced at that function last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> The role of the Garda in the community is important. I have often said it is important for gardaí to be seen in the community and to work in the community. I see that in local gardaí such as Garda John McCarthy in Kilbrittain, who is out there and working in the community. Such gardaí are always with people and calling to their neighbours and elderly people to make them feel secure at home. The same is true of Garda Jonathan McCarthy in Ballydehob.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> We have a situation that must be looked into. The superintendent situation in Bantry is serious. That position has not been filled for a number of months. The superintendent in Bantry is of considerable importance to the people in that Garda district, which stretches to Castletownbere, Schull, Drimoleague and places like that. This situation cannot continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> I know Deputy Mattie McGrath has more to say on this issue than me but I raise the matter of closed Garda stations. The Government took the decision a few years to close Garda stations and I imagine the Minister does not want to hear any more about it. However, I come from a community in Goleen where the Garda station has closed. The same applies in Adrigole and Ballinacarrig. Those Garda stations are still closed. Why are they not being used to house Ukrainian people? The community is willing to work. We do not need to be drawing up super plans that cost a load of money. We are willing. I call on the Government to give us the Garda station. There are 17 rooms in the Goleen Garda station. It would rejuvenate the local community. The intention is to sell the Garda station for profit instead of giving it back to the community.</p>

          <p eId="para_873">Gabhaim buíochas le Teachtaí Connolly agus Pringle for giving us their time slot. I certainly welcome this legislation and I hope its passage is not impeded in any way, shape or form. It is a ridiculous situation that gardaí are going into the line of duty and as much, if not more, is paid to legal firms as is paid in compensation to those who deserve it. I condemn out of hand the incident some time ago in the Border area where a garda was lured down a bóithrín on his own and got an awful experience from thugs, which is all they can be called.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> I saw a news report of a case where intruders or robbers broke into a house in Wexford. They found out in the course of the robbery that a garda owned the house and went out of their way to damage and destroy the house. There is no place for that kind of thuggery or for attacking or undermining the Garda. The vast majority of gardaí I have ever dealt with have been impeccable. They work to serve their communities and the people without fear or favour.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> I pay tribute to Sergeant Ray Moloney who has been a considerable addition to the Cahir-Cashel district in recent years. He has now been transferred. We had a lovely function last Sunday, organised by the community, in the Cahir House Hotel, Cathair Dún Iascaigh. It was a nice tribute to Sergeant Moloney for the work he did in community policing. He was assisted by Garda Jenny Gough, Garda Noel Glavin and many others, including Garda Judy Davern and others. We need that sergeant replaced. We are getting two replacements but we need one in the community. No police force in the world can police without the support of the public. That support must be nurtured, minded and taught through, for example, visits to schools. The late Sergeant Niall O'Halloran was an awful loss to our community. He used to visit the schools and bring pupils in fifth and sixth class to Templemore to encourage them to choose a career in the Garda. He was taken from his wife, son and family at a very young age through illness. As I said, he is an enormous loss. I wish Sergeant Moloney well. We want strength in our numbers of community gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> We also need a new Garda station in Clonmel. I believe the Minister is coming to Clonmel amárach. She is coming to Tipperary anyway. Several Ministers and taoisigh have seen that Clonmel Garda station is Dickensian. It is in a desperate condition. The matter has been raised for nigh on 50 years, if not more. It was raised as an issue long before I ever thought about politics. The Minister will see for herself if she visits it that the Garda station is not suitable as a functioning Garda station. The building is owned by the county council but it is leased and it is not practical. We have been packaged and bundled with different towns around the country. Some of them have fallen out of the package but we are still in a bundle of three. Now, for some strange, bizarre and unknown reason, we have been linked in with a court building project. I do not have much experience of it but I know that the people who build Garda stations under the contracts involved have a specific skill set. Court buildings are different and putting two or three Garda stations into a bundle with courts buildings is nonsense. It is a delaying tactic or a stalking horse, as far as I am concerned. Those buildings have wholly different functionality. Their ambience and appearance are different. Everything is different. I would love to see the three Garda stations being allowed to progress. We have the site, which we did not have for years. We have planning permission. The site is that of the old Army barracks. We need the go-ahead. We cannot be tying it up any more with delays.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> Gardaí get injured in the line of duty. They face all kinds of situations. When they get a 999 call or any kind of distress call, they do not know what they are going to find when they arrive on the scene. We need numbers. We need them in Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir. There were never fewer numbers in the Cahir district. We need gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> We are also in danger because of the new plan to appoint fewer superintendents and one chief for two counties. We have an excellent chief superintendent in Derek Smart in Cashel. He is doing a great job. The next chief will probably have to cover Clare and Thiobraid Árann. One would have to go through Limerick to get to Clare. It is bizarre. It could take you two hours to travel from one part of the region to the other. That is not tenable. I ask the Minister to review that situation because it is penny-pinching that does not serve the people. The Garda is there to serve the people and gardaí do serve the people. They want to serve the people but they must be supported to do so. Ní neart go cur le chéile is what I say. No police force can perform its duties without the support of the public. Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí. Mol na daoine and tiocfaidh siad freisin.</p>

          <p eId="para_879">We must recognise the regrettable fact that virtually every member of the Garda has been subjected to assault or acts of violence in the course of his or her career. It is, unfortunately, a very common occurrence. I know from speaking to members of the Garda that frequently when they are out, particularly in the evening time and at weekends, they are subjected to assaults and violent attacks. It is also important for us in this House to accept and acknowledge that not every act of assault or act of violence perpetrated against a member of the Garda results in that garda initiating a compensation claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The vast majority of assaults or violent attacks on members of An Garda Síochána are simply accepted by gardaí and they do nothing about it. They do not go down the route of seeking to secure compensation. We need to acknowledge that being a member of An Garda Síochána is a very dangerous job, particularly now. Members are dealing with people who have taken drink or drugs and who are in a violent condition. Often members of the Garda are forced into the centre of difficult situations, trying to resolve an issue involving violent people. </p>
          <p eId="para_881"> Like other Members of this House, I welcome the legislation that is being proposed. Obviously members of An Garda Síochána who sustain an injury which is maliciously inflicted on them during the course of their work, or even when they are off duty but it is inflicted because of their work, are entitled to compensation. That is the system that has operated to date but it is correct that we try to update the Garda compensation scheme. At present, the situation requires a garda to initiate a claim that is ultimately heard in the High Court, although on many occasions those cases are determined or resolved in advance of determination by the High Court. Under this legislation, it is proposed that the offices of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, will be used for the purposes of assessing and determining the amount of damages to which a garda is entitled as a result of sustaining injuries. Obviously, like any applicant to PIAB, if the garda is not satisfied with the amount being proposed, he or she is perfectly entitled to take the claim forward to the appropriate court. I note under this legislation that the different courts are available to anyone bringing a claim. Members of the Garda can go to the High Court or the Circuit Court. I suspect that very few claims will be initiated in the District Court. </p>
          <p eId="para_882"> In recent years a policy objective has been pursued by this House and by the Executive to try to ensure that the amount of awards made to persons making personal injury claims are reduced. The primary reason for this is we want to see the premiums charged by insurance companies come down. There is obviously no similar corresponding policy objective when it comes to Garda compensation but there is a requirement to ensure that we get greater consistency when it comes to awards that are handed out to members of An Garda Síochána for sustaining injuries during the course of their employment. We also have to understand, however, that some very serious injuries are sustained by gardaí as a result of their work. I would be concerned if there is a policy objective to reduce the amount of compensation that members of An Garda Síochána are entitled to as a result of injuries maliciously inflicted on them during the course of their work or as a result of their work. In fact, when one looks at the awards that have been made for members of An Garda Síochána who have made the most supreme sacrifice, those whose lives have been lost in the course of duty, the awards that have been handed out have not been large enough. Obviously when members of An Garda Síochána are killed during the course of duty or as a result of their job, their families, including their dependants, are entitled to take a claim and money is paid to the families. In the case of one of the unfortunate members of the Garda who was murdered recently, the resultant claim the family received was in the region of €1.3 million but in my opinion, that is not enough for the loss of a father, husband or indeed, a wife and a mother who was a member of An Garda Síochána. Obviously, a huge amount of the calculation depends on a loss of earnings claim but also a dependency claim. We must recognise that if a garda goes out and gives his or her life during the course of duty, that requires a payment that is significantly in excess of what is ordinarily calculated as being an appropriate amount for a fatal injuries claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> We also need to remember the gardaí who have lost their lives in the course of duty. It is an extraordinary sacrifice, not just for them to make but for their families to make. I think of members of An Garda Síochána who were killed recently, including Adrian Donohoe, Tony Golden and Colm Horkan. They gave their lives defending the community and of course, many other members of An Garda Síochána in the 1970s and 1980s gave their lives fighting to protect this country from the unnecessary violence being perpetrated in the North of the island</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> I am very happy to support this important legislation. I presume the Minister has consulted with the Garda representative organisations in respect of the Bill. It should be enacted promptly and hopefully we will find ourselves in a situation where members of the Garda do not have to go to court to secure the compensation to which they are entitled but instead will be given a fair and reasonable offer by the PIAB, taking into account the injuries they have sustained and, more importantly, taking into account the absolutely essential role they play in defending the people of Ireland every day of the week. </p>

          <p eId="para_889">We welcome that we are here tonight to introduce a right to statutory sick leave, which is positive. It is a shame that it took a global pandemic to get Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil there, but here we are. This amendment aims to make sick leave a real and substantial reality for workers from the word go, as opposed to the Government's proposal. The Government's proposal is to start with three days and then, subject to the whims of the Minister, we may go up to ten days. I support the amendments that propose to start from ten days. That would be a significant improvement. Our amendment goes even further by saying that the reason we are here is the broad acceptance for the need for sick pay. This is about workers' rights and about society at large. It is not good for anybody to have workers who are sick going into work or feeling compelled to go into work. That is bad for everybody involved and for society at large. Workers should, therefore, be entitled to a number of sick days they are sick. It should be the bottom line in legislation that is actually focused on workers' rights as opposed to a very meagre nod to the right of workers to sick days that is extremely circumscribed by the current proposal. These are the essential elements of the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_890">I will speak to my amendments. We debated this over and back with the Minister of State, Deputy English, on Committee Stage. He said that he would go back and reflect on some of the measures. This element of the Bill is a non-starter for us. We introduced our own sick pay legislation through Private Member's business two years ago. As Deputy Murphy quite rightly said, the pandemic now appears to be mostly over, yet we are still in a situation where we have not legislated for it. As we constantly said in the committee room, in every other EU country that has statutory sick pay, most have free GP care. It is imbalanced to talk purely about sick pay when other elements within society do not stand up in the context of the worker. It was also instructive to me, and I believe to other members of the committee, how much the weight of conversation in the committee room was about the employer, the employer, the employer. That is understandable but we really want to talk about the worker who is sick and who, therefore, feels that he or she has to go to work even when sick. Let us imagine being in that position where you really feel it is going to hurt you so badly in their pocket that you must pretend to be well to go to work. On that basis, we strongly feel that the Minister's intention to go from three to ten days over an ill-defined period is not strong enough. We want to start at ten days with the ambition to go to 30 days, which would be in keeping with a modern, decent republic. This is why we feel so strongly about it. I withdrew my amendments on Committee Stage, as did other colleagues, in order to resubmit them on Report Stage. I intend to press amendment No. 3 to a vote.</p>

          <p eId="para_893">I thank Deputies for their contributions. I have been very clear on the medium-term plan, which is to make sure that employers know what their obligations will be and that employees know what their rights are. The statutory entitlement to sick pay will be phased in as part of a four-year plan. The initial entitlement would be to three paid sick leave days per year once the Bill is enacted and commenced. This will, effectively, fill the gap in coverage caused by the illness benefit waiting days. Closing the gap of current waiting days before being able to access illness benefit will help to reduce the number of sick employees presenting for work. It is important to point out that illness benefit kicks in on day four and runs up to one year and, in some cases, for two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">It is not the case that people will have no income. That said, illness benefit in Ireland is very low and that is something we need to examine in the context of the budget and the social welfare Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> The four-year plan takes account of the current economic climate and existing financial pressures on businesses. The number of days will increase incrementally, with the goal being that the employer will eventually cover the cost of ten sick days per year from the fourth year of operation, after which illness benefit continues to kick in.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> We fully understand that many businesses, particularly SMEs and especially those along the Border, are struggling at the moment with additional costs, often linked to the Russian invasion of Ukraine or the aftermath of Covid-19 and Brexit. This includes higher energy costs, higher input costs, wage increases and costs imposed by the Government such as auto-enrolment and the additional public holiday. It is in recognition of this that we have chosen to phase this in gradually.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> Amendment No. 17 would provide that the number of paid sick leave days cannot be reduced by below ten by any ministerial order. As statutory sick leave will be introduced at three days per year, this amendment would not align with the timeline of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> Amendment No. 18 would provide that there is no restriction on how many days statutory sick leave could increase by in any given year. Section 5 currently stipulates that the Minister may not increase the number of sick days by more than three in any 12-month period. This provides certainty to employers by ensuring that unexpectedly large increases in the number of sick leave days they have paid for will not be introduced. This is a sensible approach that will allow small businesses to plan ahead and anticipate these additional costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> Providing the Minister with the ability to increase the number of sick leave days by as many as ten in one year, as amendment No. 19 would allow, would be disproportionate. Such a dramatic increase in coverage in one year could have unintended negative consequences. It could force employers to lay off staff, make people redundant, reduce their hours or even reduce their pay. That would not be a desirable outcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_900">The Tánaiste's arguments in favour of sick pay and why it is good are all arguments for allowing workers to have sick pay for the days they are sick. That is the bottom line. They are also arguments in favour of amendment No. 18 which proposes to decrease the limits on the actual number of days. If we were lucky enough to have a left Government - hopefully one with an eco-socialist programme - it could then decide not to take the snail-pace approach of the Government of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael but instead rapidly decide to move to at least ten days at the very limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> We compare Ireland with some of our European colleagues. In Austria, workers are entitled to between ten and 16 weeks - not days - of paid sick leave on 100% pay. In the Netherlands, workers are entitled to up to 70% of their wages for up to two years. We are well behind Europe as a whole and even more behind the leaders in Europe in terms of basic issues in the sense that it is a workers' rights issue but also a public health issue. Again, while is welcome that we will have sick pay, it is a real shame that the Government is rejecting these amendments and taking such a minimalist, snail-pace approach to the introduction of sick leave.</p>

          <p eId="para_902">I will repeat what we said on Committee Stage. Whenever an improvement to the lot of the worker is proposed, the Government always seems to speak of Armageddon and about how difficult it will be for employers and how businesses will fold, etc. Whenever we propose issues such as a basic rate of pay, a living wage or anything in this area we are always told it will place an unreasonable burden on employers, whereas in every other modern European country it is a basic provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> I restate to the Tánaiste that there are basic provisions even on this island. People in the North of the country have free GP care, something that we have not managed to organise for ourselves in the Republic. That is why this is lopsided. We cannot always think solely, as appears to be the contention of the Tánaiste's party and Government, about the burden on the employer. He cited the war in Ukraine and Border issues with Brexit. The sick worker who has to go to work on the basis of having a low-paid job must be at the forefront of everybody's mind. We are living in a country in which 23% of workers are on low pay. That is what has been driving our attempts to rectify the matter. As has been said, it is to the credit of the Government that it is attempting to rectify this issue but this does not go far enough to protect workers who should not feel they should have to go to work when they are unwell in order to feed their children. That is, unfortunately, the scenario.</p>

          <p eId="para_904">Like many others, the Tánaiste included, I welcome the introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme. As I stated in committee, however, there is an issue of discernment here in terms of the scale and size of the employers. What some of the amendments are speaking to, in seeking ten days of immediate sick leave, is wholly inappropriate for microenterprises. That needs to be said first and foremost.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> The second issue for small businesses is that they have a small number of staff. In the case of an employer who loses one staff member to sickness for a day - let us say it is a delivery company that needs a delivery driver - how is the business supposed to carry on operating that day without bringing in an additional person to substitute? The employer needs a substitute and will have to pay for him or her. If the business gets that substitute at short notice, the employer will pay pretty handsomely for the day's service to cover that sickness. There is no support in this scheme for microenterprises in that scenario. We all understand that if one person is out on the statutory sick pay scheme in a company that employs a couple of hundred people, the company can cover that person. As we know, most companies already have that in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> When the Minister of State, Deputy English, appeared before the committee, he gave an undertaking of sorts that this matter would be looked at and an amendment to that effect would, potentially, be tabled. That is what I am asking for. I think we all agree that a sick pay scheme is right. We all agree that we want to bring ourselves up to European norms, although I point out the headwinds facing businesses in this country are not the same as they are in Europe. They are similar but not the same. The headwinds for small businesses and microenterprises in this country make it very difficult for them to create margins and remain viable and profitable. People might say the Bill provides that sick pay will be only 70% of pay and will be capped at €110, etc. However, if a small business such as a newsagent is paying sick pay and for the substitution of a worker, that is not small money. If that is to be done for a number of employees, as we move from three to five and then to seven and ten days, that will become a pretty onerous cost. I ask the Tánaiste to provide for a review of the scheme after the first six or 12 months to see how it is impacting on small- and medium-sized enterprises. A number of the amendments, particularly those providing for ten days of sick pay immediately, are totally unacceptable to small employers. By the way, people might say private employers are making out like bandits; they certainly are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> Second, it is becoming even more difficult to start a viable business in this country. I was with the Waterford local enterprise office, LEO, the other day and we were looking at new applications to the office. It is very difficult. Many businesses, unfortunately, will probably not be viable over the long term. People have great ideas but when they try to put them into practice and make a commercial business out of them, it is extremely difficult. People need to remember that the SME community employs close to 1 million people here. If we do not look after these businesses, there will be no employment and we will not have to worry about sick days because there will be no employers to pay for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> I welcome the Bill but some of the amendments are wholly inappropriate. I ask the Tánaiste to take cognisance of the SME community, microenterprises in particular, and put a review process in place to see how the scheme is operating after six months.</p>

          <p eId="para_909">I think we are in danger of losing our way on this a little. Sick pay is a very important instrument of public health. For employers who may struggle to pay even the modest amount of sick leave provided for in the Bill, which will increase further as time goes on, there is a benefit to them that I do not believe we are considering. When a sick person comes into the workplace and makes other people in the workplace sick, it creates a bigger problem. We should come at this from the perspective that it a necessary public health intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> I join previous speakers in saying fair play to the Tánaiste for bringing this legislation forward. We may have an issue with some of its elements but the facts that it is before the House and we are having this debate are very much to the Tánaiste's credit. I am not saying the money is not important - of course it is - but the cost of not doing this could be multiples of the money that will be spent on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_911">The argument I am making, which I often make, is one in favour of incremental progress. I appreciate that for many people progress is too slow, but I have a responsibility as Minister to listen to all sides of the argument and to look at it from the point of view of employers as well as that of employees. In my view, the most important workers' right is the right to work, and I want to raise the bar continually to improve pay, terms and conditions and workers' rights, but not to the extent that businesses will become unviable. Business owners, in particular small employers, not least around the Border area and in small towns, tell me a lot is coming at them at the moment, such as higher labour costs, input costs, energy costs and insurance costs, which I am working on, as well as higher costs the Government is putting on them. Those costs include ones arising from the additional public holiday, for which I signed the order and which I stand over, and from auto-enrolment, which I kick-started as Minister for Social Protection and stand over also. These are all additional costs for employers and I do not want to end up, with every good intention, putting workers in a bad position whereby their employer will be forced to lay them off, reduce their hours or even reduce their pay, because that would be counterproductive.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> Comparisons that are being made with other European countries are a little misleading because they do not take into account illness benefit. Many countries have an integrated system of sick pay and illness benefit. What will happen with the Bill, when this new right comes into place, is that for the first three days, sick pay will be provided by the employer, after which illness benefit will kick in for up to two years. It is not the case it is only three, five or ten days, given illness benefit will kick in.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> Moreover, it needs to borne in mind that where there is better provision for sick pay, as is the case in many European countries, it is based on a very different social insurance system, whereby the average social insurance contribution for employers is 20% rather than 10%, and whereby low-paid workers pay a lot more in income tax and social insurance. In several of the Nordic countries, low-paid and minimum wage workers pay five, ten or 13 times as much income tax as they do here, and I do not think it is a very honest argument to say low-paid and minimum wage workers should have the same social insurance benefits as people in Nordic countries but should not have to pay the kinds of high taxes they would pay in a Nordic country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1061">I thank Deputy Ó Ríordáin and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. The issue here is that a very gross discrimination was created by the Government's proposal, whereby an employee whose service was interrupted would go back to zero, lose his or her rights to sick pay and have to work up the 13 weeks again. This meant that the Bill, as drafted, excluded many of the most vulnerable workers the Government claims to be trying to protect. Those who are under the most pressure to go to work even if they are sick were left in a situation where they would be excluded from this protection. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, pointed out the impact this would have on women and migrant workers in particular. Its general secretary, Patricia King, wrote to the Tánaiste pointing out that the existing provision would "leave hundreds of thousands of mostly women and foreign-born essential workers employed in low-pay jobs, who routinely have their service broken by their employer, without coverage for 3 months each year". A good case study in this regard is the position of childcare workers, 98% of whom are female, being let go over the summer holidays and rehired in September, who would, therefore, be without the entitlement to sick pay for the first 13 weeks after their return.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062"> The Government's amendment No. 7 goes some way to addressing this issue, but it does not go all the way. My reading of the amendment is that it will deal with the previous period of employment, that is, the period of employment before the current one in which the need for sick pay arises. However, my understanding - the Tánaiste will correct me if I am wrong - is that it would not include any period before that. If, say, an employee has done ten weeks previously and comes back within the 26-week period and does another three weeks, then, if amendment No. 7 is passed, he or she would be entitled to sick pay. That is a step forward. However, it is my understanding that where an employee has worked for three weeks in the current period and five weeks in the period before that, for example, and there was a previous break at that point, before which the employee had worked another five weeks, then this total of 13 weeks would not be taken into account. The Government amendment would deal with the situation of the hypothetical childcare worker because that involves a big block of work, followed by a break, followed by another big block of work. However, there are other workers who have their service broken continually and who might be accumulating the 13 weeks of service in smaller blocks. As far as I can tell, amendment No. 7 would not deal with that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063"> Setting aside the position of contract workers, people's service being broken and so on, there is a basic public health need for sick pay and the right to it should apply from day one, regardless. That is a basic point that the Government's amendment certainly does not address. I am interested in the Tánaiste's response to that point and to my question as to whether past periods of service prior to the immediately previous period would be included as counting towards service for sick pay purposes.</p>

        <speech by="#LouiseOReilly" eId="spk_329">
          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1064">My amendment No. 5 is similar to amendment No. 4. I appreciate that the Government's amendment No. 7 is an effort to address our concerns on this issue, which the Tánaiste indicated previously that he would consider. What he has proposed is an advance and it certainly is welcome. It captures the situation of childcare workers, who adhere to a fixed pattern of work that includes a break of a couple of months every year. Despite what people might like to think about me, I am not suggesting that this is an issue with all employers. I understand the need for employers. However, some of them use the tactic of taking people on, letting them go, taking them on again and so forth. They do it to keep workers on their toes and ensure they feel vulnerable etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> If we are to deal with those rogue employers, if we want to call them that, I am not sure whether amendment No. 7 does enough. I am sure the intention is that they would be captured but I am not just not sure the amendment achieves that. As an Teachta Paul Murphy said, I would welcome clarification from the Tánaiste in terms of how service can be accumulated over a number of years where there is more than one break in service. Given the nature of seasonal work and the situation of vulnerable workers, who might be working on contract rather than being directly employed and may be laid off for a week and then taken back, the service requirement is difficult. I am not hostile to there being some service requirement but what we learned during the pandemic is that the people who are the most vulnerable are those who are the lowest paid. If we do not get this right, they are the ones who are least likely to benefit from this protection. I fully appreciate this is not the Tánaiste's intention, but it is important to allow people to accumulate the service and to make it very clear how they can do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066"> I understand there was consultation recently by the Department of Social Protection on developing an app that would give information on how people can accumulate entitlements. I wonder whether something similar might be developed to deal with the accumulation of the entitlement to sick leave over a number of years. Is that what is intended by amendment No. 7? ICTU was very clear that the people who will be most impacted by the requirement for continuous service are foreign-born workers, women and vulnerable workers who may have difficulty accessing their rights and entitlements at work. These are the workers who probably are least likely to be trade union members but who would be most likely to benefit from such membership. I ask the Tánaiste to take us through amendment No. 7, how it will work and whether it will address our concerns.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_330" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1067">On Committee Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy English, signalled our intention to move an amendment on Report Stage to address the issues raised by the Deputies. The purpose of the amendment is to eliminate uncertainty as to the entitlement of certain workers to sick leave. Section 5 is linked to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973. This means that an employee will not have to qualify again for sick leave merely because they are regularly laid off, for instance, over the summer period. We are well aware that this would be a significant issue in some sectors, particularly for workers in crèche and childcare settings, many of whom work on a term-time pattern. Where an employee is laid off, that does not constitute a break in service. His or her service is continuous for the purpose of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068"> This issue was discussed extensively on both Second and Committee Stages and also with the unions and employers. Deputies rightly identified the risk that certain workers would have to requalify for statutory sick leave on a regular basis if they work on term-time-type contracts and there is a break between contracts as distinct from a routine lay-off. Amendment No. 4 would delete subsections (5) and (6) and would appear to confer an entitlement to sick leave from the beginning of an employment. We think it is reasonable that an employee should have worked for an employer for some time in order to qualify for paid sick leave and to have established an employee-employer relationship. For example, if an employer takes somebody on to work in a shop or restaurant for a few weeks in the summer, it would not be fair if that employee took ten days' sick leave at the start and only worked for a week or two after that. In the case of parental leave, a parent must have completed one year's service with the employer before he or she may take parental leave. It is important to allow sufficient time to establish an employee-employer relationship, which is why we cannot support amendment No. 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> I am advised that it is not the case, under the Bill, that there would be a reset for every service interruption. I am informed that Deputy Paul Murphy's point is mistaken and that every period of service will be added together. This is already covered in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 and amendment No. 7 will cover multiple periods of employment or multiple breaks in employment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1070">I will zone in on that. The wording in amendment No. 7 states: "...where an employee ceases to be the employee of an employer and, not more than 26 weeks after the date of cesser, the employee again becomes the employee of the employer, the period of service of that employee with that employer before the date of cesser shall be deemed to be continuous with the period of service of that employee with that employer after again becoming such employee". The Minister is stating definitively that this does not just cover the period of service immediately prior to the current term, but any previous service would be counted towards the 13 weeks. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_1075">I welcome that and the clarification. The Minister is going to double-check it and that is fair enough. With regard to the service requirement for parental leave, parental leave is something that is planned. One does not wake up and suddenly find oneself with a child and eligibility for parental leave, or at least I hope not. Sick leave is different because it happens suddenly. The two are not the same. As I said, I am not hostile to a service requirement being part of it. It just needs to work for the people for whom we want it to work and who probably need it most, including those least likely to be working in secure employment and so forth. I understand there are service requirements for other forms of leave, but this is different. Workers know when they are coming up to an entitlement for parental leave, while they might not necessarily know when they are going to be sick. The point is that the two things are not the same.</p>

          <p eId="para_1076">I am sympathetic to the point the Deputies are making. Deputy Bruton from my party spoke in favour of this change earlier as well. In particular, when we are saying that it has to be certified, there is an argument for saying that the right should kick in at an earlier stage. At the same time, I am sensitive to the fact that there are employers who take people on seasonally, perhaps for just a short period of three to five or six weeks over the summer. If they found that they spent half of that time paying somebody to be out sick and paying the person's replacement, that would put an undue burden on them particularly for those types of summer jobs and very short-term jobs. That is why we have gone with the view that the person should accrue at least some service. I am not minded to accept the amendments, but I understand the Deputies' motivation. It might be something we change in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1095">I will be reasonably brief on this series of amendments as we are eager to get to amendment No. 30. This is a series of amendments deleting various considerations on which the Minister is meant to base his decision as to whether he increases the number of days of sick leave. The considerations I am seeking to delete are the state of the economy, competitiveness, the state of economic sectors and employers and the views of employers, and I can tell the Minister in advance that they will not be in favour of increasing the number of sick pay days so he can take that into account right now. I am seeking to add the effects of inflation on the cost of living for employees, which is currently wildly out of control.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096"> The point is that, for us, this is something that should be driven by workers' rights and public health consideration, not by the view of IBEC that it cannot possibly sustain paying workers sick pay or the view of "competitiveness", which is to a large degree a byword for keeping unit labour costs down, not having too many costs on employers and so forth. The same points apply in terms of the state of economic sectors and employers. We believe this should be an automatic process and we have tabled other amendments that seek to provide for that. However, to the extent that it is not an automatic process, the Government should consider things affecting the interests of ordinary people as opposed to those of business when it comes to making the consideration about increasing the number of sick pay days.</p>

          <p eId="para_1097">I have tabled a similar amendment regarding what should be considered. Of course, it is open to the Minister to consider a rake of things that may not be in the legislation, but we want to include "the state of society generally, the public interest and employee well-being” in what should be considered. On the inclusion of "employee" well-being, it is not a word I like. I prefer the word "worker" as I believe it is more descriptive. However, the inclusion of that is intended to balance this in favour of workers, so that when all things are being considered the Minister is not just looking at the state of business, enterprise and employers but is also looking at employee well-being, the state of society generally and the public interest. That would broaden it to make it fair for all parties. When we talk about balance, it cannot always be balance in favour of the employer. Sometimes it just has to be in favour of the worker.</p>

          <p eId="para_1098">Amendments Nos. 11, 13 and 14 would disrupt the balance in the Bill that protects the rights and obligations of both employers and employees. This is a progressive Bill and will ensure that all employees will have financial protection from day one of a medically certified absence. However, the Government does not want to jeopardise jobs by placing an unsustainable cost and administrative burden on business. The introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme must be balanced with the need to ensure the viability of the business and enterprise sector, thereby protecting jobs. It is entirely logical that the Minister would have regard to the state of the economy, the business environment and national competitiveness before adjusting the number of paid sick leave days provided for under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099"> In recent times we have witnessed a series of unprecedented and unforeseen events that have had significant impacts on the global and Irish economies, including Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These events are by their nature unplanned, and their impacts may be more widely felt by specific sectors of the economy. It is reasonable, therefore, that the Minister of the day would take account of any economic shocks when adjusting the number of paid sick leave days employers are required to cover. There is no sense in adjusting the number of sick leave days to a level that is unsustainable for businesses and leads to a loss of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100"> Regarding amendment No. 12, it could be argued that these areas are already covered under section 6(1), which provides that the Minister may consider,<i> inter alia</i>, the state of the economy, the impact on employers and employees, the views of trade unions and any other matters the Minister deems relevant. This provides flexibility and allows the Minister to consider all relevant issues in addition to those specified in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">Although, having said that, I am minded to accept amendment No. 12, which would include an additional point to be considered by the Minister, which is the state of society generally, the public interest and employee well-being. We might have a slight numbering issue because that would give us two paragraph (b)s, so hopefully that would not create a major issue in having to come back here, but I do think I can accept amendment No. 12 because it is a reasonable matter to consider and adds to the list of matters he would consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102"> In terms of amendment No. 15, the effect of inflation on the cost of living for employees is more relevant to pay levels than sick pay levels, so I would not be able to accept that.</p>

If we are going to say to workers we are introducing it at three days, which we think is very minimal, and it will go up to ten and then, it is hoped, up from there, the idea that included in the legislation is the possibility of future Ministers actually reducing the number of sick leave days undermines the expectation. There is not a built-in mechanism here for the number of days to increase, which we think there should be, but at the very least, not including a provision for future Ministers to reduce the number of sick pay days is a very reasonable amendment. We should not be going backwards and we should not legislate for future Ministers to go backwards. The Tánaiste will be able to respond with all sorts of nightmare scenarios whereby we have no choice but to go backwards. That is okay, but in that situation a future Government can bring legislation to the Dáil and let us have a public debate about reducing the number of sick pay days, as opposed to empowering the Minister simply to be able to do that. We think it should be a one-way upwards ratcheting mechanism in terms of sick days.</p>

I think it was Deputy Howlin at the time who said it would improve productivity, but it did not. I am concerned, given there is form on this, that it could happen. I do not believe that is the intention and I take the Tánaiste's bona fides that this is a very positive step. We have all welcomed it, but there would be no harm to put that little floor in so that when progress is made, at the very least there would have to be a change in the law and that would require a debate in here.

          <p eId="para_1118">Section 6 provides that the first ministerial order made under the Bill will not reduce the number of statutory sick leave days. Subsection (2)(a)(i) provides that no ministerial order will reduce the number of statutory sick leave days below three. This means that once the Bill is enacted and commenced, the number of statutory sick leave days can never go below three. The effect of the amendment would be that the number of sick leave days provided could never be reduced. I have set out the four-year plan and there are currently no plans to reduce the number of sick leave days provided for under the Bill. I have been very clear about our intention to move to ten days over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119"> I acknowledge the arguments the Deputies make. If the Minister were to reduce the number of days by order, that order could be rescinded by the Dáil, but I take the point they make. It certainly would not be the intention of this Minister - nor do I think of any future Minister - to go backwards in terms of the number of sick leave days, and if they were to do so, perhaps they should do so by primary legislation rather than by order. On that basis, I can accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1129">Section 6 provides that the Minister will not make an order adjusting the number of statutory sick leave days under the Bill until 12 months after its enactment, and that a period of 12 months must pass between each subsequent adjustment. This amendment would remove that provision and place no restrictions on how often the number of sick leave days could be changed. Limiting adjustments to once every 12 months provides both employers and employees with a degree of certainty around their obligations, entitlements and costs. Once enacted, employers will know in advance of each year what their obligations are in relation to statutory sick leave. This will allow for better alignment with contracts of employment and tax responsibilities. The limit on adjustments will also allow the Minister time to reflect on the impact of any change The fact that the adjustment, which can now only be an upwards adjustment, can only happen every 12 months is a reasonable one, allowing employers to plan ahead and to know what their costs and payroll obligations will be. If a future Minister wanted to go faster, that would best be done primary legislation. I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1134">I move amendment No. 21:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1135">In page 7, line 4, after “day” to insert “equivalent to one hundred per cent of an employee’s pay”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">This group of amendments deals with the rate of sick pay. All our amendments are effectively trying to get sick pay of 100%. The level of sick pay proposed by the Government is low, let us be honest. It allows for 70% of pay at up to a maximum of €110 per day. This means when it starts, workers will get a maximum of €330 sick pay per year in the first year of the scheme. That is less than one week’s worth of the enhanced illness benefit, which has been widely and rightly criticised for being too little for many low-paid workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137"> The bottom line of my point is that if we accept that workers are genuinely sick and they have a right to sick pay, then why should that be less than their regular pay? A person cannot call the bank and ask to pay 70% of the mortgage this week because he or she is off sick. That same person cannot call the grocery shop and ask for the same deal. He or she cannot pay childcare fees on the same basis. People have lives that are built around certain income. If they are sick, they are presumably sick through no fault of their own and they should not be punished for that. Being sick is enough of a problem on its own. Therefore, we should be guaranteeing that people get 100% of their income so that they and their families can continue to survive on that basis. I will leave it there to give space to others to make a contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_1138">I have similar amendments. I agree with what an Teachta Paul Murphy has said. I want to include a reference to the need to have a GP certificate because it is a fact in this State, and I am not comparing us to every other country, that we do not have universal, free at the point of delivery access to GP care. It is not true to say the majority of low-paid workers have access to it. In fact, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has debunked that. They do not necessarily have access to a GP card.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139"> People will have 70% of a low income on their first statement and will have to put their hand in their pocket to go to a doctor. This acts as a deterrent. The point of this scheme, as the Tánaiste has said, is to be a positive thing, and it should be a positive thing, but if it does not work and people think they have to go to work because they cannot afford not to, then that defeats the purpose of the scheme. I therefore specifically included this amendment - I had another amendment on it that was ruled out of order, but we can debate that on another day - which references the need for workers to have the medical certificate. This is another financial burden on them.</p>

          <p eId="para_1140">This provision in the Bill will do more damage than anything else to its potential for success. If I am sick and I am less likely to admit to that because I will get less money and I will be paid less, I will just go to work sick. As has been outlined, it is an expensive business being sick in this country. Not only do people have to pay for a GP visit, because we do not provide that for free, unlike in other countries, there is also the cost of whatever medicines are prescribed. It is not a cheap business being sick in this country. I can see a worker who is struggling to pay the bills deciding to go into work and pretend he or she is well. That is not something any of us wants to see that happening, but that is what will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141"> We must go back to where the worker is coming from. I know the Tánaiste talks about the employer, and he is right to focus on the employer as much as we want to focus on the employee. However, if a worker who has bills to pay and children to feed thinks for a second he or she has to go to work even though he or she is sick, then this Bill will have failed. The most problematic part of this Bill is that it will be worth more to the worker to go to work sick than to avail of the provisions within the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1142">I thank the Deputies. I know some stakeholders believe the rate of payment and an earnings cap should be set in the Bill itself. I do not agree with that. Setting the rates by ministerial order allows for greater flexibility and will allow the rate to be revised as necessary in line with inflation, changing incomes and, indeed, changing politics. For example, the national minimum wage is regularly adjusted by ministerial order. Similarly, the method of calculation for payments in respect of annual leave and public holidays is also set out by regulation. It is a sensible provision that allows the Government, and indeed future Governments, to respond to changing economic circumstances without having to make all changes by way of primary legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143"> I have been clear in my medium-term plan, which is to set the rate at 70% of pay, capped at €110 per day. That figure will obviously rise now as incomes are rising. That makes sure employers know what their obligations will be. It is the principle we applied when we designed the pandemic unemployment payment, which was for roughly 70% income replacement up to a capped figure. A minimum rate entitlement will also be set to ensure all workers will receive a reasonable level of compensation. That will be similar to illness benefit. The principle behind us not making it 100%, although that would be possible under the legislation, is that the costs should be shared, approximately 70% by the employer and approximately 30% by the employee, and then by the State through illness benefit, which is funded by employers and employees as well. I need to bear in mind the very high costs that can arise for some employers, not just covering the 70% cost of somebody being out sick but also the 100% cost of the person they have to replace, and perhaps the premium they have to pay for him or her on top of that. This can therefore be a very high cost for an employer, especially if he or she has to pay to replace a member of staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144"> On GP card eligibility, I take the point that many people on low incomes do not qualify for the GP card. The solution to that is to increase eligibility for it very significantly over the next couple of years. That is something I will arguing for strongly in the forthcoming budget. While I agree with universality when it comes to the provision of healthcare, it is particularly wrong that people who go out to work every day and who are on very low incomes have to find the €60 to pay the doctor. That is not right and I hope it is something we can change in the budget. The focus up until now has been on children, but I think those on low incomes should be prioritised in the next tranche as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_1160">I move amendment No. 30:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1161">In page 11, line 22, to delete “20 weeks’” and substitute “4 weeks’”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">These amendments amend the maximum penalty the Workplace Relations Commission or Labour Court may award if an employer breaches obligations under the Bill. That now moves from 20 weeks' remuneration to four weeks' remuneration. This will bring the penalty more into line with the protections afforded to other types of leave, where the level of penalty is approximately in line with the duration of the leave concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163"> On Committee Stage, the proposal was to amend the penalty to two weeks' remuneration, but Deputies were concerned that was too little and would incentivise employers to try to avoid obligations. There may have been some misunderstanding in that regard. This penalty is in addition to employees' entitlement to their statutory sick pay and not in substitution for it. However, I recognise Deputies' concerns that a more substantial penalty should be available. On balance, we believe a penalty of 20 weeks' remuneration is disproportionate to the offence. I now propose the penalty for non-compliance should be set at four weeks' remuneration. For example, if an employer denies somebody ten days' statutory sick leave, that employer will have to pay the ten days and will also be faced with penalty of four weeks' pay in addition to that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1164">This is very mean-spirited. The penalty was 20 weeks' remuneration, which was reasonable. This has to act as a deterrent. Remember, we are not here to deal with employers who do the right thing and good employers who already provide sick leave. We are here to deal with employers who do not and for whom the law will be required to ensure they do the right thing by their workers. The 20 weeks would have acted as a deterrent, while four weeks will not.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_382">
          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1165">I am against the amendment. The original 20 weeks' remuneration was a significant punishment and deterrent for employers who did not pay. Four weeks rather than two shifts the balance slightly but, unfortunately, there will definitely be employers who will think they might get away with not paying workers their sick pay entitlements and the worst that can happen is a penalty of four weeks' pay so they will take the risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166"> This provision does not apply to employers who do the right thing and provide sick pay. This is for employers who do not do the right thing and who do not provide workers with the entitlements we are passing and saying are so important and so on. I do not see the problem with having a substantial level of potential compensation that, to be clear, shall not exceed 20 weeks' compensation. The employee does not have to be awarded 20 weeks' compensation but, if the Government's amendment passes, the maximum he or she can be awarded is four weeks' compensation, which is not enough for the employee who has to put up with all of this and has to go through the rigamarole of taking a case and so on. It is not enough of a punishment and deterrent for the employer.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1167">This amendment completely misses the disgusting nature of the intent of an employer not to pay sick pay. What kind of employer are we dealing with who would resist paying sick pay for his or her employee? In the original legislation we discussed previously, the penalty of 20 weeks seemed to me to be commensurate with the disgust we should have for such an employer. It is clear, given that the Tánaiste has come to the Chamber to amend it down to four weeks, that somebody from the employer side of things has had his ear or somebody else's. We genuinely believe this is not good enough and will be absolutely opposing the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1168">These things amount to a judgment call. My original view was the same as the Deputies in that it should be 20 weeks' remuneration but having taken advice, in particular legal advice, and heard the views of many others, we had to try to make sure the penalty was proportionate to the offence. When we looked across other legislation, for example, paternity leave, when the entitlement was two weeks' paternity leave, the penalty was two weeks. It was, in essence, 100%. If the person was not given two weeks' paternity benefit or leave, the penalty was that again. We are actually proposing to double that. If the person is not given three days' sick pay, the employer could have to bear a penalty nearly seven times that, which is 20 weeks. Even if it gets to ten days, it will still be double. It is a judgment call. We are trying to get the balance right. We believe the penalty being double the offence is proportionate and that is the thinking behind it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1169">I have one more question. The Tánaiste mentioned legal advice. What did the legal advice state? It can only state there may be a constitutional issue in respect of Deputies drafting legislation because we are clearly changing the law. I am intrigued by that.</p>

        <speech by="#LouiseOReilly" eId="spk_386">
          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1170">I would be similarly interested to hear about that but, equally, the Tánaiste said this is directly linked to the number of sick leave days a person will get. It is three days in the first instance, which will rise to ten days all being well. Is it his intention this will increase incrementally or is it four weeks and that is it?</p>

          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2022-05-18T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1171">To be clear, it is not that the legal advice is that the provision is not constitutional or we could not do it. It is that when we are drafting legislation, we should try to make sure that penalties are proportionate to the offence. That is a basic principle of justice. A more severe offence has a bigger penalty. As things stand, it is two weeks' entitlement and two weeks' penalty in respect of paternity leave. What we originally proposed for sick pay was ten days' entitlement and 20 weeks' penalty, which appeared disproportionate. We are now proposing that if somebody is not given ten days' sick pay, he or she will have to get the ten days and the penalty would be up to 20 days or four weeks. The penalty, if you like, is double the offence. If we decide to go beyond ten days, we could go up from four weeks, but it will be four weeks from day one.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_46"> The following motion was moved by Deputy David Cullinane on Tuesday, 17 May 2022:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_47">That Dáil Éireann:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_48">notes that:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_49">- in its report entitled "Report of the unannounced monitoring assessment at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, Dublin", the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) noted that "the infrastructure of the hospital, despite numerous and ongoing renovations and refurbishments, was not in line with recommended guidelines for maternity care facilities";</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_50">- in the report entitled "Overview report of HIQA's monitoring programme against the National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services, with a focus on obstetric emergencies", HIQA noted that:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_51">- 15 of the 19 units or hospitals inspected had an outdated physical infrastructure that did not meet the recommended design standards and specifications for modern maternity services;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_52">- only four maternity units and hospitals were compliant with the national standard relating to physical environment; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_53">- therefore, staff in these 15 maternity units and hospitals were providing services and care in substandard physical environments that were in need of significant upgrading and refurbishment; </summary>
        <summary eId="sum_54">- gynaecology waiting lists have increased by 45 per cent since March 2015, from 24,825 patients on active waiting lists to 36,027 in March 2022; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_55">- the number of people waiting longer than 12 months on gynaecology waiting lists has increased by 67 per cent since March 2015, from 4,127 patients to 6,889 in March 2022; </summary>
        <summary eId="sum_56">further notes that:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_57">- the Minister for Health has brought forward a proposal for the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) at Holles Street to the Elm Park Campus of St Vincent's Healthcare Group (SVHG);</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_58">- on 22nd April, 2022, the divestment of the Religious Sisters of Charity (RSC) from SVHG was completed;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_59">- the proposal for relocation is in the form of a 299-year lease of the site, and any buildings erected thereon will be owned, in freehold title, by SVHG, at the end of this lease whether in 299 years or at a sooner date due to the forfeiture or termination of the lease;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_60">- leasehold interest does not confer the comfort, control, or unencumbered rights which are inherent to freehold ownership;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_61">- the permitted use of the site under the proposed leasehold agreement is subject to the undefined and ambiguous "clinical appropriateness" test, which many clinicians, legal professionals and women have raised concern over due to its ambiguity and the potential for Court action by the landlord or by a third party which may disagree with the Health Service Executive (HSE) or NMH's interpretation at some point in the duration of the 299-year lease; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_62">- all activities at the new NMH at Elm Park are subject to a convoluted governance arrangement, involving Directors appointed by SVHG, the NMH Chartered Trust, and the Minister for Health, three separate companies with three separate constitutions, Boards and sets of Directors;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_63">furthermore, notes that:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">- two eminent members of the HSE Board, Professor Deirdre Madden, a Professor of Law specialising in Medical Law and Ethics and Deputy Chairperson of the HSE Board, and Dr Sarah McLoughlin, the Patient Advocate on the Board, have expressed a concern that "in the interests of public trust and confidence in this new project there should be absolute clarity of the separation of Church and State. This would be better achieved if the State owned the land on which the hospital was built, in line with the recommendations of the Day Report (2018),";</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_65">- Professor Madden and Dr McLoughlin further expressed that "the statement from SVHG that they must retain ownership for the delivery of integrated patient care is unsatisfactory" and further, that "the advantages of co-location could be achieved by contractual terms … without any detriment to patient care";</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_66">- the Taoiseach, in March 2021, stated in the Dáil that "I am of the view that hospitals which are predominantly or overwhelmingly funded by the State should be in State ownership. That is my view. The State now essentially supports these hospitals in all manner and means through current and capital funding … With regard to the National Maternity Hospital, my view is the ownership, control and ethos of it has to be informed by State and Government policy";</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_67">- the Tánaiste, in 2019, stated in the Dáil that "It is our policy that the hospital will be publicly owned and that the land it is on will be in public control"; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">- the Leader of the Green Party, in 2017, stated in the Dáil that the new NMH "should involve not the creation of a lease arrangement but rather the transfer of ownership of the site to the State so that there is no uncertainty or lack of clarity on the ownership"; </summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">recognises that:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">- in 2020, €338.8 million, or 67 per cent, of SVHG's revenue came from the HSE for the provision of public healthcare;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_71">- in 2020, €72.8 million, or 86 per cent, of NMH's revenue came from the HSE for the provision of public healthcare; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_72">- the State, via the HSE, will pay for the construction of the new NMH building; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_73">calls on the Government to:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_74">- pursue the full realisation of the promise that was made by the RSC to gift the land to the people of Ireland; </summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">- engage, at the highest level, with the new ownership group behind SVHG, St Vincent's Holdings CLG, to secure full public ownership of the site and new building, with all necessary safeguards, wayleaves, and guarantees to ensure the integrity, integration and highest quality of care on the site;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">- resource the National Maternity Strategy and increase capital funding, for the upgrading and refurbishment of maternity hospitals and units which are in dire need of works to meet clinical and safety standards for patient care; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">- ensure the full provision of the range of legally available sexual and reproductive health services across all relevant HSE facilities, and the advancement of accessible community-based services in this field.</summary>
