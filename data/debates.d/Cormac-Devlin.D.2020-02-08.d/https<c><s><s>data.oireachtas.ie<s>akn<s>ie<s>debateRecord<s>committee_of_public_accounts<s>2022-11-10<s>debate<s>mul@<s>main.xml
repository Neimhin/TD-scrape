          <p eId="para_10">Apologies have been received from Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carroll McNeill.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> If attending in the committee room, people are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19. Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, sends his apologies. He is represented today by Mr. Andy Harkness, director of audit, who is accompanied by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> This morning, we will engage with the following officials from Rasaíocht Con Éireann, Greyhound Racing Ireland, to examine its financial statements for 2021. We are joined by Mr. John Tuohey, interim CEO and chief financial officer, Mr. Frank Nyhan, chairman, Mr. William Fitzgerald, veterinary director, and Mr. Patrick Herbert, director of regulation. We are also joined by the following officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine: Mr. Gordon Conroy, assistant secretary general; Ms Caroline Ball, principal officer; and Ms Louise McAlavey, assistant principal officer. All of our guests are very welcome. I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards the reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. Witnesses within the precincts of Leinster House are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee. This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> I now call on Mr. Harkness to make his opening statement.</p>

          <from> Mr. Andy Harkness<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_17">Rásaíocht Con Éireann was established to provide a statutory basis for the control, regulation and development of greyhound racing in the State. Organisationally, it operates a group structure comprising the statutory body and four subsidiary companies. It operates racing at nine tracks around the State and oversees racing at a number of privately owned or operated tracks.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> Rásaíocht Con Éireann operates in one of the sectors most affected by restrictions put in place in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Its results for 2020 were substantially affected and a full recovery of activities was not achieved in 2021. As a result, Rásaíocht Con Éireann incurred a loss of €1.4 million in respect of tote betting and other race-related activities in 2021. This followed a loss from those activities of €1.8 million in 2020, and compares with a surplus of €400,000 generated from racing activities in 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> Rásaíocht Con Éireann relies substantially on Exchequer funding, and received €19.2 million in 2021, up from €16.8 million in 2020. This funding was sourced from the Agriculture, Food and the Marine Vote via the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund. The other main source of income in the year was the contributions from owners and sponsors towards racing prize money, totalling €1.9 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> On the expenditure side, Rásaíocht Con Éireann incurred costs totalling €16.7 million in 2021. This included €8 million paid out in prize money, €3.3 million spent on racing regulation, welfare, and integrity costs and €1.4 million spent on marketing and promotion. Overall, Rásaíocht Con Éireann made a surplus for the year of €3 million. The 2021 group financial statements received a clear audit opinion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_3">
          <from> Mr. John Tuohey<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_21">On behalf of Rásaíocht Con Éireann, Greyhound Racing Ireland, I thank the committee the opportunity to come before it today. I am the interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the board and I am accompanied by our chairperson, Mr. Nyhan, Mr. Fitzgerald, our veterinary director and Mr. Herbert, our director of regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> As set out in the invitation to attend, the accounts for examination before the committee today are the financial statements for Rásaíocht Con Éireann for the year ended 31 December 2021. It was a positive year for Rásaíocht Con Éireann from the greyhound racing perspective as a full racing calendar was completed consisting of 1,384 race meetings compared with 1,085 in 2020, accommodating 15,533 individual races in comparison with 11,651 in 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Some 91,778 greyhounds were entered into these races. Covid-19 restrictions severely curtailed attendances. However, 158,029 patrons attended greyhound racing events in 2021, which was an increase from 2020, when the attendance was 126,376.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> Financially, Rásaíocht Con Éireann operated prudently within budget with the aid of Government Covid-19 supports and careful cost management. The organisation is reporting an operating surplus before interest, depreciation and taxation for the year of €3.8 million, increasing from the €2.2 million surplus achieved in 2020. Food and beverage sales from stadia operated by our events and hospitality services division amounted to €0.9 million for 2021, generating a gross profit of €0.6 million. Tote turnover for the year was €7 million, with €1.7 million being received in international <i>co-mingling income. </i> The sale of media rights from race meetings generated €1.9 million in the year. Total prize money paid for the year was €8.1 million, increased from €6 million in 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Care and welfare of greyhounds is the main priority of the board and expenditure in 2021 totalled €3.3 million, increasing from €3 million in 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> The defined benefit pension scheme, which is closed to new entrants, is now closed to future accrual. The net defined benefit liability at 31 December 2021 amounted to €568,000 and a funding plan has been agreed with the trustee to address this liability. Significant improvement has been achieved in addressing the working capital deficit, moving from a negative €1.4 million at 31 December 2020 to a positive €1.4 million at 31 December 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> I once again thank the Chair for the opportunity to come before the committee. We will endeavour to respond to all members' questions. However, if there is any additional information required arising from this meeting, we will be pleased to provide that information in a prompt manner.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Dillon<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">I would like to welcome our guests from Greyhound Racing Ireland and thank them for coming before us. I will start on the issue of animal welfare. I refer to the income and expenditure accounts for the overall care and welfare programme. On the disclosure of all expenditure that has occurred in relation to greyhound welfare, why did the Accounting Officer not prepare this in a singular note so the user of the account could easily identify the type of expenditure? Can he give us an explanation on that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Mr. John Tuohey<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_29">This would be in respect of the two categories - the racing regulation welfare and laboratory integrity and governance section and then, separately, the greyhound care fund. Are those the two items the Deputy is referring to?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanDillon" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Deputy Alan Dillon<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_30">That is correct. The care fund, specifically.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_7">
          <from> Mr. John Tuohey<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_31">The background to the care fund dates from 2019 when it was established with the purpose of ringfencing certain income which would then be used specifically for greyhound care fund purposes. That income was to come from 10% of gate receipts, 5% of net tote revenue and 50% of most of our sponsorship. We then expended those funds in specific categories of expenditure around fostering, welfare homes and those areas. That was the reason that we identify it as a separate line on the income and expenditure account.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanDillon" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Deputy Alan Dillon<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_32">Perhaps Mr. Tuohey can give us the breakdown of the welfare expenditure for 2020 and 2021.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_9">
          <from> Mr. John Tuohey<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_33">The majority of the expenditure in 2020, approximately €1 million of it, was in respect of a Covid support scheme that we brought in to effectively assist in feeding the greyhounds while racing was suspended. It was €2 per day per racing greyhound. In total it came to just under €1 million. The other aspects of it were in relation to the fostering and so on.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanDillon" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Deputy Alan Dillon<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_34">For 2020, the expenditure was €1.1 million. What was the total expenditure for 2021?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_11">
          <from> Mr. John Tuohey<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_35">In 2021, the total expenditure from the fund was €523,000.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanDillon" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Deputy Alan Dillon<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_36">Okay. We have a drop there of €668,000.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_13">
          <from> Mr. John Tuohey<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_37">It is specifically because in 2020 we had to expend additional funds during the period when the greyhounds were not racing. The Deputy will see also that our prize money was reduced in 2020 compared to 2022, and that is where the greyhound owners and trainers receive their income.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">Does Mr. Tuohey have an estimate for 2022 in terms of what percentage of overall expenditure is utilised on animal welfare?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_17">
          <from> Mr. John Tuohey<recordedTime time="2022-11-10T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>

          <p eId="para_44">The Greyhound Racing Act 2019 chiefly assigns Greyhound Racing Ireland as the promoters and developers of greyhound racing in Ireland. The Irish Kennel Club is very much based on greyhound breeds. It has its own microchipping database as well. In Greyhound Racing Ireland, the registrations are carried out through the offices of the Irish Coursing Club, which is based in Clonmel. It is the statutory appointed body that looks after all areas of registration, breeding, mating, whelping and litter registration. Chiefly, under the provisions of the 2019 Act, we are the purveyors of racing regulation and welfare maintenance relating to the greyhound industry. We also have authorised officers under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 in addition to being operators Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, which is the only set of statutory legislation in this country chiefly assigned to one canine breeds, that being greyhounds.</p>

We have regulations and I assure the Deputy we have ramped up our regime on welfare adherence and regulation.

          <p eId="para_77">In the process of rehoming these greyhounds, each individual application goes through a process of assessing whether the dog is the right fit for the person or family. This includes home checks and conversations with prospective owners as to whether it is a good fit for them. Their level of experience of owning a dog is assessed as is what having a greyhound in their life would mean and the changes they may expect as a result. This is particularly acute at present. I am quite sure the Deputy has seen reports not only from us but from other rehoming charities, specifically Dogs Trust, on dogs being surrendered. Dogs were taken into homes during the Covid pandemic but surrendered when people returned to work in the office. The transition from being a racing dog to a retired dog is a two-pronged process. It is not only about getting the dog prepared but also that the people who take the dogs in know exactly what they are dealing with.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">Initially, the Jim Power report was commissioned in 2021. The economic benefit on an overall basis was highlighted in a number of categories within that report. It is primarily of benefit in rural Ireland, where the greyhound racing community, owners and trainers are primarily based. It is in their local economies. It is also a spin-off where the stadiums are based, so employment is generated directly and indirectly from all of the stadiums. Obviously, that is not confined purely to rural Ireland. Shelbourne Park is our flagship stadium, located in Dublin, and it is the largest generator of income from an events and hospitality perspective.</p>

It is a very fluid thing when bitches come into season and greyhounds are laid off from the racing period.

          <p eId="para_93">Okay. From the perspective of the future of greyhound racing, the number of dogs produced is a concern for animal rights activists. I am sure the witnesses are going to hear a lot more about that today. What work could be done, within reason and not damaging the sport, to try to improve the transparency around breeding and reduce the number of dogs in breeding? If that were done, would there be consequences for the level of meetings and the income for the organisation? That is a question that needs to be asked for those who are unfamiliar with the sport. The vast majority of the Irish public do not have any in-depth knowledge of greyhound racing.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">It is not insignificant that we would have seen a decline in breeding during Covid. Thankfully, numbers are returning at the moment. The Deputy may or may not be aware that all brood bitches in this country are DNA profiled. All whelps, in addition to being microchipped under national legislation, are ear tattooed and identified that way as well. I mentioned the Welfare of Greyhounds Act. It specifically provides for a code of practice, which we published in November of last year and which sets out provisions for the absolute minimum care for greyhounds and how they should be maintained. That covers all greyhounds - retired, racing, the whole lot. That statutory legislation is the only legislation in this country that is specifically directed towards one canine breed. There are provisions in that legislation for breaches in how greyhounds are kept. Our board takes a very serious view of any cases that come before the courts deals with people accordingly.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">We are seeing a strong recovery in attendances this year. At the end of October, on an overall basis we had in excess of 250,000 people attending the meetings. There has been a strong recovery. We are obviously targeting to improve that further. Post Covid, it was a good outcome because people were a little reticent to return to crowded areas and so on.

          <p eId="para_98">I will return to the issue of the studbook. I asked this question and I would expect to get a proper answer. The level of dogs being bred per year is a huge concern. That would be the view of the general public overall. If you were to take a straw poll of a random sample of the population, I am sure that is what would come back as the biggest problem. Could Greyhound Racing Ireland do anything to try to tighten that up or increase the regulatory standards? Could the witnesses look at that and come forward with a plan? It is the way business is done in the racing industry with horses. I know the breeding of dogs is very different and obviously involves a different number of pups being born. A horse normally has one foal but that is not the case with a dog or bitch. Is that something that could be looked at, to try to bolster the level of accreditation and confidence in greyhound racing in this country? That should be done, if it can be.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">We are always looking at areas to try to improve standards, whether that is in how greyhounds are kept, breeding standards, racing standards or welfare initiatives. It is important to note that there is also an active export market for greyhounds. That is supported by the numbers being bred. In 2017 there were 6,767 Irish-bred greyhounds registered in the UK, which would have been exported there.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">The number decreased in 2021 to 5,882. That is a sizable proportion. Over 80% of greyhounds that race in the UK are of Irish extraction. There is active support for owners and breeders in this country and an active, fluid market which exports greyhounds to the UK. It is an important part of the greyhound industry. It provides support and a rationale for the numbers being bred in this country.</p>

There were two meetings which we do not forget lightly. I am glad to see there have been some changes, with a new financial controller coming in a couple of years ago. I understand a new commercial director has been appointed and will be in place early next year. I regret that the CEO left, because I think things were beginning to change. The process to appoint someone is ongoing. I hope whoever is appointed has a lot of commercial sense and knowledge of the whole racing industry because it is specific knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> I have questions regarding figures. In the 2021 report, prize money is given at €8.1 million. I want to get a sense of this.

          <p eId="para_108">I know what Mr. Tuohey is saying and respect that. I am trying to get to how much from the horse and greyhound racing fund, which contributes to the organisation, is used for paying prize money versus running the organisation. By my calculation, while one can argue the toss over a couple of those contributions, that fund, which was set up to deliver prize money, was used for approximately a 70:30 split between running the organisation and the prize fund over a few years. Horse Racing Ireland is the only organisation to compare this with. It spends approximately 65% on prize money. The organisation is taking up a vast amount of the fund. Is that fair to say?</p>

          <p eId="para_109">I would not agree. The activity of greyhound racing is generating the income. Other commercial activities are taking place. We generate income and revenue from events and hospitality. It would not be fair to say that it should be deducted from the money paid from the fund. If we generated no income from the media rights, the prize money would still be provided to races.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">I appreciate that, but the bottom line is that approximately 70% of the fund given to Greyhound Racing Ireland from the tax created by the Government is used to run the organisation. In any scenario, that is lopsided. The only organisation to compare with is Horse Racing Ireland, which spends 35% on the organisation and 65% on the prize fund. I allowed for Covid. The previous figures go to nearly an 80:20 split, while the previous year is a 65:35 split. The point is a large majority of the funding is used for running the organisation rather than for prize money.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> Page 28 is on media and other income. There is a sum of €65,500. Why is SIS funding not in this part of the report on media and other income? Page 28 indicates that there was a loss of €1.48 million from racing activities. Why is that not part of this? Why is the spending on SIS not here?</p>

          <p eId="para_116">One would need to look specifically at what is contained within our category of marketing expenditure. It is not purely marketing campaigns.

          <p eId="para_117">I appreciate that and Mr. Tuohey's honesty. In my eyes, if one added the marketing activities and the SIS revenue, it would be €3.381 million for a marketing spend of €1.469 million if one adds the coverage through SIS and the marketing. It is extraordinary to have spent €1.469 million on marketing for a loss of €3.381 million. I will move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> I have a question for the Department officials. Concerns have been expressed here and in reports about the board. I know a new CEO is being appointed. Best of luck to the interim CEO who is doing the job. In every Department, there are certain criteria when it comes to appointing people to boards, as well as the Public Appointments Service, which was the right thing to bring in. There is a concern that there is not actually anybody on the board with distinctive, extensive knowledge of the industry. Is the Department concerned about that? How does it know that the board has enough knowledge to adapt greyhound racing to modern times?</p>

Some of the numbers imply that the dogs are in Ireland until they are at 24 months old. That is not the case, is it? Thus we are six months short on some of these numbers. If one looks at the number provided to Jim Power, Greyhound Racing Ireland is counting them as still being in Ireland at 24 months but, in reality, they might be exported to the UK at 18 months.</p>

Based on the report, there is double counting of numbers in terms of pups, the dog pool and exports. It does not add up. It seems this industry is not about racing at all but about breeding, as some 85% of dogs in the UK are from Ireland. Irish greyhound racing is a peripheral industry to the breeding industry. It goes directly to the United Kingdom and is propping up the gambling industry there, which is a £2.7 billion industry. I do not know if they need €19 million of Irish taxpayers' money to prop up their gambling.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">Okay. The particular figure is with regard to €250,000 in respect of capital debt forgiven. That was the figure that was written off. It is not a figure of €0.5 million. To explain, that particular item was historical debt that dated back to 2012 and 2013 when expenditure was being incurred in the development of the Clonmel stadium. At that time, it received a grant for the works that were being done. There was a shortfall in the order of €250,000 to complete the project. The particular circumstances are that Rásaíocht Con Éireann owns the greyhound stadium in Clonmel. We lease it to a private company called Davis Road Greyhound Stadium on a long-term sporting lease. The money that was spent at the time on that building is in respect of a building that is ultimately owned by Rásaíocht Con Éireann. It should maybe have been structured differently at the time. Having not being around at the particular time, it was probably treated as a loan to finish the job to try to ensure that all the works were completed.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">I have previously discussed the next matter with the witnesses at this committee or at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I do not understand why Greyhound Racing Ireland accepts the funding model to which it is tied. We could debate whether it gets too much or too little and people will have their own views on that, but the funding it receives annually is directly linked to what another organisation receives. I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General whether there is anything even remotely similar anywhere else in the public finances, but he could not think of any. Why has the board accepted this position and not sought to have it changed?</p>

Automatically, Greyhound Racing Ireland's funding would be reduced. If the Department decided that the greyhound racing sector needed to be maintained at €18 million per annum, HRI would get €70 million even though there was an adjudication that it only needed €60 million.

It is important that the industry or sector - "sector" is a better word; "industry" is not good when talking about dogs - should have its reputation protected. I do not have a problem with it once animal welfare is looked after. We want it to be successful. The traceability is there from 12 weeks on.

          <p eId="para_540">I will interject because I knew the Chairman would go down this road. I do not accept that there is mass culling of pups in this country. I fundamentally do not accept that. The traceability system and our increased care and welfare programme have addressed many of the issues. I am not saying there were not issues in the past but we have made significant inroads. I have mentioned before that we are not a perfect industry. We have made considerable inroads in the area of care and welfare. It is no accident that it is the chief focus of our current board. It is also the chief focus of the strategic plan to which the chairman alluded earlier on. It is to the forefront of this. If this is industry is to have any longevity, let there be no doubt among the members, the clear war chest of the industry has to be the care and welfare of the greyhounds in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_554">It is important to note that the traceability system refers to racing greyhounds in this country for which we are responsible for by statute. It does not relate to coursing greyhounds. However, we capture information on whelping; location; controller; age; sex; and microchip to age two. We also capture information on the death, sale and export of greyhounds and their retirement as a pet and potential for racing. We have the ability to edit details such as change of location, loss, theft and provision of a routine update of when they are kennels or transfer location. More importantly, there is a provision that anybody who does not comply with the updates that are required of traceability is immediately suspended from entering greyhounds at tracks and does not get the option to draw down any past prize money won.</p>

          <p eId="para_580">When one goes through the accounts, it is very difficult to break down the welfare spend. Some €524,000 went into the greyhound care fund in 2021. That is a decrease of €668,000 from 2020. There was €464,000 and €235,000 for both years for the retired greyhound fund. Will you provide us with a simple note for the three years to break down how the care fund is funded and managed? How does the money go in and out? I cannot figure it out and there seems to be a considerable decrease from one year to the other. That cannot explained by Covid because care has to happen regardless of Covid.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">In relation to private tracks and in respect of subsidies for private tracks versus the money that is sent into public tracks, can we get the breakdown of how much funding and how many employees, both full-time and part-time, there are across every track in Ireland? I ask this so that we can see that subsidies or moneys that are given to each track, whether it is public or private, as well as the number of employees. That information would be interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> My last question is in relation to attendance. This is probably a question for the chairman or for the chief executive. The targeted attendance for race meetings is 630,000. Now that we have come out of Covid-19, do they think this will be achievable?</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> Another question that I get asked a lot is that there seems to be a huge number of concessionary tickets when it comes to greyhound venues. The witnesses have produced figures regarding revenues and attendance records but if they deduct the concessions, what would they then be? Can they provide us with a table on that per year, if possible, particularly in relation to Shelbourne Park for the last three years? </p>
          <p eId="para_595"> My last question is probably to the chairman and is on the issue of greyhound racing and coursing. Are there any plans to try to draw a distinction between the two? That is my last question. I think it would be supportive of the greyhound racing fraternity and the ethos of that, as well as the issue of people attending races and community groups and families attending race groups and not being concerned about welfare. Has any work been done on that or is it in gestation?</p>

          <p eId="para_598">The two have diverged in separate ways along their own ways. Both industries are regulated but we have diverged. The strategic focus of Greyhound Racing Ireland has been in developing its own industry from a regulatory perspective. Many of the legacy issues, such as consent to exclusion orders and issues like that were contained in the 1958 Act and involved the direct input of the Irish Coursing Club in such regulatory matters, have been dispensed with and addressed in the Greyhound Racing Act 2019. Section 28 additionally provides for the traceability system, which was heretofore unheard of. All such matters had been previously managed by the Irish Coursing Club from a registration perspective. The 2019 Act gives us the statutory basis to do what the Deputy is talking about-----</p>

          <p eId="para_630">I would put it to the Department that it is a basic principle of a traceability scheme that we all know what is happening. If I cannot look up a dog and check what has happened to them, it is problematic. It is not truly transparent, and it is not something that we can rely on.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> I want to go back to the numbers that the chairman raised because we have established in earlier contributions that on average every year, 14,000 to 15,000 pups are born. Mr. Herbert told me earlier that 4,500 of those go to racing, 5,800 to go export and 2,000 are rehomed. That leaves 2,500 that are unaccounted for. </p>

          <p eId="para_678">I have a question for Mr. Tuohey. I said the initial figure for debt owing for Clonmel was €500,000. We have the capital debt, but then there was a figure of €277,000 that reduced to €212,000 in 2021. Does that have to be paid before the lease expires or before it is renewed?</p>

          <p eId="para_681">There are a number of elements to the Clonmel debt. In order to create a solid repayment schedule, there is an agreement relating to a telecoms mast that is in the greyhound stadium. The income from the mast was originally going to the Davis Road Greyhound Stadium company. That was legally reassigned to RCÉ. The income from that is €18,000 per annum. Over a ten-year period, that was to take care of €180,000 of the debt. It was ring-fenced as part of an overall agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_687"> I want to come back to the issue of the CEO. There is no point in beating around the bush. The elephant in the room is that there have been a number of rolling CEOs and nobody lasts for very long. It is an industry that is just like Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, when it comes in here, in that the whole industry is based on integrity. The integrity of the industry is what allows the funding and the transparency but when we have CEOs who only last for six months, it does not bode well for the sector as a whole. What concerns me is that when Deputy Carthy asked Mr. Nyhan if an exit interview was done, the answer was "No". Mr. Nyhan is a professional man - I was in that profession for eight years - and nobody could credibly say they did not carry out an exit interview with a CEO who only lasted six months. Is there a reason he did not do an exit interview?</p>

I thought we worked very well together. I was very disappointed when she left, but I must say she co-operated fully in the handover. She was present and assisted until Mr. Tuohey took over.

          <p eId="para_697">No, but there has been quite a number over a ten-year period. It is a concern for me when people in the sector say that it is an issue. What they frequently say is that they need somebody with experience of the sector as the CEO.</p>

          <p eId="para_698">It is also a concern for me because I am a non-executive chairman and I would like to stay as a non-executive chairman. The vast sums of money the Minister pays me do not mean that I can be an executive chairman. I am as interested as everybody else in getting a person into this role. We have gone through two rounds of a very vigorous interview process and I am pretty confident that we will find ourselves with a very good CEO before the end of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_699">My concern is we have one who lasts. My point is whether Mr. Nyhan takes on board that there should be someone with sectoral experience in the role. Before I became a politician, I came from a very difficult sector. It is a role that I can say here and now that nobody understands if they are not in the sector. I refer to road transport. One could not come in as a CEO with a business degree and just operate it. One must have an understanding of the sector. I am not saying that is the case; Mr. Nyhan's own patrons are saying it.</p>

          <p eId="para_700">It would be helpful for a new chief executive to have some knowledge of the industry. I would say to Deputy Murphy, however, that Ger Dollard, who did a very good job and I do not think anybody would characterise him as other than a good chief executive, had no experience of the industry before he joined. It really does depend on the character of the individual and their capacity to learn and get involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_722">Greyhound Racing Ireland has supplied some information around turnover, attendance and various other figures. It appears there has been a significant drop-off since 2010. I would like to see the graph going the other way. It is an important sector. The turnover in 2010 was €33 million. Granted, the figures for 2020 and 2021 are not real figures because of Covid but if you look at 2019, turnover was down in the region of €22 million or €23 million. That is a significant drop off in turnover.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> I looked at the surplus each year. There was a spike in 2018 but that was due to the sale of Harold's Cross. There was a bump there that managed to stabilise Greyhound Racing Ireland's finances.

Attendances are rising, greyhound racing is back on television and sponsors are getting involved again.

          <p eId="para_732">In response to Deputy Colm Burke earlier, I said that part of the plan would be to reduce our dependence on State funding. Obviously, a significant part of that has to involve increasing attendances. The Chairman asked about the period from 2009 onwards, which was probably the nadir in terms of attendances. A number of things happened. Public practices and habits changed. People stopped going out as much as they did previously and started watching greyhound racing and other sports on television and elsewhere and there was a change in public perception of dogs and their treatment. We were probably slow to react to public perception. In the past few years, we have changed our emphasis entirely and moved to an emphasis on the welfare of the dog, an emphasis that has always been there but has never been properly publicised. Once we have established that in the minds of the general public, we can start tackling the question of attendance but we had to do that first and I hope we have done that.</p>

          <p eId="para_733">Attendances in 2019, which is the last realistic year by which you can judge this, went down to 463,000. Rasaíocht Con Éireann aims to get that up to 630,000. The last time this figure was seen was in 2015. If we go back to 2008, over 1.1 million people attended race meetings. It is significant. We are looking at less than 40% of that figure. That is a shocking figure in terms of commercial activity and the promotion of the sector. Would Mr. Nyhan agree with that?</p>

          <p eId="para_734">I agree with the Chairman. This is a big shortfall to be made up. I do not think we will ever get back to those attendance figures because public habits have changed. Our sister organisation Horse Racing Ireland has the same issue. I do not think people are going to go out as often so we are going to have to look at other revenue streams.</p>

          <p eId="para_736">2021 was an average year in terms of numbers. The Chairman mentioned 2015. To be helpful, the attendances at this year's Derby final and the Laurels final in Cork last week were back at 2015 levels.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">That is good. However, if we take the last year for which we can realistically assess the attendance it is 463,000 and there is an average of, say, 1,400 race meetings per year, that tells us the attendance at race meetings is in the region of perhaps 300 per meeting. Would that be correct, as an average?</p>

          <p eId="para_739">There is a difficulty with that in that some meetings are not really run for the public. Some of the races, like Sports Information Services, SIS-type races, are run early in the morning, on Sunday afternoon and other times like that which are not public-friendly. Therefore, it does not work out as a straight average.</p>

The first item is the minutes of our meeting of 27 October, which have been circulated to members. Do members wish to raise any matters in regard to the minutes? If not, are the minutes agreed? Agreed. As usual, they will be published on the committee’s web page.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> The next item is accounts and financial statements. Three sets of accounts and financial statements were laid before the Houses between 24 and 31 October 2022. I ask Mr. Harkness to address these before I open the floor to members.</p>

          <p eId="para_916">The first accounts relate to the National Concert Hall, which received a clear audit opinion for 2021. Attention is drawn in the audit report to the recognition of the deferred funding pension asset, which occurs in a number of bodies. The second is the Insurance Compensation Fund for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion. The third is the Social Insurance Fund for 2021, which, again, received a clear audit opinion. The Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to a number of matters that were detailed in his recent annual report on public services. The first is the chapter on welfare payments and excessive entitlement. The second is the Department's process to recover social welfare payments from compensation awards. The third is an examination of the classification of workers for PRSI purposes and related matters. I understand those chapters will come before the committee in due course.</p>

          <p eId="para_921">Are the first and the second parts of the financial statements agreed? Agreed. As usual, those two will be published as part of the minutes. We will hold back the third one until next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> We now move to correspondence. As previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated to members. Decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee’s meetings and published on the committee’s web page. The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is that from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> We begin with No. 1532 from Kerstin Mey, president, University of Limerick, UL, dated 20 October 2022. This is information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement. The committee has a standing agreement to request explanations for instances of significant non-compliant procurement which the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to, that is, procurement in excess of €500,000 in a given set of accounts that is not in compliance with procurement rules and guidelines. This response provides an explanation for, and steps taken to address, non-compliant procurement in UL, which amounted to €551,000 in its 2020-2021 financial statements. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Is that agreed? I note Deputy Devlin is contributing remotely. Does he wish to raise anything on this point?</p>

          <p eId="para_926">There is a table outlining the issues involved. There were several issues, including one in regard to website hosting. I asked why that was not previously tendered. UL said it is under review but I want to ask what the term “under review” means. In any given locality, there are a number of people who do website hosting. Another point concerned occupational health assessments, occupational therapy assessments and safety officers’ reports. UL is currently reviewing that and it is said that it will be progressed. Another issue concerned landscaping works to a value of €30,000, which was also to be progressed. I want to ask why it was not tendered up to date. We want an update on those three issues of website hosting, occupational therapy assessments and the turf and landscaping suppliers. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> The next category is correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence. First is No. 1549 from Deputy Hourigan, dated 27 October 2022. It is a proposal for the committee to consider reports of the HSE’s former CEO being approached by a consultancy firm. It has been reported that while approaches have been made, there are no commitments, although the consultancy firm is reported to have stated that there may be some advisory work next year. We could write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to request information regarding what is termed a cooling-off period, which I think is two years. There was a lot of talk about this a few years ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_928">I am sorry but I asked the Chair yesterday whether we could look at contracts having exactly such a cooling-off period. That is not what they are called but it is the same thing. I do not know how it has not arisen in all of the reports that this might be undertaken. It does not make any sense to me that senior executives can apportion contracts and be involved in tender processes and then go to work for those who benefited from them. It is outrageous.</p>

          <p eId="para_931">The former chief executive of the HSE was here with the committee fairly recently, just a few weeks ago. Deputy Hourigan wrote to the committee to raise the engagement of the former chief executive of the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid, who stepped down last month, with the consultancy firm Ernst &amp; Young in respect of advisory work.</p>

          <p eId="para_932">I am saying we should consider the appropriateness of the timing. It is outside consultancy rather than direct employment in this case. Even if it is not prohibited, it certainly should be for the future. We probably need to look at this. One way or the other, we need to write and find out if it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_943">That it is particularly so when they move into an area related to their work here. That is fine. There is one other matter in respect of correspondence. It has not been flagged for consideration but I just want to mention a response we have received from St. James's Hospital, No. R1534B, dated 19 October. It concerns a request for an explanation of non-compliant procurement. The reply states that €395,000 is accounted for but non-compliant procurement noted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit certificate amounted to 14% of €207 million, amounting to the sum of approximately €29 million. The hospital has given us tables relating to €395,000. The problem is that what we are actually seeking clarification on procurement in the region of €29 million. Members will see on the table attached to the reply that a breakdown is given of six different items or services that were procured but, as I have said, this expenditure only comes to €395,000 whereas the actual figure we are seeking clarification on is the full 14% of non-pay expenditure, which is a figure in the region of €29 million. Does any member wish to address this? I propose that we write back to the hospital seeking an explanation for that because we got an explanation for €400,000 when the figure is €29 million. In fairness to the hospital, there may be legitimate reasons this expenditure cannot be tendered for. It may be a case of sole suppliers or specialised services that are only available from one provider. That may be the case but we need to know.</p>

In the morning we have an engagement with the Department of Social Protection and, in the afternoon session, we have the operator of the national lottery. There is a differentiation there. We will have the regulator in one week and the actual operator the following week. On 8 December, we have the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The final meeting for this year is scheduled for 15 December and is with the Office of Public Works. We also agreed to meet with An Bord Pleanála in the first sitting in the new year, on 19 January.
