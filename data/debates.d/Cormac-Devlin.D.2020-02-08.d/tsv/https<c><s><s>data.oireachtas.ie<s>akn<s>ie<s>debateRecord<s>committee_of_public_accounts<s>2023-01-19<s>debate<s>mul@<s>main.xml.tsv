CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Unfortunately, I missed the opening statements. I was at a committee meeting as well. Forgive me if I go over questions that have been asked already. I want to touch on the AHBs initially. How many AHBs are there in the State at present?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are there any outside of that framework?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the final figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What oversight is there of their mechanisms to draw down funding, such as CALF and CAS and all the other schemes mentioned? Is AHBRA fully responsible for the governance of the AHBs or are they individually responsible as commercial entities? How does that work?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are all of the 450 registered? Is that how they are deemed to be in operation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What volume of queries about processes and complaints has the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority as regulator been dealing with?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Without going into individual detail, were those complaints made by tenants, councils or organisations? Will Ms Lyons shed some light on them?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Have the three concerns from 2021 been dealt with and closed or are they ongoing cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My next question is for the Housing Agency. What funding has gone to the 450 AHBs collectively and what funding do they generate themselves?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Baneham not have a figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If Ms Lyons does not mind sending that to the committee as a note after the meeting, that would be very helpful. Will the Housing Agency give an update on the development of each of the eight sites Mr. Baneham referred to that were transferred to the land aggregation scheme at the end of 2020?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. The development of eight sites was referred to.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, that is fine. Can anyone speak about those sites that were transferred to the LDA or is that outside the witnesses' remit?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Sixty-five sites were to be transferred out of the land aggregation scheme. Have any been transferred at this point?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. Baneham send a note to the committee on the remaining 60 sites? It does not have to be too detailed. If he included the size of each site and whether they are serviced, that might be helpful.
