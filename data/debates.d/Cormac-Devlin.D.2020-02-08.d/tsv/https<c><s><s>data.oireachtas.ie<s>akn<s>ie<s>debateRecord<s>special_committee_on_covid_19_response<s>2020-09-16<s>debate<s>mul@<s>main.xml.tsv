CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Professor Kelleher very much for her opening statement and for the report before us. She outlined the number of nursing homes. We discussed inspections previously at the committee with Nursing Homes Ireland and others and we had HIQA in recently speaking about the number of inspections it carried out.Does she think there was an adequate number of inspections of all care settings during the initial stages of the pandemic?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witness. Regarding staffing provision, a crucial issue that came to light in my constituency of DÃºn Laoghaire, and presumably throughout the country, which we are also seeing in schools now, is where somebody presents with symptoms, relief cover is needed. That is essential, particularly in a care setting such as a nursing home or other facility. Graph 3.3 on page 29 of the report refers to the incidence rates. A comparison is drawn between counties Cavan, Monaghan, Westmeath and Longford and the lower number of cases in counties Waterford and Galway. Equally, on page 41, table 3.10, reference is made to the high incidence among healthcare workers in counties Dublin, Cavan, Louth and Monaghan in comparison to counties Waterford and Galway. What, in Dr. Kelleher's opinion, was the difference between those areas?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I turn to the discharges from hospital. The report states 10,710 individuals were discharged from nursing or convalescence homes, or long-stay accommodation and 401 had either caught or already had Covid, and 11 were probable cases. Can Dr. Kelleher elaborate on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Professor Twomey for that but in terms of the number of individuals who were transferred either from a hospital setting to a nursing home or a long-stay facility, was he able to establish if they were tested prior to leaving hospital, which for me would be a critical point?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Professor Twomey for that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Professor Kelleher. On that point, it brings into focus chapter 5, which examined the learning from Covid to establish the extent to which nursing homes are better prepared. The witnesses might delve into the recommendations under chapter 5. The supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, at a very early stage - Professor Kelleher mentioned February and it was new to everybody at that point - took some time to filter to either public or private nursing homes. The witnesses might comment on that, too, in response to my final question.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their attendance today. I will start with a question for Mr. Walsh regarding his opening statement. He mentioned that the HSE actions in this report will be worked on with the Department of Health and other partners to implement the recommendations that require policy change and/or policy development. For clarity, how do the Department of Health and the HSE work together and what subtle differences are there between the two bodies that require co-ordination?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the recommendations made in the report before us, whose ultimate role will it be to see its implementation? Is it the Department, the HSE or another?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In her opening statement, Dr. MacLellan mentioned the extension to the temporary financial support scheme. Specifically, what does this cover? Does it cover staff supports and staff cover, as the previous speaker asked?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Walsh referred to the winter plan. How confident are we as a nation that we have enough PPE for the winter months? How confident are we regarding its supply and distribution and ensuring it gets to the various services speedily?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My next question relates to our earlier session with the expert panel. There were more than 400 discharges from hospitals into congregated settings, including nursing homes, care facilities and long-stay facilities. I need assurances that anybody discharged from an acute setting will be tested. I would like confirmation on this from the relevant witness.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Reference was made to the bilateral group. Is that the same as the implementation framework group or is it separate? How many meetings of the bilateral group have taken place to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to services for older people. When will community social day care settings resume?
