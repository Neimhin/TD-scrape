CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Cahill and Mr. Callery are very welcome. I will focus first on their opening statement, which is welcome and represents great progress. I am from the neighbouring county council area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. Since 2016 onwards, there have been many similarities between what my council and Wicklow County Council have been doing. I am familiar with the work of my council. It is great to read about the work of Wicklow County Council. I commend it on the work it has done. On the AIPP, which is of interest to me, the witnesses highlighted two of the objectives it contains. In particular, they referred to making public land pollinator friendly. Can they elaborate on how that is being done? Mr. Callery mentioned the Let’s Get Buzzing event and a few other initiatives. He specifically mentioned pollinator-friendly corridors, the use of which we need to encourage. One can work in that regard with communities and Tidy Towns groups, both of which are very in tune with this and want to see this progress. On the other side of the equation, and this is something the committee has discussed, are the complaints that the council also probably receives because a pollinator-friendly corridor may look a little bit more untidy to what people may have become used to. Where signage is put up, people understand what is being done and may be encouraged to participate as a result. Can I ask the witnesses comment on that matter? On the use of chemicals and glyphosate, when mentioning the products and equipment to control weeds and clean hard surfaces, our guests specifically referred to the hiring of contractors. Let us be honest. There is a cost associated with this. It is cheaper and possibly quicker to use a chemical-based approach, but there are obviously long-term effects, whereas the cost of hiring a contractor for two days may have an immediate effect but does not have the same long-lasting effect of the weeds growing back in the next growth season. Can the witnesses comment on the costs in that regard? We need that information because we want to see this kind of initiative rolled out across the country. As the Chairman stated, this has come to us through Mr. Walsh and the work he has undertaken. Thankfully, our engagement with local authorities seems to be that they are all on the same page here. That is good news. We have to talk about the cost and the circumstances in which it is prohibitive. I understand what our witnesses are saying about circumstances where a chemical-based solution has to be used because I can see the relevant information on the application form they sent to us in advance. How many applications to use chemicals have been submitted and what level of chemicals are being used in spite of all of the good efforts that have been made? I have many other questions on these issues, but I will leave it at those for moment. I will come back in later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I hear our witnesses comments on the costs, which is understandable. I raise the issue of the use of glyphosate where there are large weeds growing on the kerb sides, footpaths or whatever.Over time, they can do damage. Ms Cahill mentioned invasive species doing damage to infrastructure, etc. She mentioned colleagues in departments like roads who may want these weeds removed sooner than other people would want. She also mentioned Tidy Towns and residents groups requesting the same. Where that situation arises, what is the best practice learned so far? I accept these things will change. When pesticides or herbicides need to be used, how much have been used so far, by way of granting? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Hogweed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The chemicals being used for those-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that. It is trial and error. Ms Cahill highlighted in her statement the sharing of information both between Departments and between local authorities. She mentioned Louth, Kildare and a few others. How frequent is that sharing of information? I have personal experience of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown but others are further along the road - excuse the pun - and more aware of what things worked. Ms Cahill mentioned hot foam. When I was on the council I raised it. The cost of glyphosate versus the cost of a machine means it is a good few years of expenditure before it washes its face. Did Ms Cahill say the council bought one or is buying one?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	So it has made the investment
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Cahill said there was the appointment of an external contractor to carry out the mechanical weed removal, and it raised IR issues, which was inevitable I presume. Wicklow County Council will not be the only council with that issue. As the Chairman said, there are other options in terms of utilising or repurposing some of the council's equipment.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I return to the "Do"s and "Don't"s the council has established, which Ms Cahill raised in her opening remarks. The third point concerned the use of alternative chemicals and glyphosate-free products. We have raised this here before and I raised it with the Department when it was before the committee.What is the process for the council to procure non-chemically-based products? There is quite a large range of them on the market. What is the process in which the council engages to secure and procure those products?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is no bulk-buying of any particular chemical-free products.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If a member of the outdoor staff decides to trial a product that is chemical-free, there will be a trial area and it might be found that it works. What happens then if the council wants to purchase the product on a large scale, given it has five municipal district areas?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fair enough. The reason I asked that has nothing to do with Wicklow specifically. It is to get our heads around the way in which we can get local authorities to explore non-chemically-based products. While there is big investment of €30,000 in Foamstream and other materials that the council has to acquire, there are products which could do what we want that are non-invasive and non-chemically based, and we should be looking at them. They may ultimately be cheaper than the products or materials the witnesses are talking about. We are going to return to that and it might be something we specifically examine in our report. I greatly appreciate the engagement of the witnesses, not only with the committee in written format, but also the oral presentation today and the engagement on this very important topic. I do not think it gets enough discussion on a national basis. With specific regard to the remits of the two witnesses, graffiti removal is costly yet there are alternative ways of getting rid of it. Does the Wicklow local authority still provide kits for graffiti removal? I know some had done so in the past but do they still do that? I know I am somewhat off-topic.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I presume it is more prominent in the north of the county than elsewhere. In saying that, what other methods are used? Is it mainly voluntary?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is really down to municipal district level. Would Mr. Callery be aware of the involvement of the Probation Service in regard to the removal of graffiti?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would this trial period be something the council could use to engage with the Probation Service? I am thinking in terms of cost and a process in which, right across the country, local authorities which are engaging in this could be helped to avail of some manual labour through the Probation Service?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	To go back to the all-Ireland pollinator plan and best practice use of pesticides, reference was made to 77 different types of bees, for example. In tandem with what we are talking about today, and in tandem with the council’s pollinator targets as a county, how is the council monitoring the progress of that? From 2016, there has been a six-year window for monitoring the impact that the pollinator plan, “slow to mow” and all of these other initiatives are having. How are they being monitored year on year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The witnesses will be aware of the new investment with the National Parks and Wildlife Service on the encouraging of biodiversity. We have to monitor where we are going with this to ensure what we are doing and the learnings Ms Cahill is talking about are monitored so we know how we are progressing. I will move to my final questions. I again thank both witnesses for their attendance today. In terms of the pesticide course they spoke of, how many of the staff in Wicklow County Council have attended that course? One of the documents mentioned that staff have to register with the Department once the course is done. Of the members of staff who have attended the course, have they all registered? Is the council going to explore amending by-laws in this regard, or has it already done so, to try to discourage or persuade people not to use these products?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	They are then registered with the Department as a matter of course.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is with a cohort who are compliant and who want to be compliant. The by-laws coming in could apply to the cohort who are not.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is a fight we will stay out of. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No, I have asked the questions I wanted to ask.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If there are any other elements that our guests think could contribute to that report, they might engage with the committee. We certainly would welcome any feedback they encounter in the interim. It is important for all of us.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is a good idea. The high growth is in the summer months so if we are going to see it in all its glory, that is an option. Perhaps with some of the councils that have responded to the clerk we might see if there is a willingness to highlight a particular area or programme they are doing or an initiative they are taking.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have no problem with that course of action. It is only right. It is to be hoped that more than two thirds of the local authorities will have responded by the next meeting. As regards the ones who have not, it would only be right for us to examine that at our next public session to see which ones have not responded.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That petition could have come from my household, by all accounts. The recommendation is a good course of action.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree with Senator Murphy's proposal. He has raised it before and it is good that he raised it again. The breadth of petitions we have just discussed shows there is an interest in and awareness of the committee. The Senator is correct that a bit of publicity for the work of the committee will bring forward other petitions.  Speaking of our role as a committee, we were sought for our experience as a committee internationally for other parliaments looking at setting up similar petitions committees. Covid got in the way of that but maybe we can look at that in our next meeting. If I recall correctly, one correspondent stated their exploration of their committee was in its infancy and, given the length of time the Oireachtas has had a petitions committee, there was interest in us sharing our experience. Members like Senators Murphy and Buttimer and Deputy Buckley had time on the previous committee. That is invaluable for other parliaments across the world to learn from best practice. I commend the work of the clerk and staff here. It is not easy, given the volume of correspondence we have received and that they also have to try to liaise with various Departments and organisations. That is much appreciated by us and by the petitioners. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If our petition on no school on Fridays takes off, we will be a very popular committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There will be a new cohort engaging with the committee. We will have one day of school in the country left, maybe.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This is an extended meeting, is it not?
