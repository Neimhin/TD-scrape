CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand that more than 1,000 community and voluntary organisations have applied for funding under the Government's €35 million Covid-19 stability fund. Can the Minister provide an update on this very important scheme?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for her answer. As she knows, community and voluntary sector organisations and social enterprises throughout the country have been hit very hard by the Covid-19 crisis. Nevertheless, many of them have been at the coalface of the response to the pandemic, whether through the Community Call or other initiatives. I acknowledge, as I am sure does everybody in the House, their efforts over the past nine months. The Government's Covid-19 stability fund has provided significant assistance, as the Minister said, to more than 560 organisations impacted by the pandemic. I acknowledge, in particular, the allocation of €2 million for disability services in Dublin, which was targeted at services for people most at risk. It is critically important that we help these organisations with their short-term cash flow and it is good to know that funding is being prioritised for that purpose. I understand that a total of €30 million was allocated in four tranches since June. Can the Minister provide more details on the additional allocation of €10 million? If she does not have the information to hand, she might pass it on to me later. The organisations we are talking about really need to know where they stand in order to make plans for 2021 and beyond.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for her clarification. It is very welcome, particularly in respect of the €5 million that was not spent. There were questions around that. The additional €10 million announced in budget 2021 is important to the organisations looking to access it. Their future is uncertain, particularly in the event of another wave of Covid infections and if a vaccine is not forthcoming. As I said, it is very important that we provide them with information as soon as we can in order to assist them as they plan for 2021.
