CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses and the committee members for this slot. I will probably have another opportunity to talk to the EPA at the climate action committee about the new legislation on packaging, etc. However, today, I would like to raise a few issues, the first of which relates to noise and noise complaints. This is a frequent issue that constituents raise with us as public representatives. I wonder about the EPA's interaction with local authorities about the level - no pun intended - of noise complaints. Have they increased substantially over the last number of years? How does that fit in? Senator Garvey spoke about inland waterways, water pollution in general, foul water discharge and misconnections. In an urban area such as DÃºn Laoghaire, there is a large number of misconnections in small waterways. The witnesses might not have the information today, but they might correspond with the committee on the percentage of misconnections in urban areas, as it is an issue. Dr. Minihan mentioned Irish Water and its plans. Sea or bathing water quality is an important issue. As the EPA knows, Irish Water has plans to try to deal with some of the treatment plans. The water quality in Dublin Bay at times is not sufficient. I wonder how the EPA can work with Irish Water on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Byrne mentioned Irish Water. I have a question about what happens when water quality is not sufficient and there is a "water off" notice. There was a recent experience in Blackrock where an area had no water for 12 days. I appreciate that this is more in the domain of Irish Water. However, I do not understand and am not happy that after 12 days residents were told that water was safe to drink again, but no explanation was given to them. From the EPA's perspective, surely that is not sufficient.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is correct, but the communication following the initial notice was poor. I would expect that the EPA would communicate to Irish Water that a follow-up to those consumers is vital to reassure them. Irish Water should also inform them of exactly what happened.
