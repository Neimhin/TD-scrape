CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have a colleague present who will probably take five minutes. I do not mind. If it is helpful we could take five each.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses very much for their attendance this morning and for their opening remarks. I also praise the work of the unions in engaging with the Department over recent months. It has been challenging for everybody involved. More importantly, I thank the principals, deputy principals, boards of management and staff. I have been in contact with many and they have been moving furniture, measuring rooms and doing all sorts of other things in advance of the reopening of schools in recent days, which is exceptionally welcome. With regard to engagement by the unions with the Department since July in respect of the reopening of schools, how much engagement over how many days has each of those present today had with the Department to date? I do not mind who goes first.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Boyle for that reply. He mentioned in his opening remarks that no new school self-evaluation would take place for 2021. Will he elaborate on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Boyle for the clarification.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses, some of whom are returning witnesses. I appreciate their opening remarks and their comments. I also thank their organisations for their work over recent months. They have worked exceptionally hard and with the various school bodies to ensure the safe reopening of our schools, which is greatly appreciated.All of us in this Chamber and elsewhere have received calls from parents who found it exceptionally difficult to manage the blended learning and some who had no access to learning in the intervening period. The witnesses' work and that of their various organisations is greatly appreciated. I have read Inclusion Ireland's survey and it is welcome. From the queries I have received to date in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire, parents have either had blended learning at home and found it challenging or they have not been able to employ it. They are nervous that post Covid, things might not return to normal and I would welcome the witnesses' views on that. The witnesses might also elaborate on the home tuition scheme. Before that, I wish to ask two other questions. I commend Ms Lynch of the National Parents Council Primary on her organisation's extensive survey. Taking in 3,177 submissions over five days and bringing them here today is commendable. Equally-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise. The sound in here is actually quite low as well, from the last session. Did Inclusion Ireland hear my last question?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Dempsey. Our time is limited and I would be happy to engage with her again on those aspects. Turning to Ms. Lynch, as I said, the National Parents Council Primary's extensive survey of 3,177 respondents over five days is to commended. From my own knowledge, in the case of some of the schools in my own constituency and our own school as well, videos and text messages were very helpful and Ms Lynch referred to this in her own remarks. This was particularly so for the junior classes, to ease them into primary school but also for those who are returning to schools with newly-implemented Covid compliance.Ms Fanning touched on the issue of mental health and well-being at post-primary level in her opening remarks. I have raised the issue of student support teams before. Will Ms Fanning comment on those, their importance and their role in the Covid environment? I thank all the witnesses very much for their attendance.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the Minister, Deputy Foley, to the committee. I thank her for all the work she has done since taking up her portfolio, together with her officials and the various stakeholders. I know it has been challenging, in particular in recent months. I hope that as we see the schools reopen in a safe environment, we will see the fruits of that work. Earlier today we had sessions with several unions – the TUI, the ASTI, the INTO and Fórsa. I praised the work of principals, deputy principals and the school staff, in particular during the month of August, in getting schools prepared and ready for reopening. The Minister mentioned the €375 million that was available for that purpose to most schools. I will come back with some questions on that but praise must be given to those staff because of the tremendous effort that has been put in by all involved in schools. Later, we heard from Inclusion Ireland and the National Parents Council Primary and the National Parents Council Post Primary about their needs and challenges. If I have time, I will put the questions to the Minister that came up in those earlier sessions. I also commend the work of the Minister and her officials on their drive and ambition in getting the schools reopened. When we last met the Minister in this committee in June, there was scepticism on whether schools would reopen in time in September and she has achieved that, so I commend her on it. That is not to say there are not challenges. We know there will be challenges going forward. The scale of the challenges facing the education sector should not be underestimated. The Minister touched on some of those in earlier contributions about the leaving certificate and, in particular, the calculated grades. Information for parents and students is essential. The information that was released some weeks ago was very welcome. Some schools, including in my constituency, did excellent information videos, targeted mainly at junior infants, those who did not get an opportunity to have their first day in the classroom with their parents. They targeted that and they did it very successfully and I commend them on that. I have a number of questions and the Minister may not have time to answer them. I think there is an issue with the sound which I hope will be addressed when the committee next meets. It seems to be between the committee room and here. If the Minister does not have time to answer all the questions she might please come back to me. Similar to the previous question about Deputies being contacted by teachers, especially with concerns about their own health and that of the students in their care, what is the process that they must undergo if they are displaying symptoms? What supports are in place for them, including the provision of substitute teachers? That is a big issue. The second question I have touches on the contributions from the unions in an earlier session today. A school had a lack of warm water. Surely the €375 million that was available could be used for that kind of thing, because a school is not Covid-ready without warm water. I ask the Minister to comment on that. I do not have the details of where the school is but that is immaterial. The Minister is aware that I have raised mental health and well-being in schools in particular at post-primary level as a real issue, especially in the face of Covid. Could the Minister elaborate on what supports are available, in particular in terms of the student support service and the National Educational Psychological Service?I ask the Minister to please answer those questions. She is very welcome before the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Minister might come back to me directly.
