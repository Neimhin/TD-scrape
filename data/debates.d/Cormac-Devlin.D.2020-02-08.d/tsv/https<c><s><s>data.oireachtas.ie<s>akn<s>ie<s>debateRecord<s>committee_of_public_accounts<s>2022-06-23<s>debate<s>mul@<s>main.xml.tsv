CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chair. I welcome Mr. Doyle and his colleagues. It is good to have them before the committee. I will begin by referring to the issue around NOAC, as well as the local authority audit committees and the LGAS. Specifically, what is the difference between the LGAS and NOAC? Do their processes run in parallel to each other? How do they interact with the Department, for example?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have a few questions specifically on Ms Quinn's area of expertise. It was said that the National Oversight and Audit Commission hosts oral hearings from time to time. I appreciate that is an outside body but could the witnesses furnish the committee with information on that? If not today they might be able to send a note afterwards. How many oral hearings did the commission hold in 2021?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Quinn. How does a scrutiny meeting differ from an oral hearing?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I had a look at some of the reports on the website which, in fairness, is laid out very well. Some of the issues, as Mr. Doyle has said, highlight governance or compliance issues. Looking at some of the council reports and the audits of the Local Government Audit Service, some of the issues in local authorities are recurring year on year. Some relate to compliance in tendering and so on and some are internal issues. How does the Department interact and engage with those local authorities on those specific issues? Am I right in saying there is a specific section within the Department that liaises with the local authorities on audits?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would take exception to that. With a number of those reports, particularly around tendering, nothing needs to be unwound; it needs to be implemented. We are talking about a sizeable amount of public money. What is being done, either by the Department or by the audit section, as part of a carrot-and-stick approach to ensure local authorities comply on issues that are clearly being repeated year after year? The problems my not specifically relate to the same contracts but there is a lack of compliance in the organisation. What can be done about that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	These are quite specific.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What does that entail?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If a local authority were non-compliant year on year, say to the tune of â‚¬1 million, could the Department withhold funding from the Local Government Fund? Is that option open to the Department to try to instil the seriousness of non-compliance in local authorities?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Has that been done?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask the witnesses to take a look at that issue. Considering Mr. Doyle's recent conversation with the local government auditor and audit section of his Department, he might look at that for the next time we discuss this issue. I would like to ask Ms Quinn about the Public Appointments Service process. There are a lot of vacant positions, as the witnesses will be more than aware, across the local government sector. I have heard reports that it is taking months to fill those positions but that is not because of a lack of applicants. The applicants and panels are there. It is all taking too long to deliver. What can be done in that regard? On the local property tax, do the witnesses have figures for the number of deferrals being availed of across the country? If not, I ask them to send them on. I would like to know the percentages and numbers of people availing of a deferral of the payment of their property tax. Since new homes from 2013 to today are now liable, maybe they could include those figures as well.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It needs to be quicker. Where there is an applicant and a process, it is taking far too long.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms O'Donoghue.
