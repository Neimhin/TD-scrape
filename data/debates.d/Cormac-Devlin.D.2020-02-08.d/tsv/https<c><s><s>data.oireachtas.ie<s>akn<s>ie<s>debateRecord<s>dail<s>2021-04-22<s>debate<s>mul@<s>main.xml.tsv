CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the Minister and Minister of State and am grateful for the opportunity to examine the Covid-19 vaccine roll out. At the outset I want to place on record my own appreciation to the doctors, nurses, members of the Defence Forces, vaccinators and others involved in the critical effort to bring our nation out of this pandemic. News that more than 1.25 million vaccines have been administered is extremely welcome. We have seen the positive impact of the vaccination programme on our nursing homes and hospitals and internationally in countries like Israel, the UK and the USA. The vaccination programme combined with other public health measures will bring us out of this dreadful pandemic and allows us to return to normality during the summer. The programme has generally been successful but there are challenges. Like other Deputies, I have also been contacted by people over 70 who are housebound. The National Ambulance Service has done a fantastic job in administering vaccines to approximately 1,700 people in their own homes but I understand that around 300 people are still awaiting their first jab. It is critical that good communication is maintained with those people and their families so they can be reassured that they have not been left behind. Many people in the high risk and very high risk categories have also been in touch with me. Some GPs are not dealing with this cohort at all and in such cases, arrangements should be made for them to register with their local HSE area office. Finally, I understand that a number of genuine, front-line workers in category 2(g), who were registered through the portal may have been left behind. I hope that is not the case but will forward the details to the Minister's office.  Will the Minister investigate the possibility of including other vaccines approved by the EMA, the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the list of accepted vaccines for people entering Ireland?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to acknowledge the unprecedented support the Government has provided to support businesses and maintain jobs throughout this pandemic. I welcome the Minister’s commitment that there will be no cliff edge to these supports and that Government support for businesses and jobs will continue well into the year. As he will be aware, some industries will need additional support to restart as Ireland fully reopens. I recently held an online meeting with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Troy, mainly focused on the hospitality sector in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The message from that sector was straightforward; they welcomed the supports given to businesses by Government during the pandemic but they also called for certainty around the timeline for reopening and asked for key supports such as the reduced VAT rate and the commercial rates waiver to be continued until they get back on their feet. Larger hospitality businesses in particular, such as hotels, need adequate notice to prepare their premises, buy stock and rehire staff. They have also asked for flexibility with supports such as the PUP so that staff can return on a phased basis. I ask that the Minister has regard to these points as the Government finalises plans to reopen the economy. On the credit guarantee scheme, I understand €2 billion has been made available to Irish businesses. Can the Minister advise the level of uptake of this scheme? Can he also provide an update on the uptake of the enterprise support grant scheme, which provides a once-off grant of €1,000 to self-employed people? I join other Deputies in urging him to work with colleagues to introduce fast-track business insolvency arrangements to support entrepreneurs who need to wind up businesses that are no longer viable and allow them a fresh start. As we have seen with other downturns, both here and abroad, supporting efficient structural adjustment of non-performing sectors ultimately aids entrepreneurs and the wider economy to rebound.
