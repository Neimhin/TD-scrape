CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their opening statement. First, I wish Mr. Burgess well in his next endeavours. Starting with the positive, I pay tribute to him and his staff for the wonderful information they disseminate on social media. Mr. Burgess leads from the top in that regard. He is very active on Twitter and that applies across the various missions across the globe. I congratulate him on the work he has done. I also pay tribute to the staff in the various diplomatic missions across the world for their support to Irish citizens in the face of the pandemic. From early 2020 all of us parliamentarians were engaging with the Department and the work it did and support it gave to citizens in need of sometimes just simple information, but also with regard to repatriation. On that point, does Mr. Burgess have a number? He may have said it in the opening statement and I did not catch it. Does he have the number of people the Department assisted in terms of repatriation from early 2020 and the cost associated with that? That is my first question.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Burgess for that information. He mentioned the Peruvian repatriation. Constituents of mine needed to avail of that and it was quite complex owing to the location in which they found themselves. The support and information available to them and the assistance given to them on the ground were exemplary. I want to put that on the record. On the passport service, I note what Ms Jones said about the volume of renewals and new passport applications. We are all being contacted by constituents at this time. The online service is working excellently. The point was correctly made that people need to provide correct information in order for a passport to be issued. However, there are some anomalies in that regard and where these are brought to the Department's attention, they are generally dealt with very quickly. I thank the Department for that. Is there a figure for the number of renewals expected before the year end? A large number of people have not looked at their passport because they are not planning to travel abroad.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have three brief questions. I heard Mr. Burgess say that there were 259 families impacted or requiring repatriation due to citizens who had died abroad. I know this is a sensitive issue for those impacted. I am also aware of the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust, KBRT, which I am sure the Department is as it works closely with it. Are there any plans on behalf of the Department to re-examine the support for families that have been impacted by bereavement abroad and that require that service? If the witnesses do not have time to come back on my second question they might send me a note on it. On expanding the Irish footprint abroad with our diplomatic missions, I understand the witnesses said that missions in Morocco and Philippines will be opening in 2022. My understanding was that would take place in 2020 and a further 13 missions were anticipated to be open by 2025. On our diplomatic missions, particularly in the more challenging areas and regions, Deputy Sherlock referred earlier to physical security reviews for both the diplomatic missions themselves and our staff. How often are they conducted? I note that there was a saving of â‚¬897,000 in that arena in 2019. While that is welcome and I compliment the Department on making savings, it is important that we spend wisely and that we ensure we have the best and most robust security system.
