CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for being here and answering questions. I express my sympathies once again to the 1,709 families who have lost loved ones since the Covid pandemic began. I also recognise the more than 25,000 people who have contracted the virus in the Republic thus far. I want to put on record my appreciation of the front-line workers for the care and skill they have shown and assistance they have given to people throughout this pandemic. I also want to put on record my appreciation for the cleansing, catering and retail staff for their efforts throughout. Special mention should go to the transport companies that have kept things moving across the island throughout the crisis. I have previously raised the following issue with the Minister and seek clarity on it. I know the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, is meeting tomorrow and there will be further discussions about the reopening and lifting of restrictions but there are still many questions for many sectors of the economy, businesses and individuals. There are only eight working days left until the reopening and lifting of restrictions on 29 June. People are still unsure about the permitted sizes of family gatherings and weddings and whether they should be indoors or outdoors. We have heard today that about the potential lifting of restrictions for public houses as social distancing requirements fall from 2 m to 1 m. I believe the guidelines that were issued have recently been rescinded. There are only eight working days left in which to give clarity to businesses. That clarity needs to be given and, hopefully, today. We have discussed the reopening of hairdressers many times in this Chamber but it is necessary. I believe the date of 29 June was given for that reopening and the Minister might clarify that. There is also the issue of drive-in cinemas. There are ambiguities in the legislation for something as bespoke and unique as drive-in cinemas. We need clarity about that. I turn to consider St. Augustine's school in Blackrock in my constituency. The Minister is familiar with this special school because he has dealt with it over the past number of years. I understand there is a lack of funding for St. John of God, the organisation that runs the school, and that four clinical staff - two psychologists, a speech and language therapist and a social worker - may have to be redeployed. I ask the Minister to give clarity on that either in the House today or in correspondence. The latest correspondence I received from the Minister on this matter contained reassurances that the HSE would ensure that a review would take place as soon as possible. That was in 2017. The correspondence stated that, until the review is complete, the HSE would not permit any reductions or other changes in services at St. Augustine's. That issue has arisen again. Parents are understandably wary and need clarity on that matter.
