CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Reid and the other witnesses for their attendance. I welcome the community first approach in the winter plan that was announced recently.In terms of the winter plan, what reassurances can the witnesses give the committee and the public of the continuation of care, surgery and outpatient services during the winter months if there is a further spike in Covid cases?  My next question relates to my constituency of DÃºn Laoghaire. Given the number of elderly people who live in the community, I ask Ms O'Connor to elaborate on what Mr. Reid referred to in his opening remarks as "home support and enhanced home support packages".

CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms O'Connor. Mr. Reid mentioned a flu vaccine for two to 12-year olds. I ask him to elaborate on that as it is of interest in particular to parents and school-going children. Wonderful work has been done by Mr. Reid's staff and other staff as well on testing and tracing but several people in my constituency have reported that they have been dispatched to test centres in Wicklow, Tallaght or St. Vincent's Hospital as their local testing centres. I concur with other members that that is just not feasible for some people. Why is a testing centre not more readily available in the southeastern area of Dublin? Finally, it will be mental health week shortly. Given the impact that Covid is having on people who experience issues with their mental health, what additional services have been put in place as part of the winter plan?
