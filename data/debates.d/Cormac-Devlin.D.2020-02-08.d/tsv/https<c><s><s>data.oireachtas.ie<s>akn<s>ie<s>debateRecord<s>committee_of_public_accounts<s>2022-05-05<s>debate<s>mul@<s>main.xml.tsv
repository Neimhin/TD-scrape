CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Hogan and guests. I have a number of items that I want to touch on. As the previous speaker said, there is much to touch on within the Department. There are six specific items I want to ask about, namely, the NTMA; the EU budget; Irish Water; the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme; the Apple escrow fund; and legal costs - just to forewarn the Department officials. I will turn to the NTMA first and the long-term issuances in 2020 totalling €26 billion. I am just wondering about the overall cost of the €26 billion borrowed by the NTMA in 2020. Can the Department officials give me an outline on that? What is the current average interest rate of the NTMA borrowing? What oversight does the Department actually have on the primary dealers that currently have authority to issue Irish Government bonds? I will leave those questions to be answered now and then we will turn to Irish Water next.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the primary bond dealers, what is the oversight and how many are there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Directly. Okay. I am conscious of time and I have five minutes left. On Irish Water, the establishment cost was approximately €180 million in 2013.I note that in June 2020, amounts totalling €372 million were issued from the Central Fund to Irish Water under a loan agreement. What are the terms of that agreement and how much has Irish Water cost the Exchequer to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What were the terms of that funding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That was really the point of the question. I turn now to the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme. On the face of it, that scheme was extremely well received and it was really important to businesses. I understand the terms of the scheme included a maximum provision of up to €2 billion. What is the current value of loans drawn down under the scheme? How many applicants are estimated to have applied and how many received funding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	A total of 8,000 companies drew down loans. Does Mr. Hogan have an idea of how many applied?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Turning to the Apple escrow fund, the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined a number of elements of this in his opening remarks, as did Mr. Hogan. What is the up-to-date position regarding the fund at the end of March 2022?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would there be an impact on the State if the fund continues to lose value?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As I have only one minute left, I will not get to the EU budget. On legal costs, I note that costs of €439,000 were awarded and the Department's legal costs, at €510,000, were greater than that. There were two settlements paid out in 2019 totalling €24 million. I recently put in a parliamentary question about all the various State Claims Agency amounts between 2016 and 2021. I understood the Department had claims amounting to €134 million during that period. Am I right in saying there were five in 2020?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The State Claims Agency gave a total of €134 million for the period 2016 to 2021. Regarding the Department's own legal costs, I note there were awards of €439,000 and the legal costs amounted to €510,000.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Did that claim relate to this one single case?
