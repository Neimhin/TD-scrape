CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Cathaoirleach and our witnesses for the presentation and Mr. Doyle, in particular, for his opening remarks. I welcome him to the Department and to the Committee of Public Accounts. Today is a great introduction for him. I will start by sincerely thanking all of the staff of local authorities and, in particular, direct labour for their great assistance during this pandemic. Mr. Doyle’s opening remarks alluded to it but from the Community Call all the way through to the library services and the outreach services, local authorities were to the fore and acted in an exemplary manner. I pass on my appreciation and that of my party to everyone concerned. The opening remarks of the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the €3.9 billion expenditure of our witnesses' Department. Am I correct in saying €2.5 billion of this was spent on housing? My initial questions are on housing, and I have a number of them. I think I heard Ms Hurley mention that in 2019 there were 20,809 homes in pre-development stage, or it may have been Ms Ryan who said that earlier on. As to those nearly 21,000 homes at pre-development stage, under what kind of schemes are those homes being developed under? Can I get a snapshot of those, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the make up of those units. I am sorry Ms Ryan for interrupting but I am limited in time. Can she forward a copy of that report to the committee? It would be much appreciated. As to the make up of those units, are they direct builds, Part 8s, or capital assistance scheme, CAS, types?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of the 14,000 units, which is nearly half coming through local authority building, which is an important point to make-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine, I understand. The housing adaption funding is essential. I represent Dún Laoghaire which has an older population. A large proportion of our tenants require adaptions to the housing. I am conscious of the time so can Ms Ryan come back to me on the funding that is proposed for 2021 for local authorities under that heading? CAS, historically, has been slow in advancing projects but what is the bulk of funding that is going to CAS for 2021?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask that the Department might come back to me on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was said that the Local Government Fund was €473 million for 2019, according to the accounts. That is down on the 2018 figure. Perhaps Mr. Doyle might provide us with an explanation on that figure because we might have expected a bounce on that. This not necessarily question for the Department, but the local authorities must have notified the Revenue Commissioners by 30 September annually of the decision of the local authority members. That is out of sync or kilter with their own budgets and is something that needs to be addressed. It was said that An Bord Pleanála collected €18.5 million. Was that in fees or was that an overall figure? As to local authority fines that are issued, whether for littering, rent arrears, parking or whatever, do they go to the central Exchequer, into the Department, or do these stay with the local authorities? Can the Department come back to me with these replies, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Doyle and appreciate that.
