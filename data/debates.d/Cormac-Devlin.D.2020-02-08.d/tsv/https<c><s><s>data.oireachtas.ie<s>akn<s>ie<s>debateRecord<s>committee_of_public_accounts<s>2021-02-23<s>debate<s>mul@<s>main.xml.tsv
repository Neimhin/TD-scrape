CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I confirm that I am here in Leinster House. I welcome Mr. Kavanagh and Ms Eade and thank them for their attendance. I will start with some questions on Leopardstown racetrack, which is in my constituency. I welcome the redevelopment that is taking place there and which is long overdue. It is very good that it has started. I also welcome the works under way at the Curragh. Mr. Kavanagh might not have the information I am looking for to hand, in which case he might send it to me after the meeting. I am interested in the numbers of attendees at Leopardstown in 2017, 2018 and 2019. In regard to the redevelopment taking place there, I note in the documentation we received in advance of the meeting a reference to a number of claims with the contractors. I am not asking the witnesses to get into what those claims are about but will they indicate how many there are?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Kavanagh. I note that the accounts refer to rental income, which relates, I presume, to premises, stands and whatnot. Will Mr. Kavanagh elaborate on what the rental income is for and what HRI is leasing out?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely. Turning to the 2019 accounts, I note that HRI spent €120,000 on public relations and marketing in 2018 but this figure reduced to €81,000 in 2019. What was the rationale for that reduction in spending? I would have thought it would have increased, if anything.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. We need to talk about the impact of Brexit, which will be clearer once the Covid crisis is over. Covid is the first hurdle, if I may be excused that pun. What impact is Brexit having on horse racing in Ireland since 1 January?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I presume the additional cost that is associated with that is a huge challenge for the industry and, indeed, for horse owners.
