CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As the Tánaiste will be aware, I have raised issues relating to Go-Ahead Ireland in this House on previous occasions, including the poor quality of bus service it is providing to users in Dublin and across a wider area. My office is inundated with complaints about the company from the public. It is not just routes 111, 63, 59 and 75 in my area; there is a problem with the service throughout Dublin. Yesterday, for example, the 9.05 a.m service leaving Prosperous, County Kildare was cancelled and the 10.05 a.m. bus was full, leaving five people behind. The 4.23 p.m. bus leaving UCD at Belfield was cancelled for the third day in a row, leaving students stranded. This morning, the route 270 service from Dunboyne to Blanchardstown was cancelled. When commuters asked about the next service, they were told it was also cancelled. Everyone understands there will be issues on occasion but there seem to be cancelled services by Go-Ahead Ireland every day. We were initially told the reason was the Covid crisis and then that it was due to staffing and operational issues. Last week, there was a cyberattack and, today, it might be the rain. Whatever the reason, it is not acceptable. There are too many issues and they must be resolved. Will the Tánaiste raise this with the Minister for Transport?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State and Deputy Lahart. I fully agree with his remarks. We now turn to the final Topical Issue matter of the day. I call Deputy Andrews.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I apologise. Deputy Nash should have 15 minutes to speak first.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I did call the Minister after Deputy Nash moved the Second Reading. The Minister will have 15 minutes to speak after Deputy Nash.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Not ours.
