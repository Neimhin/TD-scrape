CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Sadly, it was announced this evening that a further six people have passed away due to Covid-19, bringing the total loss of life to 2,028 people. Once again, I wish to offer my condolences to them and their families and loved ones throughout Ireland. Since the pandemic emerged here in March, we knew this winter would be a challenge. The pandemic combined with the winter flu season could have overwhelmed our health service. This was spoken about many times in the Chamber. Thankfully, that is not the case today. The public have made great sacrifices. Credit is due to the efforts of hospital staff, teachers, retail workers, transport workers and all front-line workers involved in Covid-19. They are helping to keep the trend downward. Ireland appears to be managing this second wave better than most of our EU counterparts. As we approach the end of level 5 restrictions, it is appropriate that Dáil Éireann considers the kind of Christmas we want for 2020. We were told that the objective of level 5 was to reduce the incidence of covid to a manageable level to allow us a meaningful Christmas. We all know and accept that this Christmas will be like no other. People have lost their loved ones and the threat of the virus still hangs over us. Yet, there is hope. Three vaccines have been announced. They will be distributed early in the new year. It is clear that the sacrifices made by the people during level 3 and level 5 have worked and are working. We must now move to allow some services to resume. Activities like sports are essential to support mental health and physical well-being. For many people, attending religious services is essential for spiritual well-being. Activities like meeting a friend for a coffee can be essential to emotional well-being. As we exit level 5 it is important that we relax restrictions on activities in a controlled manner. This should apply to gyms, churches, coffee shops, retail, restaurants and gastropubs. However, these businesses need certainty and the Government must confirm arrangements as soon as possible. As the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will be aware, I have previously raised my concerns for the many business sectors, including hospitality, tourism, arts and retail. Businesses should reopen based on the size of the premises. That must be considered. We must balance the risk to the public and ensure that any reopening of the economy will be done against the backdrop of best public health advice.
