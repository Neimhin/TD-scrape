CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Walsh and his colleagues. It is good to have them before us again and it is certainly timely. I will take up from what Deputy Carthy touched on regarding the 2020 expenditure of €8.3 million in legal fees. That was significantly up on the 2019 figure of €3.4 million. However, the number of cases is down 12% on the 2019 figure. What is the difference? What accounts for more expenditure yet a 12% reduction in the volume of cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Legal cases, not ordinary cases.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are they all JRs or are we dealing with other types of legal case? Is it an 80:20 split between JRs and other types of legal cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What are the exact numbers for 2019 and 2020 judicial review cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Walsh said about half the expenditure was the board's legal fees and the other half was costs awarded against it. He said cases have become more complex, but what has the board done to try to protect the taxpayer?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Walsh made that point earlier. In terms of legal costs, does the board have an in-house legal section or does it outsource that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are those legal firms tendered out-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	-----and reviewed? How often?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Turning to two other items, Mr. Walsh mentioned the inspector reports. A number of these are overturned. Despite the inspectors' views the board takes a different decision. Does Mr. Walsh have a percentage of how often that is done?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was that 2020? Was the figure the same for 2019?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the board's decisions and attendance at the board - this has cropped up in the past and we dealt with it before when you were here - what is the quorum for the board to make decisions?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the usual attendance at a board meeting?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	To me, a quorum is the minimum on which to operate. To my mind to operate on a minimum and have several meetings running concurrently would not be satisfactory given the outcome and certainly the position Mr. Walsh is in today. Is that going to be reviewed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That might be something for discussion later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In my remaining minutes I will turn to the organisational review of 2016, all 255 pages of it. It started in July 2015 and was published in 2016. I am quoting from the senior counsel's own statement that says "The Review Group was set a tight timeframe set by the Minister for carrying out its tasks. Sometimes that is the best way." Obviously only 36 of the 101 recommendations have been implemented. Why is that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Walsh know how much that report cost?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was it paid for by the Department? Does the Department have a cost of the report?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be helpful. The Plean-IT system started in 2014. Is it complete yet?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That links in with the local authorities, is that right?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What was the cost to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chair, just one final question. What was the cost of that, to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Deputy is okay, she was on a roll. I will return to Plean-IT. Mr. Walsh said earlier that it was €5.4 million of cost that has been running ongoing since 2014, yet it is still not complete. Is that correct?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What was the estimated cost of this project?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	So, we are a little over double that amount.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, as Mr. Walsh has said, it is evolving. Of that €5.4 million, how much of that amount is for the consultancy element of it and the ongoing maintenance of that particular IT system?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is about 80% of the costs-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. That explains the breakdown of it. I have another question to ask in my remaining minute. With all of the changes between the strategic housing developments, SHDs, that were brought in and the strategic infrastructure developments, SIDs, there was a requirement - of which I was critical at the time - that An Bord Pleanála was not equipped IT-wise for those changes. The interface between the public and An Bord Pleanála lacked a lot of improvement. It is good to see the changes on the website, which I have witnessed and which are important. The cost, however, is quite eye watering from my perspective. Yes, there is some consultancy in that but I ask that An Bord Pleanála would be conscious of that going into the next year. I would like a breakdown of the oral hearings. Earlier I asked about the inspectors' reports and how often these are overturned and overlooked. It seems to me that it is a shot in the dark whether or not an application goes to an oral hearing. What are the criteria for the board making a decision about an oral hearing? Is the quorum for that decision equally two or three members? I believe this would have ramifications if an oral hearing is granted.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Walsh have a number for the oral hearings granted in 2019 or 2020?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The anomaly for me is that if the inspector's report is to grant permission but there is also a need for an oral hearing, where does the quorum or the board sit on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is the first question.
