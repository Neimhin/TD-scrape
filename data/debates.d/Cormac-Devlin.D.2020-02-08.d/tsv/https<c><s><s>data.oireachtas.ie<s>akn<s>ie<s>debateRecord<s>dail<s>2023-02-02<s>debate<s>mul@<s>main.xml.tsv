CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Bill. The Minister will be aware that I raised this issue on several occasions in the past year. I welcome the introduction of the Bill, which has long been sought by gardaí and their representative associations. The Bill provides for the use of body-worn cameras by gardaí and the expanded use of ANPR technology. It also contains provisions relating to CCTV footage and the recording of phone calls. It is essential that good oversight of data protection be initiated from the outset. Body-worn cameras are widely used across the EU as an effective tool for evidence gathering in the investigation of crime. They can protect both the public and gardaí. The Bill does not deal with the usage of body-worn cameras by private security firms. The sector is eager for action in this area to provide protection for its staff and members of the public. I hope that matter will be examined in the near future. I thank An Garda for its efforts to prevent and investigate crime and antisocial behaviour. It is not an easy job and Garda members are on the front line. They place themselves at risk on our behalf every day. I am sure all parties across the House are grateful for their efforts and service. Thanks is not enough, however. As an Oireachtas, we need to provide legislation to support front-line gardaí. This Bill legislating for body cameras is such a measure. I welcome the commitment of the Government to enact this year the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will increase the maximum penalty for the offence of assault causing harm, from five years' imprisonment to ten. However, further action from the Minister is required to deal with the attacks on gardaí and first responders. Mandatory minimum sentences should be introduced. There should be no tolerance for attacks on members of An Garda Síochána, the fire brigade, the ambulance service and other first responders in our society.
