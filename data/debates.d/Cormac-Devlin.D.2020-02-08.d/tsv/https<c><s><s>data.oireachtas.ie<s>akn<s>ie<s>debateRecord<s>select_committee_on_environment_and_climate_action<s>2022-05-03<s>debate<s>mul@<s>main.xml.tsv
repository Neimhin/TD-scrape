CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 6:In page 9, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:"(c) contains more than 10 per cent plastic,".At the outset, I am pleased that the Minister of State is engaging with the amendments and is willing to accept some of them, although my first one fell at the first hurdle. Let us hope there are other opportunities for inclusion in the Bill. In terms of utilising our time, it would also be helpful to know which ones the Minister of State is going to accept if this is feasible because it will help us have a debate around the ones that are not going to be accepted about why they should be included. This amendment is self-explanatory. While I hear what the Minister of State said about my first amendment, this is similar but I do not propose to defer to the EU single-use plastic strategy on this. We must be realistic in our outlook regarding what might materialise in terms of being manufactured. We could be walking ourselves into a bigger problem down the line irrespective of what legislation comes from the EU. This is a sensible amendment and I ask the Minister of State to consider it. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Basically, I am in agreement with Deputy Bruton regarding the compilation of many of these products and the materials used. I will speak to the three amendments together. They are from the same area of the Bill on page 16, just on different lines. Ultimately, this is about stitching in a kind of a polluter pays principle. My big concern is potentially seeing manufactured products such as single-use cups that are not actually reusable in the long term or are keepable by the consumer. We are walking ourselves into a bigger problem here. We have to be cautious, particularly in respect of amendment No. 35. The Bill currently provides for a sum of not “less than €0.20 or more than €1.00”. I am a little bit dubious about whether we should be so prescriptive in primary legislation. However, that said, we should perhaps put in what is in the amendment, which is “less than €.01 or more than €1.00, which would be determined by the total percentage of plastic content within the material of the single-use item.” We have to be conscious that manufacturers may look to substitute for alternative goods, which in the long run is actually not environmentally good, and was said earlier, may have unintended consequences. I ask the Minister of State to consider those amendments, along with amendments Nos. 34 and 36.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No, but I might reintroduce it on Report Stage.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 16:"In page 10, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following: “(b) reductions in plastic single use items according to the waste hierarchy within EU Waste Directive 2008/98 and Commission Implementation Regulation (EU) 2020/2151 Single Use plastic Directive,”.I will withdraw the amendment. I might reintroduce it on Report Stage. The Chair might read out the amendments that the Minister has given, so that we know which ones have been accepted or are going to be accepted. That might help.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I do not think it would be that big, in fairness.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 34:In page 16, line 23, after “available” to insert the following:“and if the levels of material wastage of the single-use item do not adhere to the principles as outlined in EU Waste Directive 2008/98 regarding lifecycle justification and the best overall environmental outcome in regard to achieving the lowest carbon dioxide emissions and freshwater consumption”.I will return to the amendment on Report Stage.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 35:In page 16, line 32, to delete “less than €0.20 or more than €1.00” and substitute the following:“less than €0.01 or more than €1.00, which will be determined by the total percentage of plastic content within the material of the single-use item”.Likewise, I intend to return to this amendment on Report Stage.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 36:In page 16, line 32, after “€1.00” to insert the following:“and be applied on a pro-rata basis according to the total percentage of plastic content within the material of the single-use item”.I also intend to return this amendment on Report Stage.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Amendment No. 41 will change the wording from "suitable" to "recyclable", which will encourage and create what the Minister of State is hoping to do, namely, to have the circular economy fully operational. It is a matter of wording. Similarly, amendment No. 42 seeks to encourage better outcomes than those that flow from the existing single-use alternatives. The Minister of State might outline what kind of engagement has happened with industry and business. While there were no amendments under the levies, there are concerns about the full implication and impact the Bill will have, on both manufacturing and disposal.There really is a need to ensure that any levies are pro rata to discourage the disposal of products that have a longer lifespan. I heard what the Minister of State said about the paper versus plastic cup, for example, but my fear is that the consequence of some elements of this Bill would be that products would be advertised as reusable but their flimsiness would be such that they would not actually be reused or retained by the customer but would be discarded. That is not something that I, the Minister of State, or anyone else on this committee wants to see but there is a genuine fear within the sector. The Minister of State said he would engage with café owners but many of the elements of this Bill will come as a surprise not only to business owners, but also to consumers, given the speed with which it has come to this committee. In that context, I ask the Minister of State to outline the engagement he has had with industry and business. I also ask him to respond to amendments Nos. 42 and 43. Separately, I cannot find the list of amendments that the Minister of State proposes to accept. Is it available on Microsoft Teams? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 41:In page 21, line 3, after “suitable” where it firstly occurs to insert “recyclable”.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 42:In page 21, line 4, after “wastage” to insert the following:“that provides a better environmental outcome demonstrated through life-cycle thinking compared to the existing single-use alternative”. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for his comments on industry and businesses. While I heard his welcome remarks in respect of IBEC, Food Drink Ireland and other organisations, on the other end of the circular economy, has there been engagement with waste disposal companies? If so, how recent was that engagement? He referred to the levy going to public consultation and whatever else. As regards other charges relating to the waste industry, will a similar approach be taken with waste contractors? I refer to levies in respect of certain materials going to landfill rather than incineration, etc. Is that kind of engagement going to happen? I am looking at some of the proposed charges. Is there going to be change in the context of keeping that parity between the various waste streams?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What impact will that have on the Bill? Will there be changes to the legislation in respect of items going to landfill rather than incineration or being recycled? At the moment, there are different levels of charges for different materials. If that is going to change, will that engagement happen after the enactment of the Bill?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If they send me a note, that will be fine.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State.
