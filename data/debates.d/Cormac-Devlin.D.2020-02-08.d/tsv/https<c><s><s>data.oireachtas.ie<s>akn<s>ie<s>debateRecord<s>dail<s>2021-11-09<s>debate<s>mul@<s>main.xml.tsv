CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State and his officials for bringing forward this motion. I welcome the opportunity to examine it. I will be supporting the motion which will authorise the Minister for Finance to not allocate €500 million to the rainy day fund for 2021. The action is prudent given the very exceptional circumstances created by the Covid-19 pandemic. A similar motion under section 6 of the National Surplus Act 2019 was proposed last year in the context of the pandemic and in 2019 because of Brexit. Given the international economic environment, returns on investments are minimal and the €500 million will be better spent being invested here in Ireland. That said, the medium-term benefits of building a counter-cyclical fund remain. The macroeconomic outlook for next year is very positive and in those circumstances I would like to see the payments resume in the future. It is important we prudently set aside funds during the good times for future challenges. We have mentioned challenge of Brexit. Who was to know that something would surpass Brexit? It was the issue of the time, and remains a significant challenge for this country, but then along came the pandemic and really put us to the test. However, the Government moved quickly, and rightly so, at the outset of the pandemic to provide funds. The Minister of State said it required €48 billion to deal with the pandemic and to fund front-line Departments, local authorities and agencies to ensure the continuity of public services, protect incomes and re-imagine the public realm. The work of officials and staff at the Department of Social Protection in particular should be noted. They reacted overnight, ensuring more than half a million workers had access to pandemic unemployment payment. I also want to acknowledge the actions of Revenue in dealing with companies and all their queries about employees and themselves.The response of the Revenue Commissioners was exemplary, especially in the early and middle parts of last year, and should be acknowledged. Local authorities also moved quickly to improve the public realm, installing public toilets, bins, outdoor seating, etc., and providing all sorts of other services. I encourage local authorities to retain improvements that have worked and engage in meaningful public consultation, which is key in this regard. However, now the acute phase of the pandemic has passed - I hope it is behind us - it is important we resume normal procurement practices to ensure taxpayers' money is spent prudently. This is particularly important given the increase in costs for construction projects and services. I join the Minister of State in expressing condolences to those who passed away during the pandemic. This is not all about money. This is about the impact it has had on society, families, workers and businesses across the country. We must remember that when we are discussing finance in this House. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their attendance today and for their assistance over the past 20 months.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask the Minister for Finance to outline the ways in which the Government is supporting the credit union sector to continue to provide essential financial services to local communities.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for that reply and for his engagement, particularly on the review. I note that €1.1 billion being lent for SMEs and mortgages. Will he please update the House on the three commitments contained within the programme for Government, one of which is the status of the review with the policy framework with the credit unions and how they are operating? What action is being taken to enable and support the credit union movement to grow? I also note the 18% increase in the loan book. How are he and his Department supporting credit unions in expanding their services to encourage community development? Finally, I ask the Minister of State to provide an update on these commitments, either to the House this evening or in written form.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Minister of State mentioned the credit unions’ willingness to step in, particularly given the closure of bank branches throughout the country. There have been a number of high-profile branch closures, including in my constituency and in Dublin city. Only last week, Shankill in my constituency lost its ATM. Some Deputies might say that that is not the end of the world. However, it is for a community that relies on that ATM to access services. I also commend Core Credit Union for its proactive nature in expanding its services. That is exactly what the credit unions want to do. They want to expand services, such as loans, savings, current accounts, debit cards, apps, online banking and so on. With the right support from Government and from the Central Bank of Ireland, credit unions say that they can continue to be present in towns and villages, which is important. I acknowledge what the Minister of State is saying about that. The Minister of State might please keep in contact with me about that engagement, to ensure that once the review is complete we know exactly where we are.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On behalf of Deputy Crowe, I ask the Minister for Finance his plans to enhance the NCID, in relation to insurance.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is welcome news. I welcome the proposed extension of the national claims information database. I note that last week, at an Oireachtas committee, Oliver Gilvarry, head of the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council secretariat made the point that enhancements to the NCID database would provide greater detail on claims which would help to drill down on the cost of the awards. I note what the Minister of State has said about the volume of information available here compared with other jurisdictions, especially the breakdown between awards and legal costs. We have seen with the database that the more information that comes through, the more information policy makers have to move forward and identify what changes need to be made. Is it the intention to make sure that more data are provided?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State. It is certainly good information for consumers. The first Central Bank report on the national claims information database was published more than a year ago. It identified that in reality, the award to the individual, whether through PIAB or the courts, was pretty much the same. Coming back to the database, that is why, according to the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, it is so important to see the information flow so that the industry can be challenged about why prices are not falling. When can we expect to see the changes take effect? What impact does the Minister of State anticipate it will have on the cost of insurance overall?
