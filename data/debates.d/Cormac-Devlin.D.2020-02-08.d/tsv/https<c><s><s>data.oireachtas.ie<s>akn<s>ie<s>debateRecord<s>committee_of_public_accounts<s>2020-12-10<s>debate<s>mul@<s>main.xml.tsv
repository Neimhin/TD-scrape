CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses. Are the visiting committees still operational?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How often do they visit the prisons?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Why is it the case that the last report I could find from the Irish Prison Service was from 2014? Are there not more up-to-date reports?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Why is there such a backlog of reports?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The last one I found was from 2014 and it would have been helpful today to have those. I would like the witnesses to revert on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	They may be published but they are not on the Irish Prison Service website. The two organisations might revert on that. I thank the witnesses for that. Figures were given for the number of prisoners currently in custody, which is 3,971, and it was also mentioned that there were 8,939 committals. How many prisoners are on remand versus committed by the courts?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Basically, on those figures, what is the number of prisoners who are typically in a cell?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witness for the figures. How many cells, in percentage terms, are overcrowded?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It would not be classified as overcrowded.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are the three-person cells overcrowded according to international standards?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his report. Chapter 7.11 relates to catering, indicating â‚¬5.66 as the average cost of a meal in 2009. Depending on age and gender, I presume, there are considerations of the volume of food needed. It specifically states that in the Portlaoise prisons, some prisoners have extra menu options available by long-standing arrangement, including historical and political reasons. Why does this apply to only some prisoners and those in Portlaoise? Why are the extra options not available to the rest of the cohort?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would the mess committee cover the E block in Portlaoise?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. Is it purely because these prisoners are accommodated in the E block and the reason they are being detained that these prisoners get extra options?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In other prisons, including Mountjoy, are there any additional options for prisoners? What I am trying to decipher is whether a prisoner is better off being accommodated in some prisons? Ideally, a person would not need to be accommodated in any prison but would a prisoner be better off in terms of catering facilities in some prisons? Are some prisoners treated better than others?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I get that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What about the menu?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. Perhaps the Irish Prison Service will update us on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Could the relevant authority, maybe the Irish Prison Service, revert to me with the method by which the prisoner welfare accounts are distributed. I understand there was a reference to the governor. The witnesses might revert to us on that, the sums of money involved and the number of complaints received. I will examine again the information on prison committees. I am aware that 2014 was the starting year but I am looking for the number of complaints received in 2019. That would be appreciated. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Hardship payments, yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms McCaffrey.
