CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Good morning to Mr. Reid and his colleagues. It is good to have them before the committee again. I thank them for the information provided to date. I will start with Mr. Mulvany on the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening remarks concerning the annual report, which discloses an unaudited figure of more than €1 billion of current expenditure. This was spoken about earlier but I was not here at that stage. The Comptroller and Auditor General stated: [T]he appropriation account for the Vote does not report the out-turn for the mental health services, either in terms of delivery performance or of service-related expenditure. Reconciling the budget figures for mental health funding to the HSE's annual report spending figure for mental health is further complicated because of the different bases of accounting used. The framework of accountability for ... expenditure on our health services is therefore very complex.Is there a way to streamline that for next year so the committee can get a better picture of the expenditure broken down by section under the mental health heading?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am aware the HSE publishes that but I wonder if there is a way to streamline the process so that the committee does not encounter this problem again when it receives the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the operation and running of the HSE. Effectively, it says there are two different systems at work. The HSE is accountable to the Department and, ultimately, the Minister and that track is in place; however, as an oversight committee of public bodies, we need to be able to distil down the information, as we do for all public organisations. Is there a way to make sure the systems talk to each other? Will that happen in the next 12 months? Is that part of the plan for the HSE?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am familiar with that because we have spoken about it before. I am conscious of my time. I turn to the CAMHS issue. Ms O'Connor is welcome back to the committee. I heard what she said about Kerry CAMHS to the effect that it is specific to that area. I do not want to dwell too much on it because it is an active, ongoing case. However, it would be remiss of us not to touch on it while we are talking about CAMHS in general. I will only touch on items that are in the public domain. I understand from what Ms O'Connor is saying that there will be learnings from the Maskey report. How sure is Ms O'Connor and the HSE that it is specific to that area?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Internal oversight is obviously crucial as well. That is where the structures of the national office and the national lead - and I know that Ms O’Neill is on the call and can deal with this as well - are essential. Irrespective of the professional bodies that individuals may belong to, internal structures obviously failed here. They failed significantly over a number of years. I have met with some of the parents in regard to the Kerry CAMHS. To say that it is distressing is an understatement. It is very upsetting as a parent to hear of the issues that they have faced over several years in respect of so many different failings. To me, Dr. Sharma has done the people of Kerry and, indeed, the people of the country a great service. I commend him on his work because, without it, this issue would have rumbled on I fear. I take what Ms O'Connor is saying that it is isolated to that area. I hope that is the case, but I ask Mr. Reid to ensure that there is a full audit across the country, as the Minister has requested, in order to make sure it is just an isolated incident. What services and supports have been offered to the families, parents and, ultimately, children in Kerry since this issue entered the public domain? My information is that not much has changed, even with everything else that we now know. I hope that is incorrect and that it is not the case. If it is the case, I hope that the matter will be rectified as of close of business today because the families feel that there is a great deal of discussion going on in the public domain but that there is not a great deal of change within the HSE.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Audit aside, what supports and services are being put in place today for those families?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the clinical support team issue, I am glad Ms O’Connor raised that point and I am running out of time but I ask the Chairman for indulgence on this point. My understanding is that prescriptions have not been reviewed and that the clinical support team needed to be in place certainly prior to our guests' appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts. I ask that resources be deployed through the national office, from elsewhere if necessary, in order to ensure that the families are engaged with at the very least today or by the end of the week. I cannot fathom that if my child had been impacted since 2016, nobody would have made contact with me as of today to say that everything was going to be reviewed and supports offered. It is not just the children any more but it is their entire family who need the supports and services. I am not asking Ms O’Connor to comment on that but I am asking Mr. Reid, through all of the staff that he has available and are at his disposal, to ensure that there is a targeted approach to the families who have been impacted since, arguably, before 2016, but certainly since 2016 up to today, where we need to ensure that they get the services. I will leave it at that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will take up where I left off at the last round on the clinical support team. Ms O'Connor was discussing the supports that would be put in place for the families and children in Kerry CAMHS. She might send us a note on the updates when she replies to the committee. On overall mental health services, we recall the terrible attack on the HSE and Department IT services. Can we get an update on that? Mr. Reid said that approximately 80% of the HSE's services were impacted. What level of services have been restored? Are they fully back? Has the system been updated? Is the HSE satisfied with the security arrangements that are now in place?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is in the public domain that over the past couple of years there was old operating software on laptops. Has that all been replaced or are people within the HSE still operating on older systems?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Reid for that update. In the minute or so that is left to me, of the 73 CAMHS, I have three in the Dún Laoghaire area in the CHO 6 area. Recruitment has been a perennial problem, particularly for CHO 6 and for the south-eastern part of south Dublin. I ask Mr. Reid, and he can send in a note on this, on the increase in in-patient public beds and, indeed, the increase in private, in-patient beds for CAMHS and for mental services overall. I ask not just across the country, but specifically about CHO 6. I raised the issue of respite yesterday in the Dáil. In CHO 6, a respite house has been allocated to an individual after legal proceedings. That has left 88 individuals who rely on that property for respite in the lurch. That will take some time to replace. I would ask Mr. Reid and the relevant officials within the HSE to work with St. John of Gods to try to get a replacement, and other properties as soon as possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	And mental services
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
