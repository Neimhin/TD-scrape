CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their attendance. I will return to an issue my colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, raised. I refer to HAP and homeless HAP in particular. Some applicants who have been approved for HAP have had their payment reduced if they accepted a property with a particular approved housing body, AHB. In a recent incident, a single individual had been approved for the full amount and just by virtue of the AHB they were approved to be housed with, their payment was to be reduced. I do not know how that would happen. I do not expect the witnesses to know the intricacies of these issues, but is there a policy or a mechanism within the Department whereby one gets a reduced homeless HAP for certain AHBs? I would have thought it was standard right across the board.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is what I would have thought. I am flushing that out because the Comptroller and Auditor General's report delves deeply into HAP expenditure. I would like to ensure there is no differential, particularly for people who are homeless. The assistance of the State must be there to ensure they have a roof over their heads. It took quite a bit of effort to get to the bottom of this case and the anxiety caused to the individual concerned is unacceptable. I might submit further correspondence to the Department to try to deal with that issue. Deputy Verona Murphy alluded to the pyrite remediation scheme. I ask the witnesses to advise the committee on the progress made between the Housing Agency and HomeBond. I heard what the Chairman said about the previous Committee of Public Accounts and the Oireachtas committee on housing dealing with this issue. I ask the witnesses to update the committee on that work. The report makes note of the non-pyrite related damage. I am not referring to the damage identified when dealing with the pyrite issue, but properties constructed in the last decade or two, or even three, where there are general defects. What remediation policies or procedures are there for the Department to deal with those individuals?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there any timeframe on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Claimed so far or is there-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are there remediation schemes for non-pyrite properties with general defects that have come to the attention of the Department?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Has money been allocated within the Department for 2021 to deal with those properties?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That only deals with those particular ones. Is there a fund generally for properties to which Ms Neary has not alluded?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the pyrite remediation scheme, I refer to recommendation 13 on page 232 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2019: "The Board and Agency should put in place a robust process to quantify the cost of remediating non-pyrite related damage." Has that been initiated yet and what stage is that particular recommendation at?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Connor for that. On those non-pyrite related problems and with reference to what Ms Neary said in reply to my previous question, where another problem is identified with a property or properties, is an application made to the Minister or the Department under section 13 to have it included in the remediation scheme?How is that done?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The scheme covers the period 1997 to 2013. There were 31 applications made for DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown up to the end of 2019. The witnesses might come back to me on those applications. That information would be of interest to me. On the land aggregation scheme, how many sites are we talking about in total? The report refers to 47 sites that were transferred. I am sure there are more sites than that. Further on, the report states that 36 sites have gone to approval stage, that these sites comprise 159 ha, and that approximately 3,370 homes are earmarked for those sites. It also states that there are 37 sites, comprising 89 ha, that are not suitable for development. How many sites have come under that scheme, how many of them are in Dublin, and how many of them have plans approved under, say, Part 8? I am speaking in this regard not about plans in the pipeline but plans approved. Also, how many of the sites have been built on since 2010?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There were refinanced. Is that done for the purpose of the balance sheet of the local authority?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How many are in Dublin? Mr. O'Connor might come back to me on the 37 sites that are not suitable.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses.
