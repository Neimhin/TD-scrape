CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Government's cost-of-living package is very welcome, particularly the €200 household electricity credit along with the €125 lump sum to those in receipt of fuel allowance, as well as the 20% reduction in transport fares for the 19 to 23-year-olds, along with the reduction in the drug payment scheme threshold to €80. The €200 household electricity credit will be applied to more than 2.1 million homes across the State. A number of people have been in contact with me who are on prepaid meters and are seeking clarity around those arrangements for them. Will the Taoiseach raise the matter with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and request that arrangements be put in place to give prepaid customers a credit for their meter, not just to the underlying account, in order that they can get the benefit of the credit right away and not have to wait for the adjustment?
