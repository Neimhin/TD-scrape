CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for taking these questions. With just 35 days to go before the UK leaves the EU, what preparations have the Minister's Department done in advance of this?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have no doubt this has been extremely time-consuming for the Minister and officials not just in his Department but across the Government for the past number of years. That said, it is prudent for us to have the reserve that budget 2021 has given us because of the potential of a no-deal Brexit. It is the right course of action. I know the Department is making every effort to deal with the challenges of Brexit but the next few months will be extremely difficult for Ireland and businesses, not just because of Brexit but because of Covid-19 as well. Is the Minister aware of this morning's report in The Irish Times, which claims that Ireland could lose out to France in laying claim to a significant portion of the €5 billion Brexit compensation fund? Even if we got all the fund, it would not compensate the hit to our economy. As the Department of Finance and ESRI analysis indicates, the long run impact to gross domestic product is between 2.6% and 5% in a no-deal Brexit, meaning losses of between €9 and €17 billion in 2017 prices. Will the Minister comment on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister and I welcome his remarks on the diplomatic approach. It is important that Ireland avails of this fund as much as possible, considering the grave impact Brexit could have on our economy. We must avail of that compensation fund as much as possible. The Minister made remarks on the work of the Revenue Commissioners and their engagement with businesses, which I very much welcome. We can see from experience with Covid-19 support schemes that many businesses are, unfortunately, not availing of existing supports. It is important we ensure these businesses are prepared for Brexit and that they also avail of supports that are available to them. Britain has provided six months for the implementation period in their economy, with a deferral of Brexit customs declarations until 30 June 2021. Would a similar adaptation period be considered by the Minister and his departmental officials here?
