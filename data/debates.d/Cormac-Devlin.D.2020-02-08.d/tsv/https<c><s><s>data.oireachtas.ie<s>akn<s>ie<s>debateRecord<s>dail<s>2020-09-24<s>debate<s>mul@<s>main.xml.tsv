CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My question relates to the much-needed extension to the Luas green line from Bride’s Glen and Cherrywood. I note that the extension of the Luas lines to Bray, Lucan, Poolbeg and Finglas was included in the National Transport Authority’s 2016 transport strategy for Dublin, and news that the Finglas line is proceeding is welcome. However, residents in the other areas are wondering where they stand. In particular, will the Minister provide an update on the status of the extension to the Luas line from Bray?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Residents across Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and not just in the Bray area, want to see delivery on public transport improvements. I note what the Minister has said about BusConnects and DART+, which is very welcome. However, development is currently taking place in areas such as Cabinteely, Carrickmines, Cherrywood and Old Conna, to name but a few. I estimate some 50,000 people will be living and working in that area over the next few years. Development plans were agreed on the basis that public transport would be upgraded, along with the extension to the green line. There were three preferred routes back in 2006 and any delays to projects such as the Luas link to Bray or the construction of the new Woodbrook DART station, on which I have another question today, would put serious pressure on the road network. Something needs to happen.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	While I agree with the Minister's view about future development, the development plans are under way and I hope the Minister's office will contact the relevant local authorities. As I mentioned, the Cabinteely, Carrickmines, Cherrywood, Shankill and northern Bray area has enormous development already planned and, on the back of that, it is anticipated public transport will be delivered. In fact, many of the developments that have happened are on the back of the idea that public transport will be delivered in those areas. One of those projects is the Luas green line, the B2 line, which, as I said, had three options. People want a high-frequency, high-capacity link from Bride’s Glen to Bray. In addition, and as the Minister mentioned, there are key employment areas such as Sandyford, Dundrum and Cherrywood. It is critical that we have an alternative to the car, that it is a reliable service and that the capacity is there to accommodate all of those people living and working in those areas. I ask the Minister to commit that, in the national development plan, we fast-track and reconsider that extension to the Luas line.
