CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The programme for Government commits to supporting homeowners living with housing defects. I have been approached by residents of Carrickmines Green, an estate in Carrickmines owned by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.Construction at Carrickmines commenced in 2005, with many residents moving in shortly afterwards. However, the developer went under in mid 2009 and the residents were left living in a so-called ghost estate for many years until the receiver McStay Luby and NAMA began to complete the project. In 2015, there was a fire in an unfinished block. A subsequent fire safety report raised issues and recommended extensive repairs to fire-stopping materials across the estate. I understand some of these works have taken place but many remain outstanding. The issue is now urgent as residents have been advised they cannot renew their insurance. Will the TÃ¡naiste raise this matter with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, asking NAMA to engage with the residents to find a solution?
