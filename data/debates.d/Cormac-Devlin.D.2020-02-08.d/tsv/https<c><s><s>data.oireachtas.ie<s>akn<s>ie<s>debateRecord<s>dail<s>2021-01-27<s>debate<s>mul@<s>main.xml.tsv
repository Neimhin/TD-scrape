CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Government's unprecedented supports for Irish businesses, jobs and enterprise in response to the devastating pandemic and an extension to the CRSS. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Government has rightly done everything possible to support businesses, jobs and workers. The CRSS allows business affected by Covid to claim support from the Revenue Commissioners of up to €5,000 per week. I understand that almost 20,000 businesses have availed of the scheme to date. Could the Minister provide details for Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown? He might forward them in time. The recent surge in Covid cases and the extension of level 5 restrictions will be of concern to many businesses. They are worried about the future. They are not worried about today or tomorrow but about the medium-term outlook for themselves and their employees. A vaccine is being rolled out and the programme relating to it has been well debated in this House. We will eventually return to a degree of normality. It would be helpful if the Government used the next six weeks to review the economic circumstances and prepare a national restart plan. A high-level advisory board should be considered to conduct a regional and sectoral review of the economy to pinpoint where the supports are required. Consultation with stakeholders is essential. A two-tier economic recovery must be avoided. From talking to businesses in my constituency, Dún Laoghaire, I am aware that some are doing well. They are mainly international exporters but many businesses in the hospitality and tourism sector and SMEs are struggling despite the unprecedented Government supports. We are aware that Irish SMEs provide the bulk of jobs in our economy. They are worried about the future and need to be reassured that supports will continue beyond 31 March until the pandemic ends and that there will be a plan to restart our economy. These businesses will need a considerable cash-flow injection to restart. For some the future is very bleak, unfortunately, and some, even with the supports, may not survive. These entrepreneurs need support to restructure their businesses or, in some cases, to wind up. Examinership and liquidation should be reviewed to allow fast-track, low-cost wind-ups and restructuring to allow entrepreneurs a fresh start. Local enterprise offices have made considerable efforts to advise businesses but businesspeople tell me that the system needs to be simplified, be it through a one-stop shop, a telephone line or a central website of some sort. More needs to be done for the orphan companies that fall between the existing schemes. I refer to those affected in the tourism, transport, car rental and entertainment sectors. The Minister will be aware that I previously raised the issue of Tom Duffy's Circus, an Irish institution in itself, and the generations involved in the arts, culture and heritage. Such businesses are being left behind and need support. I ask the Minister to redouble his efforts to support these companies and others.
