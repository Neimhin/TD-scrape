CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their time this morning and for their input. I have a question for Mr. Carroll and will focus on two elements. He referred to the just transition in his opening remarks and there were some questions around it. From his experience does he believe it is something that should be stated explicitly in legislation or should it be referred to and then fleshed out subsequently? He might give us his thoughts on that. He made a comment a few minutes ago about the review set for 2023. I believe that is the European Green Deal but he might elaborate on that.

CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that NECP due for review here in Ireland in 2023?
