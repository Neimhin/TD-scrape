CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The issue arising in regard to any public body that the committee wishes to bring lies is one aspect. Is there a weekly meeting of committee chairpersons and, if so, could this matter be discussed at that forum as well? I note from the Ceann Comhairle's correspondence to the committee that another issue has arisen, I presume, because of Standing Order 218. It appears certain committees feel that the Committee of Public Accounts should not be inviting in certain bodies that it is within its remit or purview to interview. Have the committee chairpersons discussed this matter? I accept the proposal regarding this committee making a suggestion about Standing Orders but perhaps a representative of this committee should present to the Committee on Procedure on the issue. There seem to be a few unintended consequences arising in regard to the Standing Orders, which present serious issues for this committee going forward and we should try to tease out the matter a little more. I am conscious that correspondence is going to take a long time.
