CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Staying with the issue of survivors and their applications, I know the witnesses will not go into any individual case nor will I. I will just highlight one without identifying anybody. I note that home improvements accounted for €68.1 million of expenditure. Last summer, in respect of the staying at home, home help and tenants support scheme, I made contact with Caranua on behalf of a survivor. This individual is living in a family home that happened to be rented from the local authority. Therefore, there seemed to be a bit of an issue. I wondered about it at the time so it is opportune for me to ask how many other individuals found that difficult. It was a kitchen upgrade because the property, which I saw myself, required that but that individual found it very difficult to access what I call their funds. How was that the case? Ms Downes has stated there is a complaints mechanism and that there were two complaints this year. How many complaints have been made since 2013? One should remember that some of these people are extremely vulnerable individuals who are not used to articulating or are sometimes unable to articulate their concerns and, therefore, some of them might turn to public representatives.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am aware of that. That was not about repairs. Under the home help and tenant support scheme, an individual is able to re-carpet the house or do things a tenant is responsible for doing. I found it exceptionally difficult in this case. We were in contact through written correspondence. Eventually, it did work out. How many complaints have been received since 2013?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Downes does not have it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How many were made last year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In her opening statement, Ms Downes said that a surplus was available during 2020 and Caranua initiated a number of projects to re-engage with survivors and access their individual limit of €15,000. Last summer, I understood there was going to be a cut-off mark for that home help and tenant support scheme - probably towards the end of last year, which was correspondence I saw - but I now understand that it was extended and has been extended even further due to Covid, which is welcome. How many survivors have not engaged given the fact that 6,181 are eligible? I know there is money left over but how many people is Caranua unable to engage with? What is the process there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand. Does Ms Downes know from the list Caranua had how many survivors still-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for cutting across Ms Downes but my time is limited. Is Ms Downes saying that based on the list with which she was provided that ranged from 2013 to the present day, in theory, there are about 5,000 survivors with whom there has been no engagement?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the process for those individuals subsequent to the wind down of Caranua? What happens then?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	So it goes to the Department.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask Ms Downes to come back to me, particularly with the regard to the tenant support scheme and the number of complaints because I have concerns about individuals from whom none of us have ever heard but who have made an application for access to their €15,000. From where I am sitting, that money is theirs to spend. I accept what Ms Downes said about repairs and items for which a local authority or another landlord is responsible.Where it goes to home improvements and making their quality of life better, we should do our damnedest to ensure money gets to them and they get the benefit.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I see that but we are talking about the other element. I thank the witness.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am a new enough member of this committee but I have to say that with all the other witnesses who have come before us, when questions were asked we got detailed answers. I have not found that today. There has been a lot of the witnesses saying that they will come back to us or that they do not have information to hand, not just in response to my contribution but to those of others as well. I am a bit surprised by that because from our perspective, Caranua will be wound down from March, although that may be extended, so this is our opportunity on behalf of not only the survivors but the public to question certain elements.Nobody is casting aspersions on any individual here. We are just asking questions about how the fund was operated. On that basis - and Ms Hynes from the Department might be able to come back in on this - when is this legislation on the wind-down of Caranua anticipated to come before the Houses? Equally, because the list of correspondence that Ms Downes is going to come back to us on is getting longer and longer as the meeting goes on, I suggest that we might analyse that, Chairman, and then examine it again as a committee, certainly prior to March because we may have follow-on questions.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Hynes for that but neither question was answered. While I know the legislation will come before the Houses in the new year, does she have a specific timeframe, perhaps to the nearest month? I am conscious that Caranua probably will not exist after 24 March. I think that is the date. On the issue of the data on the website, that is great, and I can look for those data after the meeting but I was hoping somebody attending the meeting might have the data to hand. That would have been much more useful.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine if it is not available. I just thought it would be a good question to ask because it would give us as a committee a timeframe to work to. I will source the data myself.
