CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Taoiseach will be aware the programme for Government commits to dealing with asylum applications as quickly as possible to ensure people seeking international protection here do not have to endure long delays to have their cases assessed or determined. Given the significant increase in applications over the past 12 months, it is clear the Immigration Service Delivery, the International Protection Office and the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, IPAT, will need extra resources. For example, I understand that IPAT fees to barristers determining the appeals have not changed since 2011 and this may have an impact on recruiting sufficiently qualified personnel for that. Will the Taoiseach advise what measures are being taken to support these institutions which are responsible for determining these cases?
