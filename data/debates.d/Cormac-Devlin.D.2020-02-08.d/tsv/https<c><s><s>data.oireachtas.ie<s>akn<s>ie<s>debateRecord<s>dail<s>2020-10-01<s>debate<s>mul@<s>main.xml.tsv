CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for his attendance earlier today and for the time he spent at the Covid committee along with members of NPHET yesterday. We had a frank and open discussion, including suggestions from members for how we might further engage with the public. As has been said in this session and in others, we are in uncharted waters. Nobody has the right answer. We are learning as we go. It is important to listen to suggestions and take them on board. We all need to work together. I also welcome this opportunity to discuss the Government's resilience and recovery plan, the Roadmap for Living with Covid-19. I note that the national framework is built on three pillars: healthy people, strong businesses and resilient communities. I will touch on those in the time I have. With the roadmap, there is a doubling of the public health workforce and the publication of the guidance on visits to long-term residential care. The doubling of the public health workforce is critical because we need more staff there. I welcome that the recruitment is under way. On the guidance on the long-term residential care, many if not all of us have had contact from constituents who have loved ones in nursing homes. They want an easing of restrictions so that they can visit them. I welcome that that is contained in the plan. It gives a clear roadmap for those families who wish to visit loved ones in residential care settings. I hope the Government will be able to develop an all-island response, both North and South. I know the acting CMO here in the Republic is in discussions with his counterpart in the North. That is a very important part of any future plan. Care and assistance in our communities, which is one of the three pillars in the roadmap, is critical. The local authorities are playing a crucial role in this. As I have mentioned in the Chamber previously, the local authority community calls represent an essential part of engaging with those who are isolating or cocooning. Volunteers in sports clubs and other groups have given their time to deliver groceries and medicines to people. I also commend the library service which is delivering audiobooks and engaging with those who cannot or do not want to leave their homes. I hope the Government will take this on board. As we work with this roadmap in the next six or nine months - it could be longer - we need to bear in mind outpatient appointments and screening services. Many people with other ailments may be nervous of going into a hospital or healthcare setting. It is very important to keep those services running as much as possible, irrespective of the level we are at. It is equally important that partners and husbands are permitted to attend maternity appointments. That issue needs to be dealt with. Earlier my colleagues spoke about sports. While training is taking place and it is very important for children, it is critical for mental health. The green ribbon campaign was launched today. The two of them are part and parcel. I hope there will be improvements to the Covid app. I suggested some improvements through the parliamentary question system and the Minister might take them on board.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Sadly, it has been announced this evening that another four people have died of Covid-19. I offer my condolences to their families and to all those that have lost loved ones to Covid-19 here in Ireland. We have known this winter would be a significant challenge since the Covid-19 pandemic emerged here in March. The pandemic, combined with the flu season, will place enormous challenges on our health service and front-line workers. Pre-Covid, many of our hospitals were already operating at 90-95% capacity. I welcome today's announcement of the €600 million financial commitment made by the Government for this winter plan. In particular, I welcome the plan to provide 892 acute beds with 484 sub-acute beds. The extra capacity will be crucial this winter. The extra 500 isolation beds will provide reassurance that capacity exists if Covid cases continue to increase. At the heart of the strategy to combat Covid is the strong testing and tracing infrastructure. Extra funding to bring our public health teams to in excess of 3,000 professionals is welcome, as is the commitment to bring the capacity to more than 100,000 test per week. The flu vaccine will be issued to more than 1.5 million people over the coming weeks, starting with front-line workers, schoolchildren and vulnerable members of the community. I welcome innovative plans to allow pharmacists to inoculate people in their cars and other socially distant locations. I am sure all in the House are grateful for the flexibility pharmacists have shown. I welcome the additional 4.7 million home support hours. People with a disability and the elderly have made huge sacrifices during this pandemic. Many of them lost home care supports during the acute phase of the lockdown in April and May, and this support was gradually reintroduced. Supporting people at home and helping them avoid the need to attend a hospital is critical in this pandemic, particularly as we head into the winter months. The extra support for home help hours is welcome and necessary. Earlier today, we were informed that St. John of God, which provides crucial services not only to my own constituency in Dún Laoghaire but across south Dublin and indeed the rest of the country to more than 8,000 adults and children with disability and their families, would be withdrawing from its HSE contract. The announcement has caused great concern worry in the community, and many people have been in contact with my office today. Covid-19 has been exceptionally difficult for those families, and this is adding an additional stress and strain. I ask the Minister to intervene directly with the HSE. We must ensure continuity of service for this cohort. I hope the Minister can give us assurances this evening.
