CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for being delayed. I will start with some questions concerning the opening statement. I apologise as well if some of these questions have been posed already. I welcome Ms Forbes and her team. It is good to see everybody again. Turning to the opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General, concerning the additional funding provided to support enhanced programming during the Covid-19 pandemic, I am aware of the educational programmes that were broadcast. I commend them, because they were very informative and beneficial, given that schools were closed at the time and there was online learning. Those programmes were good productions and really well done. I praise the people behind those programmes. What other types of programming were funded from that additional allocation given in 2020? Regarding the licence fee, I noticed that roughly the same amount of money was collected in 2019 as in 2020. Ms Forbes said that there was a rate of a little over 15% for non-payment of the licence fee. What steps are being taken in that regard, or what kind of review of the process is underway, to try to reduce that figure? It has climbed year on year, if I am not mistaken. A similar figure is provided in Ms Forbes' opening statement concerning more than 15% of people who classify themselves as having no television, if I am not mistaken on that aspect. Moving to the mention that was made of the critical upgrading of studio and broadcasting infrastructure, what kind of percentage of RTÉ's overall spending is being spent on replacing that equipment? Those are my questions for now.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The third part was about the percentage of spend on the replacement of equipment in RTÉ.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Forbes mentioned in her opening statement the large-scale organisational restructure being undertaken. I note the issues regarding gender pay. I understand RTÉ is participating in a working group with the Department as one of 500 other organisations. Specifically regarding the large-scale organisational restructuring in RTÉ and given the challenges Ms Forbes just spoke about in the media sector, particularly public service broadcasting, can she point to any other organisation similar to RTÉ anywhere around the globe that she would like RTÉ to emulate in respect of digital content, news and current affairs and other general programming, or is it a unique challenge here? If one looks across the water to the BBC, for example, and what has happened there with the licence fee and the challenges it faces, it is quite similar for public service broadcasting, but can she point to any other jurisdiction where she would say there is a good balance and a good mix and it is something she would like to replicate here?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is my time up, Chairman?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Forbes also mentioned in her opening statement, with regard to the casual contractors who were ultimately offered contracts, that 82 contracts were offered and there were 79 acceptances. Without naming anybody, can she give us a rough reason for the other three individuals deciding not to accept? I assume they were doing regular work and would have accepted a contract.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Forbes might send a note. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman. It is an important update to recognise given the discussions we have had with the OPW on this previously. If I am not mistaken, it was December of 2020 that we were told there would be a resolution to this early in the new year and, obviously, Covid-19 got in the way of that. It is in all our interests that this issue be resolved as soon as possible. It looks like there seems to be a resolution now, which is to be welcomed.
