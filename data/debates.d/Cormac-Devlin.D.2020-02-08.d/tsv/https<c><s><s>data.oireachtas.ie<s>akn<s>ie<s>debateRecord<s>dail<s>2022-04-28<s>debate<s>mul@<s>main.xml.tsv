CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I also express my condolences to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on the passing of his mother. I would be grateful if the Minister of State could update the House on the Government's insurance reform agenda and the work being carried out to ensure the benefits are being passed on to consumers.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We have seen those reductions particularly in motor insurance. People have experienced them. There has been good feedback from younger drivers in particular. That was a perennial issue for many years. Reducing the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses is critical, particularly when we see costs increase in energy, retail and other areas. I welcome the priority given to this issue by the Government. I acknowledge the work done in this area by the Ministers of State, Deputies Fleming, Troy and James Browne, and also by the Ministers for Finance; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Justice. I commend them on their efforts because from the get-go they have engaged with the insurance companies and we are seeing the benefits. The personal injury guidelines are clearly having impacts on the size of awards. Some 20% of awards are now under €5,000 and 29% are between €5,000 and €10,000, which means nearly half the awards are under €10,000. That compares with just 12% in 2020. Will the Minister of State give an indication of progress on the remaining actions in the Government's action plan on insurance reform?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Given the very significant reduction in the cost of awards, as I outlined, and the introduction of other measures, consumers and businesses will expect proportionate reductions in premiums to bring them into line with EU averages. I think we are seeing that. Consumers are certainly feeling that when they renew or examine other policies. If that trend continues, we will be in a very good position and more aligned with our EU counterparts than before. The work being undertaken is being felt by consumers at a critical time given the rise in costs in other areas.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Minister will be aware the National Transport Authority, NTA, has licensed Aircoach to operate six routes connecting Dublin Airport with Dublin, Cork, Galway and Belfast cities. It must be acknowledged that management and staff, particularly the drivers at Aircoach, deserve great credit for keeping the service running during Covid-19. However, I have been contacted by customers who use a free travel pass and who find themselves disadvantaged as they cannot book an Aircoach ticket online. It is the only way of guaranteeing a seat on a particular service. Since passenger volumes have returned to normal, this has caused great anxiety. I am aware Irish Rail provide an online booking system for customers with the travel pass, which is very convenient. I have contacted Aircoach about this issue but have not received a reply. Will the Minister raise the issue, asking that the matter would be raised with the NTA, which is responsible for regulating, supervising and licensing the service, to ensure people with a travel pass are not disadvantaged?
