CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As I have not spoken before, I shall start with Professor Sweeney who referred to the UK Act in his opening statement. I ask him to elaborate on the big differences between what is proposed in this Bill and what the UK has adopted. The professor referred to language in his opening remarks and one of his observations recommended the use of the sentence, "The State shall achieve the transition to a climate resilient and climate neutral economy by the end of the year 2050". I understand the reason for his recommendation as it would bind future Governments to decisions. What happens when targets are met and achieved?  Dr. Jackson referred to the Climate Change Advisory Council. Who does he suggest should make up the CCAC?
