CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Ms Murphy-Fagan and her colleagues and Mr. Costello from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In terms of the number of overruns over the years, on which some of the questions have already been asked, I note the National Shared Services Office was established in 2014 after a Government decision in 2012. It officially commenced in 2018 and this project was given a green light in January 2016. Colleagues have asked about the new target date nine years after the original indication that this financial management shared service would be established. It is a considerable delay, Covid or no Covid. I accept what Ms Murphy-Fagan has said in her responses thus far. I note it is a mammoth task to amalgamate the 31 different systems. How old and varied are those systems that the office is trying to amalgamate? I note what Ms Murphy-Fagan said earlier in response to another question about the staff who are already working in the various Departments. What are the old systems on which they are operating?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was not factored in.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that. I am sorry but I have limited time. Will Ms Murphy-Fagan give us an indication on the number of years? She might come back to the committee with the years to which those older systems date back. That would be important. I want to pick up on something. Ms Murphy-Fagan mentioned the external reviews. I note there were several of them, in May 2018 and in February and May 2019. Does Ms Murphy-Fagan have the costs for each of these?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Ms Murphy-Fagan just have the cost of each of these reports?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that. Again, Ms Murphy-Fagan might come back to us with the cost. It seems that today is all about costs. I accept the system is complex and that deadlines are moved but the sheer volume of costs we are speaking about is phenomenal. Ms Murphy-Fagan might come back to the committee on this. I want to turn to fraud. Internal fraud of â‚¬30,500 was detected in 2019. It took place in 2018 and 2019. Has that money been recouped yet?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is no problem. If I can, in the last minute of my time, I will ask a question of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I understand improved internal controls have been put in place in the NSSO and I note the Comptroller and Auditor General meets the NSSO's audit and risk committee once a year. Perhaps the Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General might inform us as to whether the internal controls have improved from their perspective.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to raise two elements which I do not believe have been touched on. According to the reports, in 2019, the NSSO had 750 staff. How many are on secondment from other Departments or organisations?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There are other elements on which Ms Murphy-Fagan might come back to me, which we discussed earlier, namely the age of the various systems the organisation is amalgamating with the new system and the cost of those external reviews. The NSSO is a stand-alone organisation. It has offices in Dublin, Kerry, Galway and Offaly. Are they leased, owned or shared with other organisations? Can Ms Murphy-Fagan give a breakdown on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I presume those leases are from third parties.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Murphy-Fagan might come back to the committee on some of those costs. The conversation today has been on costs associated with the NSSO and the financial management shared services. It would be interesting to delve into that area also. I thank Ms Murphy-Fagan and her colleagues for giving of their time today.
