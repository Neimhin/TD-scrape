CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our guests and thank them for their attendance and remarks, particularly the Secretary General and his colleagues. I welcome the change in culture and message that if people are sick, they should stay away, and the remarks about the number one priority of the Department being reopening the schools. It is a good place to start. I spoke with a number of the teacher representatives who were here on Tuesday. It is good to see that everybody is on the same side. My first question is for the Secretary General. How soon after Covid hit did planning begin on the reopening of schools?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Ó Foghlú for that. Assuming everything goes to plan and schools are reopened in September, I note this morning there is talk of additional funding for both substitute teachers and the cleaning of schools. While Mr. Ó Foghlú touched on cleansing earlier in response to some of the questions, does he have a figure for the amount of additional money the Department is talking about, particularly for those principals who may be watching and wondering about additional teachers? We know there is a challenge in securing substitute teachers at the best of times. Can Mr. Ó Foghlú touch on the cost of this?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Once complete and issued to schools, will this roadmap help the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the roadmap needed for special schools and children or adults with disabilities? Will Mr. Ó Foghlú's Department work with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Very good. I have just two more questions for the Secretary General and then two for Mr. Loftus. I might as well ask them all together. The first concerns after-school activities. What is the likely guidance to schools on after-school or extracurricular activities based on school premises? The second question is more of a perennial issue, which is the weight of schoolbags. Perhaps this is an opportunity for schools to apply to a fund for lockers to try to enable pupils to leave schoolbooks on the school premises. Obviously, there is a health and safety benefit in the context of Covid if schoolbooks are left on the premises and not taken back home when not necessary.I have a couple of questions for Mr. Loftus in relation to school space and accommodation. If the school itself is small and social distancing is impossible, will there be a fund available for either renting additional space or providing additional space, be it Portakabins or whatever? Is that in the pipeline? Second, if a school has small numbers but the school building is large and there is a possibility of splitting the classes, will there be an opportunity for schools to apply for additional teachers so that those class numbers can be reduced, bearing in mind that some of the class sizes exceed the normal class sizes? They might come back to me on those.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, if I may, where the schools have the space and where there is a possibility of facilitating those classrooms, I urge the Department to try to ensure that a fund is made available to those schools to employ additional teachers in order that those class sizes are reduced and, indeed, the space is given for socially-distanced education.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms McGinley and Ms McKeown for their attendance today as well as for their contributions and opening statements which were enlightening and are much appreciated. This issue, as they are well aware, came to public prominence at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic. In my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire we do not have meat processing plants. It does not directly affect my area but that is not a reason to be here or not to be here. I welcome the fact Migrant Rights Centre Ireland is here and this is a very good forum in which to air the issues they have highlighted. I would go so far as to say that this is not, unfortunately, isolated to meat processing or any type of industry for that matter. Looking at this from the point of view of the work permits, which Ms McGinley touched on in her remarks, reform needs to happen because as she highlighted the employees are very much attached to the employer. That in itself brings issues. It is fine if the employer is a good employer but there is a huge problem with the not so good ones. That needs to be dealt with across the board. Could Ms McGinley and Ms McKeown elaborate on sectoral work permits and how they envisage those, particularly for non-EU workers? They also touched on the HSA inspections. Do they know how many were carried out during the height of the pandemic, bearing in mind that Ms McGinley gave a date of, I think, 15 May for guidelines being issued? On those guidelines, we are talking about people who feel isolated and cut off and almost beholden to the employer or the business they work for. Are the witnesses aware of those guidelines being issued in different languages? I am not aware of whether they were, and that is why I am asking. Ms McGinley and Ms McKeown might answer those questions and I might then come back in with some others.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I commend the work that Migrant Rights Centre Ireland is doing because without it, many of these people would be voiceless and would feel vulnerable. It is important that Ms McGinley is able to voice their concerns. I have not visited a meat packing or processing plant but I would hope the yellow signage with which we are all now familiar, such as is right here beside me and everywhere one goes, would be multilingual and that there would be particular advice for these types of industries. In its submission, Migrant Rights Centre Ireland stated that the CSO figures for 2016 show there were 12,413 employees in the sector, and around 42% of them were migrant workers. However, when work permits are added in on top of that, the figure is 15,338 and 58% of the sector are migrant workers. We are talking about quite a high volume of individuals who are potentially low-skilled and low-paid. What I said at the outset about the meat-packing industry being almost like a cluster for Covid may have been an incorrect portrayal but certainly the public perception was that were many issues in meat-packing plants. My concern is now about the inspections being announced. No one involved in the hospitality industry ever gets advance notice of a health inspector coming in and rightly so because one needs to see warts and all in order to address concerns. I am very worried if advance notice of inspections is being given because it means we will not get to the root of the problem. I was surprised at the accommodation figures because anecdotally, many people who are low-paid live together and that, therefore, would almost account for more of the cluster than the workplace. I hope this is not the last time we get to engage. I hope we can achieve much of the reform the witnesses are seeking and I appreciate their time and comments.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was remiss of me not to thank all of those working in the meat plants because it was one of the sectors, as the witnesses highlighted in their remarks, that kept going throughout the height of the pandemic. This should be acknowledged. Whatever scheme the employer or the State looks at it is certainly warranted to acknowledge appreciation. Ms McGinley said that not all factories and companies are in the same boat. We are having quite a pessimistic conversation about the meat sector but it does not involve every factory. In saying this, there are some that are particularly persistent with light-touch regulation and those are the ones we need to home in on. It has also been mentioned that there could be some undocumented workers and, particularly with the advance notification of inspections, people being told not to come in or conveniently going off shift for a little while. Will the witnesses speak about the evidence they have of this or the experiences they have been told about to enlighten us on these issues?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course not.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely. We now see that the R-nought is close to 1. That is alarming in itself, but if there were a second wave - I am reading a statement for our next session - do the witnesses think things would improve, or have they improved already? Surely the figures for the past couple of weeks indicate that all factories seem to have got on board and realised that this has to be dealt with. In addition, the number of inspections increased and the public spotlight was on the sector so, naturally, improvements happened. If, however, there were a second wave, we would have to be conscious of what we have just experienced. If the witnesses are saying the majority of all plants now have temperature controls and all the other facilities, that is welcome. However, is Ms McGinley confident, just from her experience, that the sector would continue to comply as it is complying today if there were a second wave?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Equally, from Ms McGinley's own experience, from what she has been told and from what her organisation has learned about those who reported symptoms of illness, regardless of whether it was thought to be Covid, and those who actually reported sick, can she enlighten us on her experience with workers who have come to her organisation with those experiences?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am asking about people who have reported sick or as having felt symptoms. What was their experience with the willingness of their employers to allow a day off or testing of the employee? What measures were taken to prevent a potential spread? This is the advice to which we are all adhering now.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, did the witnesses see a spike in the number of cases they were dealing with in their regular work at the outset compared with the height of the pandemic? Has this given them a massive surge in case numbers? I am assuming it has but I would just like confirmation of that.How many are we talking about? How many cases has the MRCI dealt with from March to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Carroll and the other representatives from MII for attending today. I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was responsible, before her appointment and as a member of this committee, for inviting MII in today. They are very welcome and I thank them for their opening remarks. Following on from the earlier session, I will ask about the levels of meat produced in the sector normally and that produced during the Covid pandemic. Is Mr. Carroll aware of any rapid increase in production? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there a contact tracing register in place in each company or factory? Will Mr. Carroll enlighten the committee in that regard?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is Mr. Carroll saying that each factory or processor has a Covid officer? If so, what guidelines are issued to such officers and the owner of the factory or facility? Are the guidelines being communicated to staff? As we heard during the previous session, there are language barriers for some staff. Have the guidelines been translated into other languages so that all staff are aware of the various protocols and practices required within the factories?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	First, were those protocols communicated to all of the agents or companies? Second, were the companies notified in advance of the HSA inspections?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Unannounced inspections are probably better, but I acknowledge the level of compliance Mr. Carroll outlined in his statement. Did MII view and approve all the protocols with regard to the Covid policies that had gone out to contractors? Were MII members available to public health teams for scrutiny?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Were the MII companies, the operators themselves, available to public health teams for scrutiny?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Carroll for those answers. How does he think the meat plants are capable of responding to a potential second wave of Covid? Does he think the current guidelines are sufficient, and will they remain in place?
