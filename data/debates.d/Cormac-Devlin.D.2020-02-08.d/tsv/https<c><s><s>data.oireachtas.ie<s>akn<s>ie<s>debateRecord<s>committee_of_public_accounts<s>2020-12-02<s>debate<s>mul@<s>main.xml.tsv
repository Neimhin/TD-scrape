CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman for his statement. I accept his apology to the committee and I thank him for it. There is no doubt, however, that the tweet was hurtful and that it was a glorification of what happened at Narrow Water. The Chairman's words from when we started our work ring true, namely, that we need to leave party politics at the door. We are here on behalf of the Oireachtas to scrutinise public bodies and other bodies. That said, I accept his apology. I do not think this is the place to scrutinise the tweet. That is for the DÃ¡il Chamber and it is for the Chairman and his party to reflect on whether they want to deal with the matter in that forum. I would not classify the tweet as clumsy. I do not say the Chairman did so. I hope that when he says he apologises for the tweet, it will not happen again. That is an important element because, as he rightly points out, this is a very prestigious committee within the Houses and there is an extra onus on him, as Chair. I know he accepts that and I know he understands it now.I hope, however, that we will not have this situation in respect of the Chairman again because it puts the committee into disrepute and it is something we do not want to see again. I thank the Chairman for his statement.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General about the delay in the 2018 accounts. Is there a particular reason for that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is something we can take up with them when they are here.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The delay was on the Department's end.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I suggest we do that. It might help when Caranua is here for us to have been aware of that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This is similar to the question I raised the previous time we were discussing this issue. I note in the correspondence a reference to the passage of the residential institutions statutory fund (distribution) Bill. I am not sure at what stage that is at or when to expect it in the House. However, I note they say it will not impact on the operational process of Caranua. Ultimately, our question to the Comptroller and Auditor General at the previous meeting was about the remaining funds for distribution and what happens there. It is going to form a part of our discussion with them when they are before us. If they can, through the clerk, furnish as much information as possible in advance of that, it would assist in our process of questioning.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am proposing that a number of organisations be invited to come in and I will email them to the clerk directly but I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General for his information on a number of organisations on the list of organisations he provided to the committee. Could he give a brief explainer on the local loans fund and the heritage fund, because depending on his answer it might be of interest to us to put them on the work programme. Others are the sundry moneys deposit account and the State property miscellaneous deposits account. I was unsure about the basis of NSCDA Operations Limited. A final one is the hepatitis C accounts. I can see that a number of those are still in operation. Are they still operational accounts?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Who manages that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, the State property miscellaneous deposits account.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am sorry.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be very helpful.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McCarthy for that. Any explanation on some of these funds would be helpful. For our own purposes it would be interesting to link them to the Departments or organisations they are part of because when they are before us we can ask questions on that. I will correspond with the clerk on this but the other items are the National Council for Special Education and the National Disability Authority. I do not know if they have been before the committee in the recent past but the clerk might liaise on that.  I am not sure whether the residential institutions redress special account falls under the Department of Finance or-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. The others are the Medical Council, the Secret Service, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the Pensions Authority, the Trade and Business Development Body and Waterways Ireland. I will email those to the clerk.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McCarthy.
