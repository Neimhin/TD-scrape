CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Dr. Muldoon and his team and it is good to engage with them again. I am sure the Chairman will tell me I do not have as long as I want but I have quite a bit to ask about. In fairness to Dr. Muldoon, his opening statement was very thorough. It gave us many interesting points to ponder and on which to engage with him and his office. In his opening statement Dr. Muldoon mentioned the 2019 Progress for Children report. From what he said about that, it is so broad and there is so much in it that I suggest we invite Dr. Muldoon and his staff back again to talk about that specifically because I do not think we will do it justice in the few minutes each of us have. That would be my first suggestion. On the very timely publication of Jack's Case: One Year On, which Dr. Muldoon said was published just yesterday, having read it, and it too is exceptionally thorough, I want to ask a few things about it. Dr. Muldoon might speak to it because he will be able to give more background. I am conscious of people who are viewing the committee and might not be aware of the full facts. The report states Jack is now nine, having first come to the attention of the HSE disability services when he was four. What struck me most is that, when Dr. Muldoon investigated Jack's case, he found the administrative actions of both the HSE and Tusla had a negative impact on his life. That line in the report stood out for me. I was just at the Committee of Public Accounts and the HSE was before us discussing CAMHS. Dr. Muldoon a moment ago mentioned the issue in Kerry. We are very aware of the failings of that particular service, but here we are and Jack is only one individual on whom the ombudsman has completed a report. I am sure there have been others. For us, as public representatives, it is quite scary to read that line. On top of that, the report also said Jack was deemed medically ready for discharge from hospital in August 2017, which begs the question, if the Office for Ombudsman for Children was only alerted in January 2018, and he was discharged eventually the previous August, how long was he actually in the care? The positive news is that Jack was thriving when Dr. Muldoon last met him. That is fantastic and I commend Dr. Muldoon and the team on the work they have done. It must be exceptionally satisfying, having come across such a failing of the system, of all different parts of the system, which is quite unnerving, to see he is now doing so well. I will let Dr. Muldoon speak to the recommendations and the various conclusions. There is a positive side to Jack's case but I raise it, and I ask Dr. Muldoon to speak to it, because I am sure there are other cases similar to Jack's of which we are not aware. I will hand over to Dr. Muldoon. I have other questions as well.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Leonard. Dr. Muldoon mentioned the case of Molly. Through the Chair, I request that when the ombudsman produces this type of report, he consider sending copies to the committee for our consideration and engagement with him and his colleagues if time permits and it is suitable. When did the case of Molly take place? I am not familiar with that report. What year was it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was in 2018 or 2019.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Tusla is not an old organisation. In large part, it came from the HSE. Mr. Leonard used the word "siloing". Unfortunately, I have come across examples of it myself. Things can fall between two stools and nobody takes responsibility. That was not the aim of the Child and Family Agency. As Dr. Muldoon is well aware, we had a referendum on children that was meant to try to put their needs and priorities first. If I heard it correctly, it was stated that there are 400 children in a situation similar to that in Molly's case which, in itself, is frightening. I hear what Mr. Leonard is saying. There are ten recommendations that are quite interesting in themselves. I note that Jack made his first Holy Communion recently, which is positive news. He does seem to be thriving, which is excellent. I may come back in as I have other questions. I will let Deputy Higgins come in first. To conclude on this issue, it is stated on page 12 of the report: The HSE told us that, informed by the learning of the needs of children with complex disability who were, and currently are, in acute hospitals beyond medical need, a HSE/Tusla ‘Jack Report Working Group’ are working on a national review of the current need for alternative care for this cohort of children.Are those the 400 children to whom reference was made or is it a separate cohort? Obviously, Molly's case is different. It relates more to foster families.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It reminds me of the situation for adults who have complex needs as a result of a change-of-life experience and are effectively hostages in a hospital because there is no alternative placement for them. The difference for them is they may have siblings or next of kin who can speak on their behalf, whereas in the case instanced, we are talking about a vulnerable child effectively left to his or her own devices in a hospital without anyone looking at his or her needs. I will follow up on the working group. When was it established?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are our guests going to tell me it was yesterday, like the report?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. I appreciate that. I will come back in as I have other questions. I thank our guests.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In his opening remarks Dr. Muldoon mentioned, and Deputy Higgins just touched on, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. I noticed Dr. Muldoon also stated later on that there was an increase in referrals to his office directly from children themselves. Has he had any kind of dealings with the Department of Education? I believe it is section 28 where if a child is refused entry an appeal then has to be made directly to the Department. Perhaps it is section 38 or something like that. Has Dr. Muldoon had any dealings with the Department directly on those kind of cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Dr. Muldoon would be aware that, obviously, every action has a consequence, because by that being removed, depending on how established an area is, that has an knock-on effect for people who may have thought that their children were going to go to X school and now realising that, depending on population growth or whatever in that area, that has a knock-on effect. I understand the rationale behind it absolutely. I would like to comment on Dr. Muldoon’s report on direct provision and his latest report, Childhood Paused. I believe his report on direct provision was titled Direct Division. I compliment him on the titling of his reports because it is important to speak to the content and tone of the report. We have spoken before about direct provision. I am also delighted he has increased his staff because if I recall correctly, that was one of the issues and challenges he was facing at the time, although it has not increased that much since we last spoke.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is very positive news. When Dr. Muldoon said in 2020 he saw a small increase in numbers of direct referrals, he touched on schooling, concern about calculated grades and all that, but also the mental health impact and the restrictions. I think I speak for all of my colleagues here when I say that we have all seen it in our respective constituency offices. Unfortunately, that will be seen for quite some time yet. What kind of issues were presenting? When Dr. Muldoon said he was concerned about mental health and the impact the restrictions were having, what kind of issues can he outline?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The children themselves were very involved and engaged with us as public representatives on that, which was good to see. It allowed them to vent a little too and articulate their concerns about what was facing them. It was not an easy time at all, but it is nice to see normality returning. Speaking of school, Dr. Muldoon mentioned the impact of school closures. He specifically referenced children with disabilities, which is correct because online learning was not something some of them could engage with for long periods, if at all, as well as children who are homeless, children with mental health issues, children living in direct provision and Traveller and Roma children. I argue there is a cohort who may not have fitted into any of those categories, namely, children from low-income families who did not have the ability to engage properly with technology. They may have had an iPhone. I had experience of this, where there was an iPhone in the house but that is not sufficient for looking at documents and so forth on screens, as we know. There is a gap in that regard. I will not touch on assessments of need because that was addressed by Deputy Buckley. Deputy Higgins referred to the online safety commissioner in the context of her experience with the other committee of which she is a member. I was taken with what Dr. Muldoon said about the online safety commissioner being of concern to him. Will he elaborate a little further on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is it fair to say that more work needs to be done in order to satisfy the concerns of the ombudsman?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank all the representatives for those very comprehensive answers. This is ever so slightly outside the remit of today's discussion because the reports are from 2018 to 2020, although the 2018 report would be sufficient to cover my question. I notice that for some reason there is a spike in the number of complaints listed on the ombudsman's website for May 2017. They are head and shoulders above everything else and there was no pandemic at that time. Does anybody have any reason for such an increase?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. I very much thank everybody for their engagement. Unfortunately, I will have to switch off my camera. I look forward to further engaging with the representatives in detail on that report and to talking with them again.
