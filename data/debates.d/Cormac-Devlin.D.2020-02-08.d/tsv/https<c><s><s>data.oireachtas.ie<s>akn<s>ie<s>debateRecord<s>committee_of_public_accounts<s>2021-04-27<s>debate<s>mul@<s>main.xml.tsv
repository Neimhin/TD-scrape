CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Like my colleague, I compliment RTÉ at the outset concerning its 'school on TV' initiative which ran during the lockdown. It was really beneficial for many primary school students during that time. It was well done and well produced. Well done on that. Turning to the reduction in the deficit run by RTÉ, it was €13 million in 2018 and that was down to €7 million in 2019. I note that Ms Forbes spoke of some cost-cutting measures, but how was that deficit reduction achieved?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Staying with finance, what proportion of income generated in 2019 and 2020 by RTÉ came from the licence fee? I note that Ms O'Shea said there was an increase in the amount allocated from the licence fee to RTÉ. That contrasted with commercial revenue, which Ms O'Shea stated has reduced in recent years.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The remainder then is commercial revenue. Is it correct that this is the other funding stream for RTÉ?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am not sure who is going to take this next question, but the last appearance by Ms Forbes before this committee was in May 2018 and a report was compiled in July of that year. I note that public funding in 2016, for instance, was €179.3 million, while commercial revenue stood at €158.2 million. Where do those figures stand today compared to 2016? Has RTÉ's commercial revenue improved since 2016 or has the licence fee income improved? I ask that because I note that Ms Forbes stated in her opening remarks that the evasion rate for the licence fee was in and around 15% for 2020. Back in 2018, it was similar enough at about 15% as well. Is that the average percentage of evasion? I ask Ms Forbes to deal with the issue of the comparison between commercial revenue and licence fee income first, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand. If I can turn to the task RTÉ has ahead of itself in the context of digital content, when she was last before the committee in May 2018, Ms Forbes recognised that this is a major challenge for RTÉ in this regard. How has the organisation championed that in the past number of years and how has it improved matters on the digital front?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Forbes for that. In terms of the evasion rate and the collection for the licence fee, Ms Forbes has been a big advocate of reforming the licence fee and what it is charged for. She mentioned that we have one of the highest average rates of collection in Europe. Can she explain why the cost of collection and the evasion rate are higher here than in other jurisdictions across Europe?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will come back to the Department in the second round. Finally, can Ms Forbes indicate the percentage home-grown programming and productions versus other content that RTÉ purchases on an annual basis? Has she a percentage breakdown in that regard?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be very helpful. Do I have time for one more question?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thought so. I thank Ms Forbes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have a question for the departmental officials. I said I would come back to the issue of the licence fee. I know there was a talk of a renewal or a rejig of the fee. A working group was set up in the previous Dáil. What status does that have at present? Why is the cost for the collection of the licence fee so high in Ireland in comparison with our European counterparts? I will not say the Department's full name because that would take up more time than I have.
