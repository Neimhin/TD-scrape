CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Spratt, Mr. Clonan and their colleagues. It is good to see them again and have them before the committee. I will stay with the issue of transport. It is important that we as a committee not only look back through the 2020 accounts but also that we look at what is being planned. My colleagues spoke about MetroLink, DART+, the DART underground and other projects. Mr. Spratt or Mr. Doocey might come back to me on this. I know that this pre-dates Mr. Spratt's term as Secretary General. Over the past ten years or more, what has been done to progress the issue? We initially had Metro North. Now it is MetroLink. The greater Dublin transport strategy was unveiled two days ago. There have been changes to what was envisaged five or ten years ago, or even longer. What has been the Department's involvement, putting aside what the NTA does in guiding the planning process, in making this a reality and seeing this vision of MetroLink come to fruition?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Doocey for that overview. He mentioned 2018 and costs associated with pre-planning and consultation. I accept what he is saying about it being a mammoth task. No one denies that. Does he have an indicative number for the cost of the revised plan? I know we have been here before to discuss the metro. How much has been spent to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Doocey. I have limited time. In a one-word answer, when does Mr. Doocey expect to have a decision about the preliminary business case that has been submitted to the Department?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Doocey. Before I ask questions of Mr. Clonan, since I have limited time, I have questions about the search and rescue service. Forgive me if this question was asked in my absence. When reading the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, I was struck by the fact that this dates back to 2013 and the 24 NVIS goggles that were purchased. That is expensive equipment and I heard the Secretary General say that we are the first in the world to use it in a private contract capacity. It has taken an extraordinary length of time to complete the training when one considers that one base has been trained since 2013. I do not know how that can be presented to the Committee of Public Accounts as good value for money when it clearly is not. The Comptroller and Auditor General has raised his concerns, and rightly so. Can we get a date for when all the SAR bases will be trained? Will that be done within the next 12 months?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Apologies for interrupting but-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the regulatory requirement that Mr. Clonan mentioned, how come one party was already trained in the absence of that? Am I correct in stating that one base was trained up in 2018 or 2019? How come that training proceeded and the training for the others has not? Would Mr. Clonan accept that this has taken a very long time?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman for allowing me in a second time. I wish to focus in on the Coast Guard with Mr. Clonan. I note from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that 18, I think, vehicles were purchased. There were issues with procurement but I have heard what the Secretary General has said in that regard on reform around procurement, which is welcome. An issue I raised last May, of which Mr. Clonan might be aware, was one brought to my attention by members and volunteers from the Coast Guard about the use of the vehicles. He gave me a response at the time saying there are rules around the use of those vehicles. However, what I was saying at the time was that if members were allowed bring them to their homes it could increase response times. The reports I had at the time were members were leaving their home, going to the base, collecting the vehicle and then going to the scene. Mr. Clonan said correctly that not all members had to go to base. They could leave the vehicles at home. Has there been any progress on that? Given my limited time, he might send a note on that if he cannot come back to me immediately after this. My second question is for Mr. Spratt and concerns an area of great interest to me, namely, planning for major incidents, be they regional or national and relating to rail, road, sea or air. How frequently are the emergency services and other agencies engaged in training in these areas? I mention also co-ordination between local authorities. I am aware of one local authority where its disaster communications centre needs to be relocated from its main building. The officials cannot hypothesise about various incidents but given the potential scale of one of these incidents, how prepared are we as a State to deal with such incidents? I do not mind whether Mr. Clonan or Mr. Spratt come in first.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Clonan might send me a note on the use of the vehicles and maybe a breakdown of how frequent is "frequent" because I would like to know those exercises are being done being done biannually or whatever. They are really important.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Very good. I thank Mr. Clonan.
