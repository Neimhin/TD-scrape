CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their opening remarks. I note from their opening statements that passenger numbers are almost 99% lower than 2019 levels, which is extremely worrying.As an island nation we are all acutely aware that connectivity is essential. I acknowledge this pandemic has been exceptionally difficult for the airline industry. Covid-19 will have implications well past the summer. Unfortunately, as the committee heard earlier from the DAA, job losses will be inevitable in Dublin airport in particular. It employs 21,500 people and supports 100,000 other jobs. The air transport sector is estimated to support â‚¬8.9 billion of GDP and many jobs in Ireland.  I thank the airlines, their crews and pilots for their work in the initial phase of the pandemic in securing essential medical supplies and bringing them to Ireland. That was much appreciated by the public. I hope they will pass on the committee's thanks and best wishes to the staff involved.  My first question is to Mr. Wilson from Ryanair. Does he think his airline's campaign of encouraging people to travel to countries on the green list undermines the advice being given by the Government and public health advisers in this jurisdiction about avoiding non-essential travel?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Wilson for his response but I beg to differ. According to figures from the European Centre for Disease control, some of the EU countries which Mr. Wilson says should be on the list have incidence rates that are ten times higher.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is interesting that Mr. Wilson highlighted Germany. I note that the incidence of Covid is 50% higher there than in Ireland.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is 100,000 in Ireland, where there are 5.2 cases. I accept Mr. Wilson's bona fides as to why he wants all countries on some sort of green list and I understand the need for this. He must also understand that, from a public health and policy perspective, we must try to slow the spread of Covid. No one is suggesting that we can prevent it from coming inside our borders entirely. I accept that the airlines are under immense pressure. As I said earlier, I thank them and their pilots and crew for their work in the initial phase. That work was essential in the context of bringing PPE to Ireland. The biggest issue now is how we live with Covid. I imagine that the green list will change. I wish to ask representatives from both airlines how they perceive the airports in Ireland compared with those they are dealing with in other countries now. I ask Aer Lingus to respond first.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Returning to airline safety, my biggest concern is Ryanair's email campaign to previous customers telling them that they have the green light, which is encouraging people to travel. This flies in the face of public health advice in Ireland. Obviously, essential travel is different, but it seems that Ryanair is encouraging people who are looking at non-essential travel to do that. All members have received queries about refunds. We probably do not have time to get into that matter today. That has certainly been an issue for people who had bookings with Ryanair and who need to get those refunds.
