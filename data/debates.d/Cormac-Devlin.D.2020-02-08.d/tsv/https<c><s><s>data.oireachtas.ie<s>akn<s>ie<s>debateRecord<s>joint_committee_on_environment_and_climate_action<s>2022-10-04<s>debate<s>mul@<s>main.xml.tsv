CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I very much thank Mr. Fenlon and his colleagues for attending. The issue of the standing charge has come up quite a bit. I ask for a note to be sent to the committee on the calculation of that charge. I have received feedback, as have colleagues on the committee, regarding people who are extremely apprehensive about having no wriggle room in respect of that charge. It has increased over the past while, so a briefing note on it would be most welcome. I will turn to an issue also raised by my colleague, Senator Dooley, namely, that of customers being told to use appliances at off-peak times - we have seen those rates increase over the past while - and what was said about 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. being the hours for the cheapest rates for some of the tariffs Electric Ireland is offering. That has, for example, implications for multi-unit developments, such as apartment complexes, where everyone is running machines. We then get complaints regarding noise. We obviously have to consider more social hours. However, people who are trying their best to consume less energy, and at the most beneficial times as regards charges, feel snookered right now because they are being told to use energy off peak but off-peak rates are going up at a rate of knots. I ask for an answer to that. I note that â‚¬3 million has been set aside for the hardship fund. How many customers does Electric Ireland expect to avail of that? The company has earmarked that amount. It would be interesting to hear what its expectation is in that regard. Equally, on smart meters, I know that Electric Ireland works with many of the charities in the context of pay-as-you-go meters, but sometimes the problem with them is the delay in getting them installed. How many requests for pay-as-you-go meters are outstanding with Electric Ireland right now? If I have time, I will come back in later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there an approximate figure? Electric Ireland has set aside a certain amount, so it must know, or even have a guesstimate, of how many customers it is looking at.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have just a minute left. The difficulty during Covid was that people were still in receipt of money and, in the vast majority of cases, were still working. This is a cost-of-living crisis. People may be working but they do not have enough set aside to cover the cost of energy. That number may exceed what Electric Ireland earmarked for Covid.Mr. Fenlon made a point about individuals being reluctant or maybe unable to move over to a smart meter. What is Electric Ireland doing for its existing customer base? This is a problem for all utilities. A customer who is locked into a traditional tariff does not get a call to say that there is a cheaper rate. What is Electric Ireland doing to incentivise, encourage and inform its existing customer base, notwithstanding those customers it will inherit from Panda and others that have exited the market? What is it doing to ensure that those who are already with Electric Ireland know that better tariffs are available to them?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Electric Ireland is promoting that externally. It is promoting that to all customers. What is it doing for its existing customer base? Is it doing any direct mailing or targeting to inform the existing customer base?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them very much for their engagement this afternoon. I compliment the engagement that ESB Networks has with us in the Oireachtas through the company's Oireachtas team, which is very proactive and responsive to queries. That is appreciated. In the opening statement it was mentioned that ESB Networks plans, builds, maintains and operates the electricity distribution network. It was further stated that the system is evolving and it is to become a low-carbon electricity network where 80% of the electricity generated in Ireland will come from renewable sources by 2030. We have a national target to meet and ESB Networks has a target to meet by 2030 and onward to 2050. What progress has been made to date, in particular on solar panels? What are the plans in the short term as well as the long-term strategy? I have a few others questions but I ask Mr. Tarrant to respond to that question first please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for interrupting, but is the last scheme to which Mr. Duignan referred a community-based scheme or does it relate to businesses and so on?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Duignan might send on a note on those different schemes for the benefit of the committee. This is probably not in the ESB's remit and our guests might or might not be able to go into detail, but in light of recent events such as sabotage or attacks on energy systems and given the ESB is developing networks and protecting its own ones, has it reviewed its security? I am not asking our guests to go into detail but they might comment on the process in the background. What kind of security methods are there and have they been improved or reviewed in recent times given what is happening in the world?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Turning to substations, our guests mentioned earlier that 5 GW of renewable generation is connected to the electricity system and that during this year, between wind and solar, they expect that to increase to 5.4 GW. It may be EirGrid space but, in regard to the substations, is that the ESB's call for a development or proposals to go to EirGrid if it proposes that a new substation be built, or is that EirGrid coming to the ESB or another provider to say it needs a substation in a given location? Whose responsibility is it and how does that work?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Our guests mentioned solar and wind energy. I am wondering whether for offshore there needs to be a connection with a new offshore scheme. I am not sure whether it is a matter of distribution or transmission, because it could be either. Whose call is that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the smart metering programme, it seems the ESB has made a lot of progress, with 1 million meters supplied to the market. By the end of 2024, it hopes to have the vast majority of its customers on smart meters, quite an ambitious target given the volume of customers it has. Current events will lend themselves to people requesting them, as we saw in our previous session. What is the ESB doing to ensure that it will happen by 2024? Will it be at the start of 2024 or by the end of 2024?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My final question relates to a very local issue but one that is local to all of us. It concerns lampposts throughout the country. Some of them are owned by the ESB, I understand, while others are owned by local authorities. Do not ask me how or why that happened but that is the case, according to a reply I received to a parliamentary question. How do we go about getting one of them replaced? The council will automatically direct queries to the ESB, but I have got responses from the ESB stating that some of the lampposts are owned not by it but by the councils. How can this conundrum be resolved and can we resolve it at a meeting of this committee?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was a curveball. I could outline a stream of these lamppost numbers, but that will be for another day.
