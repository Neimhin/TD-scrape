CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have raised Standing Order 218 previously and I said that the issue would become more prevalent and it has, unfortunately. I am a new member of the committee and at the initial meeting, we were greeted with the new Standing Order 218. From my understanding of the committee prior to joining it, the Standing Order has put the kibosh on our ability to question witnesses or certainly put pressure on the Chair to ensure that there is compatibility with the Standing Orders of the House. I ask that the impact on our committee be analysed at the weekly meeting of the Oireachtas committee Chairmen and, indeed, by the Committee on Procedure, of which I understand I am now a member. I really think it only impacts on this committee and not so much on others. It is imperative that we do that because when Covid is over and we have longer than two-hour sessions with witnesses, the impact of the Standing Order will come into sharper focus and be unfair to this committee. As Deputy Catherine Murphy eloquently said, it will impact more on us as committee members and favour those who are here as witnesses. It is important that we deal with this matter as soon as possible, preferably in January before the committee meets again. I appeal to the Chairman, as the guardian of the committee, that we deal with this matter. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As a member of the committee, I take exception to what the Chairman said about him as Chairman and other committees not having to jostle over certain issues. I think the Committee of Public Accounts does trump a number of committees. They may decide they want to discuss certain issues with certain witnesses but from the point of view of public accountability, we should have the privilege of inviting witnesses in and discussing certain issues irrespective of whether another committee also wants to do that because we cut through the issue of whether it has a certain departmental aspect, be it health or education. We can still invite them in and it is important for this committee to retain the ability to do that. Standing Order 218 affects our ability to question those witnesses. Irrespective of whether any other committee has standing in the House to do that with that organisation, we should still be able to do that. I would not like us to lose that ability. I would like us to retain it and through the Chairman, I would like us to push for that more. As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, of all committees, this committee needs to ensure that Standing Order 218 has a better re-balancing for committee members.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. We can still invite them in.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree with Deputy Colm Burke and getting feedback from the parties and from the Oireachtas committee chairpersons would be important. It probably has more of an impact on the Committee of Public Accounts than any other committee but it would be important to tease out the discussions the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts has had with other committee chairs. Is there a weekly meeting of committee chairpersons? When do committee chairpersons meet?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thought it was frequent-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is it mainly an issue for this committee?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It will change the dynamic of this committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On that, my understanding is that members of this committee who are also members of the CPP may not be able to sit in on the discussion at the CPP. I await clarification of that but that is my understanding. I made it clear on my appointment to the CPP that I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts. I do not know who else is in that position. If that is the case, it changes the dynamic as well.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If I am the only member who is a member of both committees, I will be happy to clarify the matter myself. I was not a full-time member of the Committee on Procedure. I was standing in for somebody else at the time this arose. There will be many members who will be members of both committees at times. The issue around Standing Order 218 needs to be resolved for this committee in particular.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will that be in January?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the procedure for questioning witnesses on correspondence sent in after an appearance at the Committee of Public Accounts? How soon does a body come back after an appearance?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. In terms of Miesian Plaza, I remember their response on that. They stated that it would hopefully be concluded quite soon. We might monitor that over the next couple of months. If it is not resolved as they had indicated to the committee, we might reinvestigate that over time.
