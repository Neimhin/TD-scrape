CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their opening statements. We all want to see a national children's hospital built, completed and fully operational as soon as possible. During our last engagement, we heard about the number of claims that were potentially outstanding. As other speakers noted, it is extremely regrettable and very worrying that we cannot get a handle on the cost. We are here on behalf of the public to establish the costs to, and potential exposure of, the public purse in respect of this project. For the witnesses to come here this morning and say they cannot estimate that cost, or will not do so out of fear of litigation, is worrying from our perspective and will be worrying for the public. That is not to take away from the importance and strategic nature of the children's hospital. I look forward to visiting the site again. I was there before when I was on the HSE's regional health forum prior to being elected to the DÃ¡il. I look forward to seeing the progress made on site. I have a number of questions for the witnesses. Colleagues have asked about claims. I refer to the report of this committee in 2019 arising out of its engagement with the witnesses. Recommendation No. 1 stood out for me. It notes: "The Committee finds it absolutely unacceptable that nobody can give a reasonably accurate estimate of the expected final costs for the completion and fitting out of the National Children's Hospital." Two years later, we are still none the wiser and that is why I am so worried. It is really concerning that, two years on and given the delays that have occurred, both the witnesses from the board and the Department still cannot estimate the cost. Recommendation No. 2 in the report states:The Committee agrees with the recommendations presented in PwC's New Children's Hospital Independent review of escalation of costs, April 2019. The Committee recommends that all 11 recommendations in review are implemented without delay.Can Mr. Gunning inform the committee whether the 11 recommendations from that PwC report have been fully implemented?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. In terms of the-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am aware of that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that the recommendations that are under the board's control are the ones Mr. Gunning is addressing. I would not ask him to comment on any others. My next question is for Ms Prendergast. Is the Department of Health satisfied those recommendations have been implemented?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is ongoing engagement anyway between the Department and the development board.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In his opening remarks, Mr. Gunning stated that he was hoping for a completion date in 2024 for the hospital. Is that early, mid or late 2024? No one foresaw this pandemic, obviously. Presuming all goes well between now and 2024, though, is he satisfied that timeframe will be adhered to?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Devine for his reply. I am conscious of my time. Mr. Gunning mentioned the digital hospital.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am sorry. I will come back in later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will ask two questions together if Mr. Gunning would not mind coming back to me. I was at another committee meeting so I ask Mr. Gunning to forgive me if he answered this question in my absence. There is a digital hospital element to the new children's hospital. Mr. Gunning has said it is going to be the first smart, digital hospital in Ireland. Give recent events in terms of ICT and the HSE cyberattack, what reassurances can Mr. Gunning give to this committee that it will be robust in its defences? I asked Mr. Gunning when he was previously before the committee about the completion date for the urgent care centre in Tallaght. Are we still on course for that date? What is that date? Are there any cost overruns or claims relating to that centre?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is absolutely the case.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good to hear. Mr. Gunning did not respond to my question about claims and cost overruns for the Tallaght centre.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What about claims?
