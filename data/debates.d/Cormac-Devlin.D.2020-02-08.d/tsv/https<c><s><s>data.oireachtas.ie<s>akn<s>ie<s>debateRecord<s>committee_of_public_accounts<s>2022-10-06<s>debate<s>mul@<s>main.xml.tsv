CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Mulvany. I want to stay with the National Ambulance Service because it has formed the main part of our questioning today. My question may be most appropriately directed to Professor O'Donnell. In the Dublin metropolitan area, there is obviously cover from the National Ambulance Service as well as the Dublin Fire Brigade. However, there is an anomaly in CHO 6 or the south-east area, where there is no paramedic cover by the Dublin Fire Brigade. What is being done to rectify that particular issue?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In CHO 6, the south-east area.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That works really well across the rest of Dublin, but there is an anomaly in the catchment area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown where there is no additional cover. If a person suffers a stroke or is involved in a car accident or, God forbid, some other sort of incident anywhere else apart from the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area, they have dual cover under the NAS and the Dublin Fire Brigade. Both resources can be called on at any given time. I understand this has been rumbling for a number of years but where does the HSE stand on resolving this? There is not the same equitable service in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area as there is elsewhere in the Dublin region. It is an anomaly that has been ongoing for a long time. Does the HSE have an update on this?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That worries me more now that Mr. Morton said that the ambulance base in Loughlinstown will be relocated. That will leave the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area with one service whereas the rest of Dublin enjoys two services. As I do not have enough time to delve into it today, I ask him to send on a note on the future plans for the NAS in the Dublin region, specifically the south-east area. I refer to an issue relating to the 2021 statement that also relates the 2020 financial statement, which is the storage of protective suits. The figure of €1.25 million spent on the storage of those suits jumped out at me. I understand from reading the documents that some of these suits will not even be used. Why was the HSE not able to store those itself? Why would it incur such a cost?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Staying with that point, Mr. Mulvany mentioned ventilators. The figure of €42.5 million was provided for the procurement of ventilators, and according to the financial accounts of 2021, I understand €12.1 million of that amount was recovered. How is the recovery of that money proceeding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have a little over a minute left and will have a rapid-fire question section. I refer to the annual report and appendix No. 4 starting on page 100. The second MRI machine for St. Vincent's is extremely welcome and it is good to see it included under the projects completed and operational by the end of 2021. I was struck by a completion delay until after 2021. The report refers to a lease agreement for a primary care centre. My understanding was that the HSE owned many of the sites in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 6 area, but it states that it is by lease agreement on page 102. I do not expect Mr. Mulvany to have that information to hand, but he might furnish that to the committee after today's meeting. Page 103 refers to the National Rehabilitation Hospital, which is based in CHO 6. Phase 1 is complete while phase 2 is ongoing with discussions under way between the Department of Health and the HSE. I also note there was a 35-bed unit with possible use by acute services, which does not fall under phase 1 or 2. It is welcome nonetheless. I ask that information on that be furnished to the committee. It relates to the refurbishment of an existing vacated building. I refer finally to appendix No. 5 on page 106 of the annual report. It struck me that the attendance of members at some of the subcommittees is quite low. What will be done about that? Is Mr. Mulvany satisfied with the attendance of the members of the committees, including the audit committee and the performance and delivery committee and others? If not, what will be done to rectify that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, some of them are.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Page 106.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. Mr Mulvany can come back to me on that. It struck me that some of the meetings were under attended.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I saw that in one or two of them, but some of them were quite low. It is something to take note of. There was one where the attendance was ten. There was one with two. That was a resignation, I understand, after a short period on the board. There was another where the average was seven and the attendance was four. A number of them seem low. If there are members of the committees-----
