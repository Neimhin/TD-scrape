CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank my proposer and seconder. I also thank the committee for its support. In his absence, I commiserate with Senator Craughwell because it has probably been the longest running election in the history of the House but it has been fought in a good spirit. I thank Senator Craughwell for his time and contribution to date.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely. Go raibh maith agat.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Go ahead, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Feeney is very welcome. I thank him for his attendance. I felt for him a moment ago as he was entering into the snake pit of talking about Independents. You could insult one Independent and have a complaint made against you, perhaps to the Press Ombudsman himself. In all seriousness, I thank Mr. Feeney for his attendance and for the opportunity for the committee to examine the annual reports from 2018 through to 2020. My colleague, Deputy Higgins, referred to the coverage over the course of the pandemic, the resilience of the press and the reliance of the public on the press for information. The press has been invaluable, and there are many trusted sources. Mr. Feeney mentioned the difference between online and print. There is definitely a difference between material produced by reputable, trained and trusted journalists and some of the online content created by individuals. Of course, there is no fact-checking of the latter, and that places a significant onus on the press and, indeed, Mr. Feeney and the Press Council. I note from Mr. Feeney's opening remarks his welcome for the online safety commissioner and the media authority. It is important to have the embrace of Mr. Feeney's office and that of the Press Council in time. It is important that it is first of all recognised that there is an issue and that it is not just a monetary issue facing media organisations. There are also issues of trust and bias involved, and public confidence needs to be restored. I note what Mr. Feeney said about the Future of Media Commission and its awaited report. I will say no more about those aspects but I acknowledge and welcome what Mr. Feeney has said. Turning to Mr. Feeney's opening statement, I note that his office was established in 2008. As a new Member of the House, certainly a new member of this committee, I welcome the fact that he is before us today. How many complaints, on average, has his office dealt with year on year? I know he will not go into any specifics, but what is the general figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Feeney for that comprehensive response. I know the Chair will tell me when I am out of time. I will come back in latter with further questions. Delving into the average of 400 complaints the Press Council receives per year, some of which, as Mr. Feeney says, are misdirected, does he have a percentage for the number of people who think they are contacting his office correctly but whom he has to redirect? I note he has only two and a half whole-time staff working in his office, which is quite a load for those staff. Can he give us a sense of how many complaints are misdirected?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is interesting.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Feeney referred in his opening statement that the Press Ombudsman unlike the other ombudsman offices is not statute based. Why is this?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Feeney mentioned the Southern Star and regional and local newspapers. All of us on the committee are aware of the lack of local newspapers, particularly from my perspective as a Dubliner. Only two remain in the city. I often think of the advertising revenue. Mr. Feeney said 85% of advertising revenue now goes to online platforms. Of course this presents challenges for local newspapers. I am not sure how we can get around this. As people have said, it is about targeting the message to individuals. Campaigns have moved very much online. I was struck by a comment Mr. Feeney made at the end of his opening statement about the complaints he received. Complaints were about articles and not general claims about the press. The time limit of three months is quite short. Does this include appealing it to the Press Council? Does the three months cover the whole time period?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I was going to ask a question about the right to be forgotten legislation. Much has been said about it. Certain individuals and certain organisations want articles and pieces about them to be forgotten. It surprises me Mr. Feeney is giving out the information if the complaint is about something that was written more than three months previously. Does Mr. Feeney think the right to be forgotten legislation needs to be tailored to certain types of articles rather than the way it appears to cover everything?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree with Mr. Feeney, and I hope we can have another discussion in the short term on this, that there is a balance to be struck. Unfortunately there are individuals who are availing of it whom we should not be forgetting about at all. Just because they do not have a conviction it does not mean they should be forgotten. I thank Mr. Feeney for his time today.
