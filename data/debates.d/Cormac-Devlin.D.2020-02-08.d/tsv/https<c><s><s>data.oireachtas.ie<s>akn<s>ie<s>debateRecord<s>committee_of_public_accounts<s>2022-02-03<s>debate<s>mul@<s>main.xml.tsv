CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our guests. I do not intend to go over some of the questions that have already been asked. I agree with the comments Deputy McAuliffe made about the perception of delays in the MetroLink project and what that means for its delivery. I remember a lot of publicity about the Metro green line. I also remember going to various public consultations. Can our guests tell us how much has been spent to date on that public consultation? How detailed were the plans in the end?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fair enough. Mr. Walsh might come back to us with a note on that. I would like to know the cost expended in recent years on that particular proposal. Is there a timeframe for the extension of the existing green line Luas to Fassaroe or Shankill We know the line will run south although we are unsure of where it will ultimately go. Is there a timeframe for when that will be decided and constructed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. There are passenger figures for the Luas on the TII website for 2004 to 2014 but the figures have not been updated since. Our guests might send the committee a note on that point because I would be interested about the capacity of the Luas and the numbers of passengers as we exit the pandemic compared to the numbers pre-pandemic. Some people may have got used to trams being less packed. We need to ensure we have the correct capacity. The passenger numbers would help so Mr. Walsh might send those on. I have a number of questions about the national road network. Mr. Walsh mentioned motorway service areas. I note the M1, M6, M9 and M11 are included. There are 25-year leases or contracts associated with those. As I understand it, they will come back to Transport Infrastructure Ireland and will be subcontracted out again. What plans are there for further service stations or service areas along the motorway network?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We might come back to that point. I would argue there are gaps in the network which is a cause of concern for people who travel. In the same vein, there are issues around charging points for electric vehicles. These all feed into a common and recurring theme, which is that people need those service areas. I have another question about rest stops and lay-bys, which came to me via a constituent. I ask our guests to review the safety of those lay-bys. That is a concern, particularly from a female perspective. The complaint made by my constituent was that she would not use lay-bys, even if she had to, because they are isolated and dark. There is no lighting, public toilet facilities or even something as practical as a tyre pump. Nothing is provided in those lay-bys and I ask our guests to review that as a matter of urgency. A landline telephone would also be useful. I am talking about the practical necessities for people who might be travelling on their own, who may be vulnerable and need those lay-bys. They are well placed but there is nothing in them. We need to examine that. I note that fines and evasions of the M50 tolls are mentioned in the report. I thank our guest for that documentation. How many evasions or non-payments of tolls have there been for the M50, in particular, over the past three or four years? Do our guests have those figures to hand?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fair enough. Mr. Masterson can send that information in a note to the committee. Does the money for fines go to TII, the Department or the private entity, the operator?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Masterson might send on those numbers in a note. I noted that TII's legal fees have doubled since 2018. The figures I have are €1.7 million for 2019 and €2.5 million for 2020. What was the reason for the increase in legal costs?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is for legal fees, is it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Consultancy fees have also increased. Is that for the same reason?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That illustrates Deputy McAuliffe's point about it being under way. I noted TII receives a quarterly report on road traffic collisions and fatalities. TII meets with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the Garda. How frequently does TII meet with the Garda and the RSA? In their documentation, our guests referred to high collision locations. How are they dealt with and how fast are they dealt with?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Keeping with security, I notice that TII has provision for security on the Luas line. That is under its remit. I raised this with the NTA last week. We are aware of incidents on the Luas. While there is good security, they do not have powers of arrest or detention. The engagement that Mr. Walsh spoke about with the gardaí is important. I would argue that there is a need for a dedicated Garda transport unit covering all sorts of transport, including bus, Luas and rail. Has TII had any discussions with An Garda Síochána around deploying gardaí on the Luas, for example?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would ask TII to continue that dialogue. It is important that we see a change in policy there.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On national roads, is the N11-M11 upgrade being done through TII?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Walsh the timeframe or a cost on that? I know there is a preferred route.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Walsh might send a note on that, please. The second option is the route and upgrade of N11-M11 junction.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, I know that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, I would like an update on its current status.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the Luas, I noticed there were 34 trams purchased at a cost of €22 million, although I do not know in which year. I know there are further trams due. I think they have been ordered, if I am not mistaken.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there sufficient capacity, then, for a return to pre-pandemic levels on the Luas system?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There are a number of issues in relation to the TII website. I ask the witnesses to look at that because there is some incorrect data on it. In the time remaining to me, with regard to the internal financial controls, I commend TII on alerting us to the issue with the contract for technical design services and non-procurement. I think the Comptroller and Auditor General referenced that in his opening statement. That should be acknowledged. The internal systems are working, it would appear. On Project BRUCE, better road user charging evaluation, I ask the TII to send a further note on that. On the board, the TII has responsibility for by-laws for toll schemes and a rail system. When was the last time those by-laws were reviewed? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was not in Mr. Walsh’s time anyway.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Walsh might come back to us with a note on those two issues.
