CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My question is similar to Deputy Carthy's on the transfer of information and any subsequent questions this committee or another body may have after the winding-up of Caranua. I have a few points to raise. One is about the date on which Caranua is to appear before the committee. With regard to our earlier conversation about the national children's hospital, there is a date earlier in December we might utilise. I note that, in its correspondence, Caranua says that all survivors' applications will be completed by 11 December. Depending on when the legislation the Comptroller and Auditor General has mentioned, which is required to wind up Caranua, is to be enacted, we may need to get the organisation in as quickly as possible. The Comptroller and Auditor General may be able to answer a question for me. There is an estimated operational wind-down cost of â‚¬300,000 as of the end of October. Is there anything to suggest that cost would increase given that it is now to wind down at the end of the year? Is he familiar with that matter?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fair enough. I suggest that we use that date in early December, if it is available, to bring in Caranua.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If we put school transport on our work programme, what happens to the correspondence? Do we note it and it gets published? What do we do in that instance?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Can we hold it off until the next meeting?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On that point, can we go back to the proposals for 9 December? Noting what the Comptroller and Auditor General has just said about Vote 21 and chapter 7 being taken together, presumably, Vote 24 would be taken on the Wednesday and we would deal with the other element of that on the Thursday. Can the Chairman clarify for me if the Department of Justice will be in attendance for both days, as well as the Irish Prison Service? I am conscious that there will be a cross-over in terms of some questions. We do not want to have to say at that meeting that a particular question was for yesterday's session and that today's session is only questions for the Irish Prison Service. We need to be careful of that with the new format we are proposing. As long as both agencies will be present-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, but there may be other examples where we may need to be conscious of that format.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. It works.
