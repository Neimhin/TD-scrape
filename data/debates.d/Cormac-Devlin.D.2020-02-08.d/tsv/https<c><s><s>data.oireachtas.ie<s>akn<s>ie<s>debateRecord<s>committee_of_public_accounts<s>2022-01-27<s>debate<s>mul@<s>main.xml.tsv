CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their attendance. It is good to have the engagement today. My colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, had requested an engagement with the NTA specifically on MetroLink. As he will engage on that in a little while, I will not refer to it myself. I welcome the fact that the NTA has given us an update on the DART+ coastal south as well as the DART+ tunnel and the underground. On the DART+ coastal, I understand that Merrion Gates was mentioned. The NTA previously put forward a plan on that. I note in the update that the NTA is revising the plan. Does the plan include the flyover opposite St. Vincent's church? Is that still the same idea? What is the thinking around the closure of the Merrion Gates? Could the witnesses share that with us at this point?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that there are limited options.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. I know it is at an early stage. I welcome the update on BusConnects, albeit limited. There are several other routes and the network of spines to be rolled out. I would welcome an update on when routes 13 and 15 are proposed to be implemented and, equally, some information on the E spine. In the documentation provided to the committee it was mentioned that a total of 12 applications will be made for core bus corridors. However, my understanding is that there were 16 corridors in the initial consultation. Where have the other four gone or have they been amalgamated?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is the route 13. In effect, 15 has become 13.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Creegan for that clarity. I will turn to more localised issues in terms of the complaints procedure. Probably all Deputies on this committee are aware that there is quite a volume of complaints specifically about some of the private operators. In my case, the issue relates to Go-Ahead. I am aware of relentless and continuous complaints about bus services, between cancellations, late arrivals, and buses disappearing from schedules. It is really unacceptable. People cannot rely on the services, specifically the routes 17, 63, and 175. This is not isolated. This is practically daily. The response from the NTA has been quite poor. If I am being honest, I think that the response should have been more robust, because as Ms Graham said to previous Deputies about the PSO, there is an agreement in place and the contractors are meant to be adhering to what they say and that is not being done. What else can we see from the NTA in terms of improvements to those services?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will just cut across Mr. Gaston there. I am sorry, but this is not isolated to Covid. This is pre-Covid and it has continued. I am familiar with the 63 route. We could take this offline, but I can send Mr. Gaston a slew of complaints I have received specifically in respect of that route. The reason I raise the matter is because I and my constituents have constantly been sent the same response to our correspondence with the NTA. It is just not acceptable.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	But it has a lot fewer routes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am sorry, but I have limited time on this. I just want to say to Mr. Gaston that this is not due to traffic, because the bus never appears. The bus is not in traffic. The bus never runs. The 7.15 bus on the 63 route does not appear. I have corresponded with the NTA and the response is not good. The response to constituents is even worse. At times, they do not get responses. I am just asking the NTA to have a look at Go-Ahead's 63 route. It is not acceptable. It is not working. People cannot get to work. The second issue I wish to raise is the service for students going to school. We have three routes locally â€“ the 111, 59, 75 and at times the 75A. Could we look at synchronising those to service the students who are going to the educational facilities that ultimately those routes serve, be it going to school or coming home from school? Again, we have corresponded with the NTA. It is our only opportunity to engage on this. I ask the NTA to look at the timetable again, specifically in the afternoon for the 111 and the 59, because there are two or three primary and secondary schools that could avail of the service if it were a few minutes later. I ask the NTA to do that. In terms of the overall complaints, the NTA's report did not cover it, but Ms Graham touched on it earlier. Could the NTA please send a note to the committee on the volume of complaints, broken down by type of service, be it bus, rail or whatever? That will be of interest to me and it is something we need to be aware of. Does Ms Graham have any information on that right now?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Could Ms Graham give a flavour of what kind of numbers we are talking about?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Ms Graham have actual figures? Are there numbers?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That seems-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask Ms Graham to furnish the information to the committee, perhaps with actual numbers. I appreciate they are calculated per 100,000. It would be good to get the raw numbers. Several internal reviews were done and with the exception of July 2020 when it was done by McCann FitzGerald and November 2021 when it was done by KPMG, a total of 19 other internal reports were conducted by RSM. Is there a particular reason one company does the vast majority of the internal reviews?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	By the Department?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	By the NTA.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In the few minutes I have, I wish to raise two issues. One concerns security. My colleague mentioned the fear, particularly of women, on public transport, but it also applies to teenagers, the elderly and other users of public transport services. I am aware that there are private security firms, which I understand are hired by the operators, if I am not mistaken. As the transport authority for the country, what is the NTA's view on proper security? I am not a fan of security. I prefer a Garda presence but that is beyond all of our powers here. I would like to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on the matter as representatives of the NTA.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is it a requirement that the operators have to pay for that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Gaston for the response. The feedback I get is that the platform is not the most dangerous part. It is when they are on the actual transport facility, whether that is a bus, DART or a Luas. On a bus, the emphasis is on the driver to monitor what is happening on board, as well as maintaining safety on the road. I believe there needs to be a dedicated Garda unit to this, whereby its members can hop on or hop off all various types of transport. Has the NTA has engaged with the Garda on that? I hear what Mr. Gaston is saying about the good response times and the good response generally. However, I would like to know that the NTA is pushing for this. Finally, in my last few moments, I ask the Department about the taxi advisory committee. Has that been fully appointed now? Are all the nominees on it? Is it meeting?
