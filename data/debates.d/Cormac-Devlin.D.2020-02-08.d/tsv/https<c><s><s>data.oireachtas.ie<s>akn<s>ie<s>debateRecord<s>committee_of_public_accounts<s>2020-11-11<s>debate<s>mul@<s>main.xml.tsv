CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Buckley and his colleagues. I thank them for their opening remarks and for all of their work on our important national monuments, public parks and State buildings. I thank Mr. Buckley and his colleagues for a recent update vis-à-vis a parliamentary question which I raised in July about Tully Church and the monuments surrounding it. I thank the witnesses for that briefing and for the commitment of those actively involved with the Tully site in the Cherrywood strategic development zone. The witnesses might pass on my appreciation to the officials concerned, particularly those on the ground. I have some questions relating to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the witnesses' opening remarks. The OPW leases the office premises in Miesian Plaza on Baggot Street, mainly to accommodate the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. That contracted annual rent is approximately €10 million and the total commitment is €231.7 million over 25 years. It is reported that there has been an overpayment in the region of €10 million to the landlord. I know there has been ongoing correspondence between the OPW and the landlord. Will the witnesses provide this committee with an update on the lease and what engagement they have had with the landlord since their appearance at the Committee of Public Accounts in October 2018?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Obviously €10 million is a lot of money and there is significant concern. I read the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2017 and I understand the issues with the international property measurement standards, IPMS, and the difference of measurement which caused the problem. Nonetheless, the Exchequer is out to the tune of €10 million. Hopefully that will be resolved soon. Will the witnesses keep the committee apprised of developments? I turn to subhead B.7, for property maintenance which is approximately €64.7 million, an increase of €4 million from 2018, when it was €60.7 million. I am harking back quite a bit, to 2013, but the question relates to the current day. Some 100 Garda stations were closed between 2012 and 2013. Are all of those stations still under the control of the OPW?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Bourke might also tell us how many of those 100 have been sold. How many have been repurposed or are still under the OPW's control and effectively vacant?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Bourke have the cost of the ongoing maintenance of the stations still in the control of the OPW? I think a cost was given in my constituency. The cost for the maintenance of the Garda station in Dalkey was €40,796 since it was closed in 2012. Does that include the security contract for that station and similar stations?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Bourke's comments about 12 being in use for serving or retired members of An Garda Síochána. Maybe that could be considered for those remaining in OPW control. I turn to office accommodation. The OPW has a substantial portfolio of accommodation, with total leasing commitments for 2019 of €113 million. What is the total area of the office accommodation portfolio and how much is inactive at present? I note from the report that it is about 1% here in Ireland but it is up to 11% for European counterparts. Is that still the current status?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What about post Covid?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I presume the OPW is examining, on an ongoing basis, the State's portfolio. Is there a strategy to manage it post Covid? We do not know the impact. A major bank gave an indication today about its use of office space. There will be a knock-on effect from remote working. Is that actively under consideration by the OPW?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have a question on the figures given by Mr. Martin Bourke. Does the OPW have a general ratio between Dublin and outside of Dublin in terms of office space? Is there a breakdown of that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is a key question for the post-Covid period. Could the State be left with a considerable excess of office space post-pandemic? Is there a strategy to deal with that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to return to the Garda element of the portfolio. I note the lease will expire for Garda headquarters on Harcourt Street in 2022.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, it is Harcourt Square. How long is that lease for? What is the cost per annum?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I assumed from the report that it was in the ownership of the State. I would hope, given the new lease options post-2022, that would be something we could explore. It is a colossal amount of money. I agree that it is a strategic building and it is important in size, but surely the State could explore that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Bourke might come back to me on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, I will turn to flood alleviation. The OPW officials have given a good deal of information in the opening remarks. I understand the expenditure prior to 2015 was €412 million. Am I correct in saying that from 2015 to 2019 the expenditure was €268 million? What was the reason for the difference? I would have thought expenditure was ramping up at that point.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is a cumulative figure. Is that right?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That makes more sense. A study of 300 communities has been taking place across Ireland and 80% of the studies have been completed. What is the status of the remaining 20%? A total of 11 major flood relief schemes have commenced and seven more are due to commence shortly. Can the OPW give an indication of when those seven will be commenced? What stage are they at? If the officials do not have the information today, they might come back to me on it. I have a question specifically around the Deansgrange flood relief scheme. It is of particular interest to me.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My thanks to the officials.
