CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses. To refer back to the opening statement of the Comptroller and Auditor General, he issued a clear audit opinion for the 2021 accounts but drew attention to:... a note in the account that discloses payment of a fine to the European Commission arising from a judgement [relating to Derrybrien in Galway] of the European Court of Justice in November 2019. The case concerned Ireland’s failure to ensure that a retrospective environmental impact assessment was carried out in respect of a wind farm constructed in County Galway. The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that a lump sum of €5 million was paid in 2020, plus a daily fine of €15,000 and legal costs. At the outset, €15,000 per day is a phenomenal amount of money to be paying. I note the 2022 figures are not included here but I am sure the witnesses have them to hand. To date, how much has been spent on this fine? I ask the witnesses to leave out legal costs for now. We will take that as included. I suspect it is approximately €22 million, or in excess thereof. I ask the witnesses to clarify the position in that regard.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will come back to the decision and the closing off of this terrible saga and the costs incurred by the State. What is the figure for the legal costs from 2019 to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to clarify this. I quoted from his opening statement. There is a reference to legal costs. He might be able to shed------
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask that a note be sent to the committee on that matter.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman. In terms of the conclusion to this, is there-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It would be good to get a global figure for how much this is costing the State. That would be helpful. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is a lump sum.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the conclusion to it, Mr. Doyle referred to a retrospective environmental assessment. Does the Department have a timeframe for when this might be finished, including the daily fines and all the associated costs?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have just four minutes left so I ask Mr Doyle to be brief in his responses. With regard to Uisce Éireann and all the reforms that have taken place there, I am a little taken aback with regard to the separation of the entity itself. It is stated that this will take effect this year, but that is unlikely. The Committee of Public Accounts will obviously have a role in questioning Uisce Éireann on its operations, but that is not likely to happen until 2024. Why will it take so long? If the entity has been established and reformed, why is it taking so long for it to become accountable to this committee?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We will monitor the situation. I want to turn to the local property tax. There have obviously been changes to the bands in the last year or so. In terms of the amounts collected, has the Department seen a drop-off in the payments being made by householders in local property tax globally across the country or have more people availed of the monthly payment scheme?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is the Revenue Commissioners who ultimately obtain all of that information. That clarifies the position. The staffing complement of the Department was 1,207 in 2020. This increased by 159, to 1,366, in 2021. What kind of grades and areas have the new staff been deployed in? Are they at administrative officer or principal officer, PO, level or above?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	However, the 159 are brand-new staff.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Department might forward a note to the committee with a breakdown of that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Since I am on the topic of staffing, there was a story in the Sunday newspapers relating to the Secretary General. There was quite extensive coverage about an issue involving him being in negotiations in respect of his salary. Is there any way he can shed light on that issue here?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is no change at present from what is listed here in this documentation in terms of salary.
