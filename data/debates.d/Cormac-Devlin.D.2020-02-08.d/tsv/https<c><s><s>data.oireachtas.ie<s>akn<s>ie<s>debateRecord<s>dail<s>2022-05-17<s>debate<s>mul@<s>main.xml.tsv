CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Taoiseach will be aware that medical scientists in many HSE hospitals are due to strike tomorrow, which will have implications for patients and hospitals alike. Medical scientists provide 24-7 services in hospitals, and most of them have a science degree or a master's qualification. The action is in frustration over long-running pay and career development issues that are affecting recruitment and retention in the sector. The medical scientists will of course provide emergency cover, but elective surgeries will likely be impacted. Many of these patients have been waiting years for surgery.One multiple sclerosis patient who is attending the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh is terrified that he will lose a hip replacement appointment for tomorrow. I ask the Taoiseach to raise this issue as a matter of urgency with the Minister for Health, ask for a fair settlement for medical scientists and ensure that any patients who are impacted will have their procedures rescheduled to the earliest possible date.
