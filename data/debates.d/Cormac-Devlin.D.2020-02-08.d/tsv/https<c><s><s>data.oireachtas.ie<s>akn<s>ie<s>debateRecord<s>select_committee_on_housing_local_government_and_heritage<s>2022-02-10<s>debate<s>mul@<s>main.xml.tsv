CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak. I am substituting for a committee member. I have a number of questions on Vote 34 specifically. Some are for the Minister and others for the Minister of State. I note a further €275.8 million in capital has been carried over from 2021. I am assuming that is related to an underspend caused by the pandemic. It is also noted that a little over €92 million will be available from the Local Government Fund. Turning specifically to the €2.53 billion allocated for expenditure, there is, I believe, a figure for programme B, which is water. The Chairman mentioned Arklow but I am also conscious of water quality in Dublin Bay. Irish Water has a particular programme under way for refurbishing and improving treatment plants. Is funding provided for that in programme B, under capital to Irish Water? Programme F deals with conservation. There are various conservation funds, including the historical structures fund, the architectural structures fund and the annual funds administered by the local authorities. Are they included in programme F. Subhead F11 deals with climate adaptation. Is there an increase in funding under that subhead?
