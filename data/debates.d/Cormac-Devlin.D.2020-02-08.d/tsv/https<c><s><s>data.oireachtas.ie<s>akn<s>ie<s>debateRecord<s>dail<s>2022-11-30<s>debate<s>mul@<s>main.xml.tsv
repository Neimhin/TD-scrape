CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Taoiseach will be aware that the Garda and private security organisations have been calling for the introduction of body cameras to improve safety and transparency.The general data protection regulation and other data protection rules, regulations and related guidelines limit or prohibit the use of body cameras. There was some revised guidance from the data protection officer recently. However, uncertainties remain and primary legislation is required. Will the Taoiseach advise as to when he expects Second Stage of the Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) Bill 2022 to be taken? Will he ask the Minister for Justice to examine extending the use of body cameras to private security staff?
