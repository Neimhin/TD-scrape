CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Professor Buckley and Dr. Glynn have made some important points and we have had a good discussion. Professor Buckley touched on offshore wind farms and their appropriate location.I think Professor Buckley mentioned soil types as well. Is she saying onshore or offshore is a more appropriate place for wind farms or is she just highlighting where they are placed, irrespective of whether onshore or offshore? She also referenced the national biodiversity action plan. What are her thoughts on the role, when this Bill is passed, of the local authorities in actioning the national plan and in actions from this Bill? I have two questions for Dr. Glynn pertaining to his opening remarks and the recommendations he made. He highlighted Irish territorial waters in the definition of "sink". Will he elaborate on that point? He acknowledged the role of early dialogue and societal buy-in. I think that is crucial in anything we do. He said behavioural change and demand reduction will be required and the national objective is unlikely to be met by technological means alone. Will he expand on that point?
