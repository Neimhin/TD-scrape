CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our witnesses. I thank them for their presentation and the slides they provided in advance of today's meeting. I have a few questions on foot of that. Based on when SBCI was initially established I understand that a loss of more than €5.2 million has been incurred up to 2019. Is there a bad debt provision for the SBCI and if not, why not?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is not going to happen.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand what Mr. Black is saying about the establishment costs but the ongoing expenses for SBCI, in terms of premises, financial management, procurement, HR and administration, are all linked with the NTMA. Surely the costs being incurred are quite minimal unless the SBCI is being billed for those pro rata. In his opening remarks, Mr. Black mentioned he used intermediaries to get lending out to market but I note that the SBCI also spent €1 million on advertising. Given the link between the intermediaries and their promotion of the SBCI, why is there a need to spend so much money?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Those establishment costs, given the connection to the NTMA, are surely not that much, are they?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How long can an entity, be it an SME in Ireland or a subsidiary from another jurisdiction, be established before it can apply and approach SBCI for funding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	An Irish SME or maybe a subsidiary from another jurisdiction but for all intents and purposes it is an Irish SME. How long does it have to be established before it can approach the SBCI for funding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What makes them eligible? Do they have to be trading for two years, one year or five months? Are there criteria there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is no requirement on trading time, is there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Sweeney and Mr. Black.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chair for allowing be back in. I wish to ask Mr. Black and his colleagues about the strategic review. How is it proceeding and what elements of it is the SBCI proceeding with in 2021? That is my first question. I will ask my second question if there is time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Were any internal recommendations made about processes within the organisation and how clients and portfolios are handled?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On internal controls, for instance, I note that the SBCI has an audit and risk committee, a credit committee, a remuneration committee, and others. Without having to name members, what organisations are represented on those committees to ensure proper oversight?
