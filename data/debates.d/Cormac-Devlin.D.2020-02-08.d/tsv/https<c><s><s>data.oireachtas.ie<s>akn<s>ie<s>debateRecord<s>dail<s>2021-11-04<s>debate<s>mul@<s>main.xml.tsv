CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know it is not the Minister's remit, but he will be aware of recent reports of antisocial and criminal behaviour on our public transport services, be they Luas, DART or bus services throughout the greater Dublin area. Only yesterday, in the Irish Independent, Allison Bray reported on antisocial behaviour and harassment that seems to have become endemic on services. The response from Irish Rail security was that nothing can be done and they see it every day. That is an appalling indictment of our public transport services. Passengers and staff deserve to be safe on these services. When will the Government introduce a dedicated Garda transport unit?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wholeheartedly agree with my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, on his remarks on the Bill, including the assumption of the challenges not only facing us here in Ireland but right across Europe. A higher level must be achieved. I thank the Minister of State for his attendance throughout this discussion this afternoon of this important Criminal Justice (Smuggling of Persons) Bill 2021. I support this Bill, which provides for the implementation of three international legal instruments in the area of people smuggling. These three instruments are aimed at providing an effective international response to the growing problem of people smuggling. Under these instruments, any person who deliberately assists unauthorised entry, transit or residence of a non-EU national in the EU is to be sanctioned unless doing so for humanitarian reasons. It is an important point that the Minister of State made in his opening remarks that there is a safeguard for those who are undertaking that extraordinary work. As noted, people smuggling differs from human trafficking in that trafficking is carried out for the explicit purpose of exploitation and need not necessarily involve illegal entry into a state. People smuggling is not defined in terms of exploitation but the process of people smuggling typically involves serious exploitation, suffering and a risk of physical harm and death. People smuggling frequently involves the imposition of extortionate fees by smugglers, as we heard, as well as exposing the illegal migrants to severe danger in clandestinely entering states. This was demonstrated by the recent tragedy in Britain where 39 people died in a container in Essex and the Wexford tragedy of December 2001, which happened in the Minister of State's constituency. Those images haunt everybody and serve to highlight the challenges faced by those individuals. As my colleague has said, they have paid to get to where they think their destination will be. Members have noted the high estimates of numbers of people smuggled into the State. As a State we should do more to streamline the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, process and systems to help vulnerable people without papers regularise their position. I highlight the remarks from Deputy Howlin earlier about the need for greater co-operation between the INIS and Deputies from across the House, which were well made. In many cases Members of this House are the last option for those individuals, particularly the most vulnerable people. Agencies should not be using the General Data Protection Regulation and other regulations as a pretext for avoiding transparency and accountability. Personally, I have found INIS officials very helpful but it is clear the office is stretched and requires greater resources and support. Perhaps this is something the Minister of State can raise with colleagues in advance of the next budget. That said, this is very worthwhile and needed legislation. It is important that Europe is working collectively on it. Much more needs to be done. The Minister of State and the Ceann Comhairle are aware that on 19 October I restored the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2018 to the Order Paper. That deals with people leaving this jurisdiction for other reasons but such matters must be viewed in the round. Any effort in this space by the State must be welcomed and we must do more in this space to protect vulnerable individuals. As we have said, they believe they are heading to a better destination or life but are confronted with some pretty horrific reality. They feel they cannot do anything about it. We need to hear more about the Health Service Executive anti-human trafficking team and promote it as our existing services need greater support and promotion. That is so people who feel exploited and vulnerable can report their position and, we hope, get the support and assistance they need and deserve.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the report, Monitoring Adequate Housing in Ireland, and to discuss the significant progress made to date on the serious issues highlighted within it. I note the Minister of State's remarks in that regard. The research, published jointly by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Economic and Social Research Institute, has shown that lone parents and their children account for 53% of homeless families and are much more likely to experience inadequate housing than other household types. The report also highlights the disadvantage experienced by young people, migrants, people with disabilities, Travellers and others in the Irish housing system. While I note the reductions in homelessness in recent months, the recent increase in the homeless figures will be of serious concern to the Government. Significant improvements have been made since homelessness was at its highest two years ago but a huge amount of work remains to be done and we recognise that. Budget 2022 allocated €194 million to homeless services and the Government is committed to ending homelessness by 2030. The Government’s focus on increasing housing supply was evident in budget 2022. Next year, for example, €4 billion of Exchequer funding, supplemented by Land Development Agency funding and Housing Finance Agency lending, will be made available to deliver 9,000 new build social homes and make 4,130 homes available for affordable purchase and cost rental. In my constituency of Dún Laoghaire, a significant public housing development has been completed at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside. The scheme includes cost-rental and social housing units. A total of 597 badly needed homes will be constructed at the former Shanganagh Castle site in Shankill. This public housing scheme, which is being developed in partnership between the Land Development Agency and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, will deliver 91 affordable purchase homes, 306 cost-rental units and 200 social homes. Cost-rental homes are a new form of renting and will result in more affordable rents for households which struggle to pay private rents but earn above the threshold for social housing. The new Shanganagh development is currently the country’s largest proposed cost-rental scheme. These new homes will include 51 terraced, semi-detached and detached houses and 546 apartments. They will be a mix of two four-bedroom, 99 three-bedroom, 302 two-bedroom and 165 one-bedroom units and 29 studio apartments. The Minister is committed to progressing this and other badly needed public housing schemes and I look forward to working with him and his officials to increase the supply of public and private housing. I welcome today’s announcement on private rents in Dublin. It will come as a relief to renters. However, there are issues around securing a home to rent. Higher costs remain and will be resolved by an increase in supply. I welcome the measures in Housing for All in this regard, particularly the zoned site tax, which will penalise property owners who sit on zoned serviced land. The report we are discussing, which is welcome, raises the challenges encountered by people with disabilities in securing appropriate accommodation. It found that 29% of persons living with a disability experience housing quality issues, when compared with those without a disability. People with disabilities are also more likely to report an inability to keep their home warm and arrears on rent or mortgage payments. All Members of this House will be aware of the challenges faced by people with disabilities when trying to secure social or private housing. This issue needs to be addressed and I will continue to work on it with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Ministers responsible for disability. Housing policy must address the needs of our society, particularly its most vulnerable members. The restricted options for older people and people with disabilities are among the most pressing issues. I welcome the pathways detailed in the Housing for All strategy to support these vulnerable groups and others. I also welcome the commitment to publishing a new national housing strategy for people with disabilities and I look forward to working with the Minister of State and Members across the House.
