CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will the Minister of State provide an update on the engagement between officials in his Department and the OPW and relevant stakeholders on the Cherrywood strategic development zone, SDZ, particularly since January 2018? As he will be aware, I have raised this issue previously. It is very important not only to the constituency of Dún Laoghaire but to the State overall.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State. I raised this issue in July. There was a changeover in the Minister of State's Department at the time. There has been a much clearer response this evening, which I welcome. My main concern is the overall development of the 360 ha SDZ, which is one of the largest in the State. The Minister of State referenced Tully church and the other nearby monuments. Because of the rich history and the artefacts in the area, chapter 8 of the SDZ plan is of paramount importance in the developer's work all around that site. It is important that the Minister of State's Department continues that good dialogue with the developer and with all stakeholders, including Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to safeguard those artefacts and ensure that when the development is complete they are protected as much as possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State. I want to put on record my appreciation for the work of the officials since July. I know that other meetings have taken place, more than likely virtually, but nonetheless there is good engagement on this site. The chairman of the OPW and others appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts last week. I thank them for their engagement. Given the historic nature of the Tully church and its surrounds, it is important that we get this right and that we afford those protections. Going forward, between now and when development is complete, the Minister of State might keep me informed of plans during and post-construction. If there is a site visit, I would be more than willing to participate.
