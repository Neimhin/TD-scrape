CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Taoiseach will be aware of the case of Bernard Phelan, an Irish citizen imprisoned in Iran. Bernard was born in Clonmel and raised in Blackrock, in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire. He was arrested on 3 October last year and is one of a number of European citizens being held in Iran. I understand that Bernard has cardiac and other medical conditions. His elderly father and his family are extremely concerned for his health and well-being. I have raised this matter with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs but I would be grateful if the Taoiseach could raise it directly with President Ebrahim Raisi.
