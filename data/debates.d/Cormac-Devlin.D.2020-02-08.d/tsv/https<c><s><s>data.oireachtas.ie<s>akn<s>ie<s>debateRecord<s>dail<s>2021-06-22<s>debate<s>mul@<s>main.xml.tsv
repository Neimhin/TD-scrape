CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply to that question. Are there any plans to develop a national security strategy? The previous Government went to develop a national security strategy in 2019, with the process led by the national security analysis centre. I understand there was also a short consultation process undertaken at that time, over three weeks which included Christmas holidays. Were the results of that consultation ever published? I note what the Taoiseach said on the confidentiality around this committee and I appreciate that. However, if there is an intention to publish the results of the consultation, can the Taoiseach outline that to us? With regard to the recent cyberattack on both on the HSE and the Department of Health, which the Taoiseach referred to in his response and which obviously caused huge disruption right across the health system, has this National Security Committee met since that attack? Given the impact of that cyberattack, does the Taoiseach believe a general review of the State's cyber and general security apparatus should be undertaken?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On behalf of Deputy Lawless, I thank the Taoiseach for his response regarding the national risk assessment. The assessment began in 2014, there was another in 2019 and the most recent one was deferred. From my assessment, I understand that the level of spending in Ireland on defence in 2019 was 0.2% of GDP. By my calculations, that is far too low, even by the standards of any comparable neutral country. In a recent budget there was a bigger annual increase for the military pensions than there was for day-to-day defence expenditure. Could the Taoiseach have this examined, perhaps by reference to other similar neutral countries for instance, Finland, Sweden and Austria? It is an important issue and we need to take account of it. Given that the assessment has not been done yet, as we are going to head into a new cycle it is important that we go in with a view to spending more to ensure the outcome is better.
