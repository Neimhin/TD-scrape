CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand that 450 new staff will be employed in the Passport Office. I acknowledge the work of the staff in that office. It has been an extremely busy time for them, particularly in the last number of months. Some were re-tasked to assist the Department of Social Protection and other Departments during the height of the pandemic. I am sure I speak for all Deputies when I express gratitude for the work they have done and for assisting many members of the public. The Minister will be aware of the backlog of paper-based applications and of more complex applications. Indeed, there is a heap of applications by parents for children's first passports that need to be dealt with.When does the Minister expect those new staff to come on stream? How long will it take to process the backlog, particularly, of paper-based applications? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is important that this House discuss the findings of the Farrelly commission's inquiry into the Grace case. Grace was failed by the State and her service providers. Concerns were raised as far back as 1993. Grace and her family deserve the truth and the establishment of the full facts of the case. The commission, under chairperson and sole member Marjorie Farrelly, SC, commenced its investigation on 15 May 2017. Four years on, it is regrettable that we do not have a final report. My colleague, Deputy McGuinness, has consistently raised this in the House. I commend him on his tenacity in this regard. It is important for this House to see the final report. Under the terms of reference, as approved by the Government in March 2017, a final report on the commission's phase 1 work into Grace's case was due to be submitted to the Minister for Health within one year of the commission commencing its work. The commission has received a number of time extensions to enable it to carry out its work in accordance with the terms of reference. The pandemic will have had an impact on the work of the commission. That is understandable. In the circumstances, I support the extension for another 12 months so the commission may continue with its work but I would like to see the final report on Grace's case. The interim findings of the commission are a matter of deep concern as it is clear that, at the time in question, the South-Eastern Health Board, and subsequently the HSE, failed to adhere to their statutory obligations. These reports point to a series of historic systemic failings on the part of the various public bodies. It should be acknowledged that the national policy on the care of children and adults with intellectual disabilities has developed significantly since the periods covered by the reports, including through the establishment of the national safeguarding policy and the safeguarding committee in each of the community healthcare organisations, the appointment of a confidential recipient, and the establishment of a national independent review panel. However, as we have seen in the Brandon report, Grace's case may not be an isolated incident. There may be more systemic failures. The needs of service users must be prioritised, and lessons must be learned. A start would be the full publication of the Brandon report, as called for by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on several occasions. Last month, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State responsible for disabilities published two substantive interim reports of the commission of investigation. The first covers the period from 1989 to 1996, when Grace reached adulthood. It covers the role of public authorities in her care and protection and the arrangements whereby her foster home was identified. The second report covers the period from 1997 to 2007. The commission has found that there were repeated and systemic failings in the management of the care of Grace, an intellectually disabled woman left in foster care for two decades despite concerns about physical and sexual abuse. As an infant, Grace was given into the voluntary care of the State. She lived in several residential and foster home settings within the Eastern Health Board area up to the age of 11. She was then placed in the foster care of family X by the South-Eastern Health Board in February 1989. This was in a home in the south east. She lived with family X into adulthood, or until she was nearly 31 years of age, which was almost for 20 years. The commission found that Grace was placed in foster care along with other vulnerable adults and children despite her foster parents – identified only as "Mr. and Mrs. X" – having criminal convictions. The investigation could not conclude whether Mr. X's convictions for larceny and theft, dating from 1966, and Mrs X's convictions for larceny in 1988 would have prevented them from being approved as foster parents for Grace in 1989, "but considers that it is unlikely to have done so". This is extraordinary. The HSE was unable to tell the commission whether there was a policy within the South-Eastern Health Board in or around 1989 that would have prohibited children from being placed in the care of individuals against whom there were criminal convictions. Grace remained in the family's care until 2009 despite allegations of abuse. The commission found that, in the care and decision-making in Grace's case from 1997 to 2006, there were:– [an] ongoing lack of clarity about Grace's legal status as a vulnerable adult; – misconceptions about the role and legal status of Mrs. and Mr. X and Grace's mother with respect to decision making for Grace; – ongoing confusion/misunderstanding about what had occurred in Grace's case in 1996; – ongoing failure to seek legal advice or to follow through on the issue of wardship; – inconsistent approach to monitoring; – failures in information sharing and working with incomplete information; – absence of proper supervision and oversight; – paralysis around interconnection between care decisions and legal considerations; – lack of co-ordination and follow through; and – delay, indecision and U-turns.Failings in Grace's care and overarching systemic issues affecting her case "resulted in her case disappearing from view within the health board" from when she was 18 until she was 28. That sends a chill down our spines and those of parents or others who look to the State for care. We saw a programme some days ago on historical failings in this State but the case we are talking about arose during my lifetime, not decades ago. The commission stated that the reactive, rather than proactive, manner in which the disability service operated, together with the absence of oversight and regular file reviews, "contributed to Grace's case falling through the cracks and out of sight in 2001". The commission has found that the South-Eastern Health Board and its officials were the decision-makers. It is clear they failed in their responsibility to Grace, and possibly other vulnerable individuals under their care. Grace has been failed by the South-Eastern Health Board and State. She and her family must receive justice. Lessons must be learned and all vulnerable people must be protected in the future. I look forward to examining the final report of the commission.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021, a wide-ranging Bill that seeks to regulate e-scooters, e-bikes and the newly installed dynamic traffic management system on the M50. The Bill also includes measures to increase the speed of the implementation of BusConnects and underpins the investment in a much-improved public transport system. Significantly, the Bill also introduces legislation to deal with dangerous and antisocial off-road use of scramblers, quads and similar vehicles. There are amendments to strengthen laws concerning insurance and road traffic law enforcement. These measures will help to improve road safety while helping us to drive down the cost of insurance for law-abiding drivers. These initiatives will help us to advance towards our ambitious shared EU Vision Zero objective of eliminating deaths and serious injuries on our roads by 2050. While I generally welcome the Bill as part of the Government's efforts to introduce and encourage alternative modes of mobility, give people more options and reduce our reliance on cars, I believe there are issues with it. I hope the Minister will be open to amendments on Committee Stage. I will deal with each of the principal aspects of the Bill in turn. Currently, both e-bikes and e-scooters come under the definition of a mechanically propelled vehicle, MPV. A person driving or riding an MPV must have insurance, tax and a licence. This has caused confusion as there is no specific licence available for an e-scooter or e-bike. Section 16(e) of this Bill amends the 1961 Act and defines a new category of vehicle, the powered personal transporter, PPT, and sets out certain technical details characterising such vehicles. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states, "This vehicle category is intended to encompass a range of small, lightweight micro-mobility vehicles such as e-scooters, electric skateboards, segways, hoverboards, etc. which are not accurately captured within the vehicle categories as set out in the 1961 Act due to technological innovations in the intervening years." Section 16(b)(ii) amends the Road Traffic Act 1961 to exempt PPTs from the definition of an MPV. This means there will be legal clarity meaning PPTs such as e-scooters and e-bikes can be used without the need for registration, tax, licensing and insurance conditions, as are necessary for MPVs. Part 12 also defines an e-bike for the first time in Irish legislation and differentiates between low-powered and high-powered models. Many of the amendments in Part 12 are technical and add the term PPT or PPTs to existing legislation. While e-bikes and e-scooters will not be treated as MPVs, there is still legislation that prohibits drink driving on a bike and speeding and this will extend to PPTs. The Bill clarifies that PPTs are also required to be roadworthy and may be examined by a garda to ensure they do not have a dangerous defect. It will be an offence to supply a powered personal transporter to a person under the age of 16 years. This is somewhat problematic. I hope consideration will be given to reducing the age, perhaps for low-powered PPTs, or restricted-speed models, to allow children over 12 – basically all secondary school children – to use an e-bike to get around. E-bikes are popular in that age category in secondary schools. Section 109A will give the Garda significant powers to crack down on antisocial and reckless criminal behaviour of those using scramblers and quad bikes. Provisional RSA statistics show that, in the period 2014 to 2019, three of the six people who died in Ireland as a result of an incident involving a quad bike or scrambler were aged 18 or under. The RSA statistics also show that, between 2014 and 2019, 60 people were injured in collisions involving a quad bike or scrambler on a public road. Of those killed or injured, 41% were 18 years of age or under. My Fianna Fáil colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, has already dealt with this issue in detail so I do not propose to repeat what was said other than to compliment him and my colleague, Deputy Lahart, for championing this issue in the House.  The new measures will empower gardaí to enter the curtilage of a dwelling, but not a dwelling itself, to seize and remove scramblers used for antisocial activity. This is particularly welcome. Part 4 of the Bill introduces amendments concerning the information that motor insurers must provide to the Motor Insurance Bureau Ireland and the use of this information. Section 56 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 stipulates that every person using an MPV in a public area must have an approved motor insurance policy. This Bill will ensure insurance companies will have to provide details to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland within five working days. This will be useful for gardaí. It should enhance enforcement and drive down the cost of motor insurance for responsible drivers. I note improvements to fixed-charge penalties included in Part 7 of the Bill, which amends the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975 and will treat fixed-charge notices issued by traffic wardens in the same way as those issued by An Garda under Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 2010. This means a person will have another opportunity to pay a fixed penalty, at the point of summons, before the case goes to court for offences specified in the section, such as parking offences. That is particularly welcome because cases in this regard are clogging up our courts. I would say the vast majority of the cases before the District Court concern road traffic offences. The Bill introduces provisions to deal with variable speed limits on the M50, in addition to technical amendments on novice drivers and driving instructors. All are welcome. I hope the Minister will have regard to my suggestion to allow all second level students to use e-bikes and consider points raised by Deputies on e-scooters to ensure there is not a free-for-all. Concern in this regard was the main deterrent to introducing legislation. It might be useful if the committee hears from experts in this area to reach a cross-party consensus. Disability advocates and groups representing older people, for example, have concerns, and they need to be heard. I hope we can amend the existing legislation. I hope we can make progress on this Bill because its provisions are certainly demanded and needed. We need regulation, but the vehicles in question are very popular and people want to see them introduced on our roads.
