CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Cathaoirleach agus an Aire Stáit. I thank him for the run-through of these estimates. I refer to subhead C6 which is the waste management programmes. I see a near doubling of that fund. Will the Minister of State elaborate on what the additional increase is and what it is due to be spent on?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State and I appreciate that. I will explain the reason for the question. The Minister of State will be aware from our constituency of the issue of the north beach in Bray, as indeed will Deputy Whitmore, and the funding that has been required to maintain that particular former landfill site. When she asked her question on landfill remediation it prompted a concern about the waste management programme and what that entailed when I saw an increase. However, if it is a reallocation, that is fine. Let us just hope the funding continues because it is much needed for those sites.
