CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Many of the questions I hoped to raise have been asked at this point. In terms of the accounts we are discussing today, there was non-compliance with procurement rules. Can Mr. Doyle outline how nine contracts totalling over â‚¬500,000 came about and how they were not in compliance?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There was concern regarding the expenditure on flooding. I presume this is the remit of the Office of Public Works, OPW. Is there somebody present who can speak about that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My other question is about local authorities being held accountable for the implementation of the National Oversight and Audit Commission's report. What is being done to make sure local authorities are in compliance with the commission's recommendations?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There have been many questions in respect of HAP and RAS. What has the Department done to try to ensure that landlords who are signed up to HAP with local authorities are registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB? As public representatives, all us know about and have come across issues of low standards of accommodation for tenants. What has the Department done in that regard to try to encourage landlords to register with the RTB?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If issues arise with tenants and the landlord is not registered with the RTB, what protections can be provided by the Department?What can the local authority offer those tenants who are in that particular predicament?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask Mr. Lemass to send on further information.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That will be very helpful.
