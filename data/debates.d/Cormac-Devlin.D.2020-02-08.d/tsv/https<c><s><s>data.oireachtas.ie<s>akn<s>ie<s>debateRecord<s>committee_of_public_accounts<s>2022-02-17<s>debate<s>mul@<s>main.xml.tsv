CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Doyle and his colleagues. It is good to have them here again. I thank them for the briefing material they have supplied. It has proven beneficial. I will focus on the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement initially. The Comptroller and Auditor referred to HAP. Many questions have already been asked this morning about that scheme. The 20% discretion of local authorities was mentioned and is important. From anecdotal evidence, that is the norm rather than the exception, particularly in my area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. Given the property prices in the area, the council needs to rely on that discretion. I heard what was said of the review that is under way on that. That is welcome.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am surprised. I thought it would be higher. I thank Mr. Doyle. My experience chimes with what Deputy Hourigan said in respect of disabilities. I had a case recently involving somebody with a physical disability where the requirement for their accommodation differed from that of an able-bodied person. Therefore, the discretion was not sufficient to secure a property they required. In the review the Department is doing, I ask it to consider that element. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's report found that 28% of HAP tenants were making the top-up payment in the first half of 2019. I do not expect witnesses have the figures today but they might send a note to the committee with figures for 2017 through to 2020 on the top-ups. The examination found the Department did not have information on the proportion of proposed HAP tenancies inspected or the results of those inspections. The Comptroller and Auditor General goes on to say the recommendations have been accepted by the Department and will be implemented, which is welcome. It will be of interest to this committee when that work is compiled. My colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, referenced Housing for All. I note that Mr. Doyle's term runs concurrently with the introduction of that scheme. Mr Doyle's enthusiasm for the scheme and for delivering on housing is welcome and I thank him for that. Since we have dealt with HAP, will Mr. Doyle touch on RAS? Is it intended to continue to fund RAS for the next year or more?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Doyle have a figure on the number of tenancies in the State relating to RAS? If he does not have it to hand, he might send a note to the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In the note he sends on, will Mr. Doyle break it down for the four local authorities in Dublin? I suspect RAS is more prevalent in urban than rural areas, but I await the figures. I turn to the major capital projects mentioned in note 2. It is 2.9.D, pages 18 to 20. There is a reference to 37 housing construction projects funded directly by the Department in 2020, of which projects 28 had expenditure in 2020, totalling €130 million.Is it possible to give us the number and types of units in those 37 schemes, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, please do. That would be helpful.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes please, that would be great. I turn to retrofitting. Since the announcement of the new retrofitting scheme we have all been inundated with queries. I am conscious that some years ago local authorities started retrofitting schemes themselves. There is increased funding for that. My local authority of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown has made great progress on that. Some schemes are more challenging than others. It can depend on if they own the full block etc. Is there a percentage of how many units each local authority has commenced retrofitting on?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Looking at the voids that were done and the extra funding that was given over the last two years, I presume that shallow retrofits are done at that point as well so therefore the numbers are increasing.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, an issue we have dealt with for some time is the domestic violence refuges. I appreciate the comprehensive update on that. I note Tusla being the lead agency under the capital assistance scheme, CAS. I think the review and the interdepartmental working group that was established found there were nine local authority areas without any domestic violence refuge. Acknowledging that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is not the lead Department, are such refuges the priority for funding first and foremost for the foreseeable future?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If we need to send the Department a note on that to give a list of priorities, we can do that. We are all too familiar, unfortunately, with the need and the gaps in the service.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	One of the items I did not touch on earlier was cost rental. The Department is estimating 2,000 new cost rental homes per year until 2030. I noted there were very quick turnarounds on the calls to the AHBs. There was one call on 14 December with a closing date of 5 January but the decision was made very shortly after that on 8 February. That is good because it means that there are quick decisions and turnarounds, and that the money is there. How many sites are currently earmarked across the State for cost rental? How many units are there in total? Do our guests have those figures?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As an AHB identifies a site or a need for cost rental, it can-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is very good.
