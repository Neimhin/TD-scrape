CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have had dealings with this group. A considerable amount of money would possibly be left over, according to this correspondence, whether that proves to be the case or not. I support the call to bring them in. I believe it is important for the committee and particularly for those who are potentially eligible for this fund that we ensure people who apply are in receipt of what they are entitled to. As I said, I have already come across problems myself, and I think it is appropriate to bring them in.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There are two issues. One is the request for the Department to come in, which I support. That is essential. Conflated with that is the Standing Order we have inherited. Perhaps the Chair could see if that could be addressed for the next meeting in private session. Clearly, the Standing Order needs to be tweaked because it does not meet the requirements of the committee. For me, as a new Deputy to this committee, I would certainly hope that we would have a much broader remit but this seems to put shackles on that. Whatever we can do within and recognising the current judgment, we cannot be hamstrung by this. On Deputy MacSharry's point with regard to looking retrospectively at previous accounts only, it does not make sense. If there is something current and in the public interest, we should be able to amend our work programme, bring them in, whoever they are, and ask them the pertinent questions. I do not think we should deviate from that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman.I wish to make two points. This touches on our discussion of Standing Order 218 and its implications. I know that Standing Order 218 is interlinked with Standing Order 93. I would like to direct this question to the Comptroller and Auditor General. Would we be able to bring the new Department with responsibility for further and higher education, research, innovation and science before the committee? There are no previous accounts to look at because it is a brand new Department. What would happen if we were to apply the Kerins ruling to that? Moreover, I recommend including the Property Registration Authority in the work programme as well.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I made a suggestion to another committee I am on. Perhaps this is something for committee Chairs to decide. If the Committee of Public Accounts could hold an online hearing, it would negate the need for the two-hour limit. If members and witnesses were here in the complex, they would be covered by privilege. If witnesses were to join the committee from another room on the Oireachtas campus, a committee room would not have to be available. Perhaps the clerk could see if that is feasible. I am assuming everybody would be on site, including witnesses. If members or witnesses were not on site, they would know that qualified privilege would apply to them. This might allow us to do a lot more work more quickly. Considering the work programme in front of us, we need to be a bit innovative in how we do our own work to ensure we get the maximum amount of time with witnesses over the next several months. Perhaps the Chair could explore that with the clerk on our behalf.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I want to follow on from what Deputy Munster was saying about the two-hour limit. I return to my original point about the online session and I take on board what Deputy Carthy said about the limitations for the Chair and the clerk to the committee. It could be possible, although it is not ideal, but it would allow us to have an extended period where the meeting was chaired from a committee room, for example. Whichever room it was would need to be a little smaller than this room. If the rest of us were online and the witnesses were as well, there could be a short break to change venue and room. Even one of the meeting rooms would be sufficient. I am simplifying it but once one has a computer, and one is on the complex, one could continue to chair that session and we could have a four-hour session. I ask the clerk to the committee and the Chair that we would be as imaginative as possible to ensure we can get as long as possible with as many witnesses as possible.
