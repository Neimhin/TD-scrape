CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their attendance here today and for their remarks. How many people are employed with the local employment service nationally?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Has that increased over the intervening years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Good. On that basis, is that with a view to expanding the local employment service, LES, and winding down JobPath? Are both needed in tandem with each other?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is welcome and I am glad to hear what Mr. McKeon has said about the LES because certainly it has done tremendous work over the years. It has faced many crises and dealt with a large volume of unemployment over many years. With regard to the process in which a jobseeker is referred to the LES or JobPath, how is it decided and who is decided by?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Specifically, is it the same individual in the Department who decides whether I go to JobPath or the local employment service? What are the criteria? I know Mr. McKeon has said it is random but surely there should be some sort of criteria internally, I hope there is, to decide how many people go to one or the other. The reason I ask is because there is obviously a cost. The State is paying for JobPath and, therefore, I presume the Department needs to keep the figures up. Is it true there is a penalty clause if there are not enough clients coming to JobPath? Is there a penalty for the State and the Exchequer if this is the case? Surely with the local employment service there is no such thing. What is the cost the Department faces if a certain number of jobseekers are not referred to JobPath?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	So that I am clear, is Mr. McKeon saying in the first four and a half years of JobPath, the Department had a target to hit as part of the agreement between the Department and JobPath? What was that target? Mr. McKeon said it was exceeded.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If we had not met that figure what would have been the consequence for the Department? Was there a financial clause?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Up to this point there has been a big concern, and Mr. McKeon has put that to rest this morning by telling the committee there will be investment in the local employment service. Until this point, there has been a feeling in the local employment service that perhaps it would be a sacrificial lamb in all of this, and that because of a contract jobseekers were being referred to JobPath rather than the existing employment service. Mr. McKeon said approximately 280,000 jobseekers have been referred to JobPath. How many were referred to the local employment service in the same period?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Considerably fewer.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Going back to my original point about the individuals deciding who goes where, obviously there was a financial incentive for the Department to refer people to JobPath instead of the existing service. Who decides this? What are the criteria they use?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I get that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	From my knowledge, there is certainly capacity in the local employment service and I hope it will be utilised. From the Department's perspective, what is the cost of the referral of a jobseeker to JobPath versus the local employment service? Can it be drilled down to that level?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. McKeon have approximate figures?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Per jobseeker?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McKeon for all that. I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If they could be sent on, I would appreciate it.
