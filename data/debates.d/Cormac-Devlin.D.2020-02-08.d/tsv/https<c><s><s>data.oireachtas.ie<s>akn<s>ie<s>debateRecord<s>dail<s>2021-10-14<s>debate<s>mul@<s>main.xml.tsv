CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to discuss budget 2022. The underlying macroeconomic forecast for next year is positive and the outlook strong. The State expects to take in approximately €94 billion in revenue, which has given the Ministers for Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform scope to invest an extra €4.7 billion in public services. The Government proposes to focus this extra investment in education, health, childcare services, increases to social protection payments and a modest tax package for workers, all of which are welcome. I particularly welcome the investment secured by the Minister for Education. It includes provision for 350 new teachers, which will see the pupil-teacher ratio reduced to 24:1. Funding to hire an additional 980 special education teachers and 1,165 SNAs will make a real difference to children who need that support. The extra €18 million to support DEIS schools, and €4 million to expand the hot school meals programme, shows the focus of this Government on supporting the most disadvantaged. We have all seen the impact of Covid on hospital waiting lists. I welcome the extra €250 million in funding to deal with that issue. Additional funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund is particularly welcome in this regard. Expanding free GP care to children aged under eight will be welcomed by parents and this measure should be expanded as soon as possible. I welcome the extra funding secured by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, particularly for mental health provision, and the moneys secured by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is present, to support disability services. Increases to social protection rates, carer's allowance and pension payments are all welcome. The increase in the fuel allowance is very positive. However, the price of fuel will need to be monitored closely to ensure that payment is sufficient. I would like to an expansion of the fuel allowance scheme, with the introduction of a partial payment for people earning slightly more than the current threshold, particularly pensioners with a modest occupational pension who live alone. Young people will benefit from the 50% discount on public transport, increased SUSI grants and changes to health treatment benefits. The increase in the minimum wage is welcome. I also commend the investment in childcare, as highlighted by my colleagues, Deputy Lahart and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne. The continued investment in the Housing for All programme is welcome. Next year, the State will deliver almost 50% of all new housing, including 9,000 new social homes. Funding for 11,000 grants to adapt homes for older people and people with disabilities is an important commitment in the budget. It was clear that the vacant site levy was not working. The new zoned property tax, which will be administered and collected by Revenue rather than local authorities, is an important change. I expect it will have a significant impact. A rate of 3% is a good start but it will need to be ramped up if people and organisations are sitting on valuable serviced sites. In a context were we have seen an increase in antisocial and criminal behaviour in Dublin, funding for an additional 800 gardaí and 400 civilian staff is particularly welcome. I also commend the €5.2 million in funding for victims, including vulnerable witnesses, and to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.The tax package for working people is welcome. A €50 increase in tax credits and changes to the tax bands will mean someone on the average industrial wage is €500 better off. Increases in the working from home tax deductions will assist people with the cost of energy and broadband. Should the economic environment continue to improve, I would like this project expanded next year. Ireland has faced extraordinary challenges over the past 18 months, yet this budget has still delivered the largest welfare package in years. This includes unprecedented investment in health, housing, education, childcare and justice, while also delivering a modest tax change.
