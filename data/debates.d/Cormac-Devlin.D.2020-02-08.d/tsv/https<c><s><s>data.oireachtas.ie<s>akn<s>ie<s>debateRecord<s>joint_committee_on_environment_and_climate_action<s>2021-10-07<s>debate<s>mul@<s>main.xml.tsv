CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Carberry and his colleagues for the information they supplied. First on the circular economy and the Bill, to me this is a missing piece of the puzzle. We are talking about reducing our emissions but we obviously must encourage and incentivise the public to do what they can and many people are doing what they can without any need for legislation. This committee has spoken about packaging in particular and the need to do what we can to reduce packaging and recycle it appropriately etc. Deputy Cronin was talking about social enterprise and how we can encourage that. There was an upcycling website, its name escapes me, which had information on how to reuse and share discarded items. I think it had problems with funding about a year and a half ago. I hope that the levies that are to be collected will help towards funding these initiatives. Mr. Carberry spoke about that earlier. On the heads of the Bill, Mr. Carberry's opening statement mentioned the national food waste prevention roadmap. We need to reduce our food waste by 50% by 2030. How will the Bill incentivise the proper disposal of food waste, while also discouraging the discarding of food waste? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will that roadmap go out to public consultation once the various agencies and organisations have looked at it? Is that the idea?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I think that would be a good thing. Staying on food waste, I hear what Mr. O'Donoghue is saying about commercial waste and his point on the three-bin system is fair. Within Dublin, waste management was trying to look at the by-laws about people disposing in the wrong bin in the domestic waste sphere. There was talk of fines, levies and everything else. No enough information campaigns are being conducted on the green, brown and grey or black, or sometimes purple, bins. There needs to be education around both commercial and domestic waste disposal and people need the benefits of segregating waste explained. Hopefully that will be done. I will leave that with the officials. Mr. Carberry mentioned the Minister having the power to introduce new environmental levies. Head 6 makes a proposal around regulations, which Mr. Carberry said was quite a small list. Section 3 goes on to say the amount of the levy will be specified in the regulation but should be no more than €1 per item. Will Mr. Carberry elaborate on section 4 and whether it refers to an individual producer having to pay the levy but if it is sold by a multiple, then it will be collected by them?Section 3 of head 6 concerns the €1 cap on the levy and was included to indicate the absolute theoretical maximum. We expect the levies that will be set by the regulator will be much lower, and further detail will be set out on how and when the rate of the levies can be increased. Head 4 concerns businesses selling or supplying leviable items and sets out that the person who carries out that business is responsible for the collection and payment of the levy. There may be multiple businesses carried out in the same outlet, such as a department store that has a concession area within it. An example of this would be a department store that has one till for its main business, with a concession area that has its own separate till and supplies. The person running the concession area is equally responsible for the collection of the levy for his or her business.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This would be similar to the plastic bag levy.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will conclude and come back in later as I am sure other colleagues would like to contribute. Under head 6, I note it states that section 72 of the Waste Management Act will be repealed. Is the reason for that because there will be an amalgamation of the various waste Acts?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	From our perspective, the broad parameter of the legislation is one matter while the regulations may be of more interest to us, although that is for a different day's work. I will come back in after colleagues have contributed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On head 8, the witnesses spoke of fixed penalty notices. What is envisaged there? Would the local authorities maintain those records, issue the notices and pursue them? On head 10, Mr. Carberry spoke earlier about data protection issues, which I have been aware of since September of last year. Hopefully this legislation will address those concerns. Is it envisaged that the local authorities will be the data controllers? If that is the case, I would go back to the issues of the lack of litter wardens and resources that local authorities do not have. I am thinking about their ability to maintain and issue fixed penalty notices and monitor CCTV footage, as well as the number of litter wardens available in each local authority's administrative area. Maybe the circular economy fund could assist in that regard. My final question is on head 11. Could Mr. Carberry outline what the rationale behind that particular section? In terms of investigating, detecting and prosecuting the offences, I assume that the local authority will be responsible. Mr. Carberry might elaborate, however.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Before we move on, from what the Cathaoirleach said earlier and on the basis of my experience in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, we do not have enough litter wardens. If we took a vox pop of the committee, we could all speak to our local authorities and say there are not enough litter wardens, particularly in rural local authorities which have vast areas. Senator Pauline O'Reilly referred to the laneway that is regularly dumped in. Nobody can see it but the local authority is charged with cleaning it up. It is all well and good having legislation which states that it is the responsibility of the local authority to issue the penalty notice and to do all that, but if, under the legislation, we are not looking to fund it through collecting levies, that is missing a key part of this. We have to be realistic. There is no point in having the legislation if we cannot enforce it. Enforcement is a requirement, unfortunately, in certain local authority areas because of the volume of waste that must be dealt with on a regular basis.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Hurley. We certainly need to give serious thought to this. I accept what Mr. Hurley says about the fixed-penalty notices. That assumes that the individual can be identified. One of the biggest issues, aside from whether it goes to court or not, is whether you can identify the culprit who is dumping a vast amount of stuff. I would say that, between the fixed-penalty notices and the circular fund, we need to examine how we could fund many of these positions that the local authorities will need. Finally, someone might elaborate on head 11. They might confirm that we are sticking with the fixed-penalty notices and CCTV under this head.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. That is fine.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I see. Okay. I thank Mr. Hurley for that.
