CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for taking this question. Is he aware that some parents have not received child benefit payments this month? I have received several reports of child benefit payments for children aged 16 being suspended. Before the onset of Covid-19, parents were required to have a form stamped by school authorities confirming that their child was proceeding into fourth or fifth year. The requirement was deferred last year because of the pandemic. I understand that many parents were not aware of this requirement and some did not receive forms. They now find themselves without child benefit payments. This will clearly have implications as preparations are made for the return to school in September. I contacted the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, asking her to investigate this issue. Groups such as Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, and Barnardos Ireland have also been in contact with the Department of Social Protection. Will the Minister raise this issue with the Minister for Social Protection to ensure that payments will be reinstated, pending certification, in September?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will speak briefly before we finish discussing the Bill. It is apt to mention that, since we last debated it, DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown County has approved the tender for the largest affordable housing site in the country. It will be 9 ha of social, affordable and cost-rental housing. I have spoken about it previously, but the debate on the Bill is an appropriate place to raise it again because it shows that this approach is beginning to work on the ground. I thank the Minister, particularly for the final subsection of section 5, which acknowledges those who, for whatever reason, may not be eligible for social housing. I hope that they will be able to apply for this.
