CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I acknowledge the level of support for businesses, which assists in keeping people in employment during the Covid crisis. It is unprecedented and extremely welcome. On the restart and restart plus grants, can the Minister provide information on both applications and decisions across Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Tánaiste for that. It is very encouraging to hear about the level of support, amounting to 118,600 applications, 1,646 restart plus grants and 1,191 restart grants. I pay tribute to Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council because it, like many other authorities, processed an unbelievable number of applications in a very short period. The grants have really gone to the core to assist businesses as they struggle through the pandemic. Regarding the supports to businesses outlined by the Tánaiste, maybe he will provide additional information on the number of applications by comparison with the number of approvals, and also information on issues that arose during the process.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would welcome those figures. I know that there is now discussion around the roll-out of vaccines, which is very welcome, but the impact of the pandemic is going to be with us for much of 2021. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, also acknowledged that while unemployment will remain at 15%, it may dip to 10% towards the end of 2021, which would be welcome. It is critical that we continue supports for businesses. In response to an earlier question, the Tánaiste mentioned that the new strategic tourism scheme would be launched in January, which is welcome. I ask the Tánaiste, through his offices, to consider including car rental firms in that scheme. There are about five key companies in the country which need support and have fallen outside of many of the existing schemes. It is essential that they are brought in under the umbrella of the tourism scheme or another one, if possible.
