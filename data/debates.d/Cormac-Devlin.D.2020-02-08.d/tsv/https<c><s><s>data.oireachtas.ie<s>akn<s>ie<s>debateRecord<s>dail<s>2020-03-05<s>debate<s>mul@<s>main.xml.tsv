CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for taking these statements and listening to the concerns of Members. I acknowledge the efforts of our public servants, particularly the medical staff encountering the spread of Covid-19 throughout the country. It has not, thankfully, yet been widespread but in monitoring what has happened in other jurisdictions, we may be at the beginning of something in this country. I hope I am wrong on that. I also acknowledge the efforts of others across the country, in particular the Garda, teachers, transport workers, front-line service workers and workers in shops, hotels and other service industries for their co-operation and assistance during this period. As mentioned earlier by our spokesperson on health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, general communication has been good. I call, however, for more of an open approach, particularly regarding the identification of certain areas. I do not refer to individuals because we need to protect individual identities. We need people to self-identify and we do not want to put that in jeopardy but we need to trust the public. Public health must be our main concern in all of this, and it should be our top priority at all costs.  The HPSC had identified nine cases so far but that could be ten from what we are hearing this evening. I express my solidarity to those families and individuals concerned because it is worrying for them and their communities. The public expects a plan to deal with community transmission when that happens. That needs to be forthcoming. Unfortunately, I found the Minister's statement earlier a little light on detail. I know this is an unfolding issue for him and his officials, but we need to reassure the public with more detail of the Government's future plans regarding the coronavirus. In China, 80% of the cases were mild, 15% needed treatment in hospital while 5% required intensive care treatment. On that basis, the Ministerâ€™s earlier announcement of just 20 intensive care beds is entirely insufficient, and I fear it may feed public concern. I also welcome the establishment of the Cabinet sub-committee to co-ordinate our national response. The Government must show leadership on this issue. Constitutionally, the appropriate body to exercise such power is the Government, not an ad hoc committee of the House. I welcome the guidelines put before the House earlier. The regulations to prevent the stockpiling of sanitised or medical products should be put in place. Vulnerable individuals must be guaranteed access to such products.
