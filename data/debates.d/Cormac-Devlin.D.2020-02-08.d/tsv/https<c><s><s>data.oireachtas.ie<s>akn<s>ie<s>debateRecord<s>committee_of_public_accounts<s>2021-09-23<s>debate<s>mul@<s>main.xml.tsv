CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Reid and his colleagues and I thank him for his opening remarks. I apologise as I was not here at the time, but I have read his statement since. I will start with the grant-aid agreements, which have been a welcome addition to the entire process for section 38 and 39 organisations. There is a little bit more certainty and there is good engagement between the relevant CHO and the organisations. I also welcome the fact that contract management support units are being established across the nine CHOs. I have a quick question on the grant agreements. Where an organisation exists, but spans several CHOs, surely it would make more sense to have a single service level agreement or grant agreement with one particular body of the HSE rather than multiple grant-aid agreements?Is there a process in place for such a thing? I am not aware of it but I will ask that initially.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Good. That makes sense. I thank Mr. Ryan for that clarification. In terms of the capital programme, to which Deputy Dillon referred, there is a real need for many of these section 38 and section 39 organisations, which either lease or maybe own their own building, to access capital funding. Is there any plan coming forward for that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is very hard for those organisations to try to access capital funding. While I appreciate it is limited, particularly in urban areas such as Dublin, where we need extra capacity for some of these organisations, the benefit of unlocking capital funding is that it could expand those much-needed services. To stay with the section 38 and 39 organisations, I want to ask a few questions on the internal audit. There are anomalies with the Charities Regulator as well, and I would ask the HSE to examine that aspect. The Charities Regulator is asking some of those independent boards to do one thing and the HSE audit is saying it is frowned upon, so there are some anomalies there. How many audits have taken place since the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2016 report and what is the breakdown between random and targeted audits?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Reid have a breakdown between random and targeted audits? He can come back to me on that if he wants.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have limited time. In terms of the integrated financial management and procurement system, which is known as IFMS, I know that over the last couple of weeks, and even for the last number of years, the IT systems across the HSE have been questioned. What impact have the cyberattack and the pandemic had on the original budget for the financial management and procurement system within the HSE?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Has the original date of March 2025 to have it implemented been pushed out to 2026?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The HSE might correspond with the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I did not get a chance to delve into the financial statements for 2020. On page 146, according to note 6, there has been an increase in agency staff. Is that more staff or higher salaries with the same staff?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there a need to increase the level of agency staff for this year? What is the plan there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, with retirements and whatnot. I turn to note 4 on patient income on page 143. I assume it was the pandemic which saw the reduction in a lot of these charges, particularly the E111 claims. What does the heading "Road Traffic Accident Charges" relate to?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses.
