CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Covid-19 has fundamentally changed Ireland's social and economic landscape. At the end of 2019 almost 2.3 million people were at work. Today approximately 1 million people are on some form of income support. We knew that reigniting our economy after the Covid shutdown would present significant challenges. The message from small businesses, though, is clear. They want supports. They do not want to take on additional debt. They want grants. It is important that this distinction is made. What confirmation can the T치naiste give to the House on the plans to have SMEs reopen and get people back to work?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome and support the initiatives announced to date. They have been much needed by the businesses the T치naiste speaks of. I also welcome and support the July stimulus package. I reiterate, however, the difference between the grant aid scheme and the loan scheme. Equally, I ask the T치naiste to focus on the under 25s. Approximately 250,000 people aged under 25 are unemployed, and I hope his Department will focus on that cohort too. It is now just four working days until the start date of the next phase of the reopening of the economy, and businesses need clarity on this. They need to order stock, train staff and prepare their premises. Can the T치naiste confirm when they can expect such clarity?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. It is important there is a balance between the two. I wish to reiterate and focus on the fact that it is estimated that 2.1 million people will return to work. That is approximately 90% of the pre-Covid number of people in employment. That 90% has presented and, I have no doubt, will present challenges over the coming months, but the 10% who are expected not to return to work must not be left behind. As I said earlier, I would focus on the under 25s. We do not want to see young people long-term unemployed if at all possible. We need to look at schemes and initiatives to get them back to work as quickly as possible.
