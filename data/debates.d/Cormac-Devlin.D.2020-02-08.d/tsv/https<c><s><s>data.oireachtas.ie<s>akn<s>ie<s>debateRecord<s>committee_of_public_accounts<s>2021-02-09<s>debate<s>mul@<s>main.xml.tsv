CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman. I thank the witnesses for their time and for answering the questions they can answer. I understand that the report to which they have referred is due at the end of the month. It is a pity that it is not available to the committee today because it would help to inform members on many of the questions we have. Notwithstanding that, I understand the report will provide more information on the 700-odd claims that have been asked about already. On the issue of outpatients and the urgent care centres at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals, Mr. Gunning stated that they are being fitted out. I understand that the centre at Connolly Hospital opened in July 2019. Are there any outstanding claims relating to those centres that are being developed or kitted out or have been opened? Is it the same contractor?  On the issue of the HSE grant, how much is the HSE grant to date? I am not sure whether that is a question for Mr. Dempsey. One of the other witnesses may have that information. I note that the grant had been increasing year on year since the start of the project. I ask the witnesses to inform the committee in that regard. On the PwC report from April 2019, I note that there are several recommendations in the report.I understand members of the board appeared before this committee previously, although not Mr. Gunning. As I understand it, he started in his role in September 2019. The cost of that PwC report and the recommendations contained in it are of interest to me with respect to the impact they had on the project. I have heard today that, unfortunately, costs may still be increasing every month as well as the timeline for the delivery of this muc- needed hospital. Mr. Gunning might respond to those points. I advise the Chair I might come in again in the short period I have remaining.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Devine for that response. Was the unit in Connolly Hospital delivered on budget and on time, or what was the scale with the delivery of that unit?
