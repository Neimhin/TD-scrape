CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for all their work to date. As a precursor to their work, we had to navigate the Bill in pre-legislative scrutiny so we feel their pain over recent months. The fact they had met more than 15 times by September, despite the pandemic, is to be commended, because I am sure it is not easy with everybody coming from across the country. I apologise for not coming in earlier, I had another meeting. Professor Ó Gallachóir mentioned the issue of transition and monitoring the pace of change in various sectors and Departments. I apologise if this has already been asked, but will he outline how that will be monitored for the purposes of the annual review? He mentioned in his opening statement the offsetting of targets within sectors and how that might be done. I think he mentioned negative targeting. Will he elaborate on that? With regard to just transition, will Ms King speak on how the monitoring of potential displacement within sectors will be done and how it might impact on workers?
