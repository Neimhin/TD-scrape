CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Regarding the €7 million mentioned, there is concern about the money that has already been given to local authorities for active travel in the context of those local authorities that have not spent it. A great deal of money has been returned to the Department, as he is aware. What is being done to bulk-up the number of staff to ensure local authorities have the correct resources to spend the money being allocated to them? It is unfair that this money is being allocated to them and they cannot spend it. In situations where some local authorities do not spend money, I think I heard the Minister say the money will be spent by other local authorities-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am sorry. The €7 million was referred to in the Minister statement and I thought this related to active travel. Perhaps it is related to climate measures instead. It was actually climate mitigation that was referred to, but I do not have a copy of the Minister's statement. I ask him to elaborate on what is being done in respect of resources for local authorities. I am conscious of situations, and using the analogy of active travel, where money is given to local authorities but then some of that money is being returned nearly as fast to the Minister's Department. Turning to group schemes, where several tenants are on such a group scheme, what is being done to relieve the pressure on them under the current measures? In addition, and similar to the point made regarding the Traveller community, what can be done for people living in situations where they need assistance and they may be on a shared meter in multi-unit developments?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What can be done for those in group schemes and multi-unit developments that share a meter?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand why the Minister does not want to detail the two sides that are earmarked for the emergency generation, but in the briefing note that we received it is obviously up to the winter of 2025-26. Does he envisage that we will need additional capacity after that if the circumstances continue between now between now and then?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Returning to the emergency power generation scheme, I note that there is €150 million allocated to it. There is another €150 million added to subhead B13, which is the energy transformation programme. On something we spoke about previously, has the Minister explored and engaged with the existing infrastructure to try to keep what we have already, expanding the life span of existing sites around the country to ensure that there is a supply of gas and other materials? Has that happened in tandem with looking at new sites for energy generation? The Minister might come back on that and then I will have other questions.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thought the Minister mentioned the Corrib gasfield in one of his responses earlier. Has that been explored with a view to extending it? Is that being considered?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fair enough. The Minister mentioned a plan for maritime development and climate action, including the establishment of a marine and climate directorate. He said his Department is committing €1 million. It is envisaged it will be €3.5 million in a once-off fund for this year to support the setup of that function. Will the Minister elaborate more on that marine and climate directorate?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In the establishment of that directorate, if only €1 million is being committed to it this year, does that jeopardise the applications for offshore wind? Obviously, from what the Minister is saying, An Bord Pleanála does not possess the skills right now.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister.
