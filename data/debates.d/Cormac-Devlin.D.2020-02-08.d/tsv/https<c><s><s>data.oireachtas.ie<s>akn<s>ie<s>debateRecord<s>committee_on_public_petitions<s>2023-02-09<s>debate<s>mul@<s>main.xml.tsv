CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Deputy Higgins touched on some of the questions I was going to raise. Before I ask other questions, though, I am glad that Deputy McGrath is present. As someone who is meant to be an impartial Chair, I ask the Chairman to question Deputy McGrath's statement about people covering for one another. It was unfair to the officials and to the Member, who was not in the room at the time. I ask that it be withdrawn by the Deputy and that the Chairman ensure that is done.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is not fair.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am a member of this committee, Deputy.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Standing Order still obtains. The comment should be withdrawn.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to ask questions of the witnesses. We had a beneficial engagement with members of the action group previously. I can understand the concern, emotion and involvement of the local community on this issue. Everyone is attached to his or her local health service. For Carrick-on-Suir, this seems to be an extremely personal situation. For example, we heard from the action group of personal experiences with St. Brigid's. I appreciate all of that. The contribution by Ms Killeen White and her colleagues today has been interesting in that it has provided a little more explanation about the decisions that have been taken. In my questioning at our previous meeting, I had some regard to the HIQA report. Many statements have been made. For example, Ms Killeen White referred today to the "dedication, commitment and excellent care" provided at St. Brigid's. That must be noted. It was also noted in the HIQA report. The action group highlighted that just one or two elements of the report were given as reasons for closure. In the group's eyes, those reasons were not sufficient. According to the information provided by Ms Killeen White and her colleagues today, though, the hospital was not safe in a modern context. Ms Killeen White just told my colleague Deputy Higgins that the hospital was not suitable as a Covid treatment centre. I believe Ms Killeen White stated that one patient had been admitted to it. Now, the hospital has been morphed into a new health centre or hub, as it were. Ms Killeen White mentioned diabetes and administrative care. Have staff members lost their employment as a result of the changes at St. Brigid's or is the staffing level the same?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is the new centre adjacent to the hospital?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the hospital's reconfiguration and the new services being provided on the campus, what is the short-to-medium-term plan for the building?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Killeen White mentioned the new 20 palliative care beds. Obviously, they will not be in Tipperary and will instead be located just across the border in, I believe, Waterford. Those services are being availed of. I am glad to hear someone from the HSE acknowledging the great work being done in palliative care. People would be lost without that care, in particular the outreach programmes. I represent DÃºn Laoghaire in Dublin. Our local hospice was recently redeveloped, which placed a significant strain on services. Thankfully, Our Lady's Hospice was able to continue providing its excellent care through the outreach service, supplemented by the Wicklow Hospice. At our previous meeting, the action group acknowledged the fantastic care provided to residents and patients at St. Brigid's. Deputy McGrath has left. I thank the Chair for his intervention in the matter, but it is unfortunate the Deputy would not withdraw the remarks. The Deputy mentioned that, contrary to the Minister of State's comment, the building was less than 200 years of age. I believe he said it was 180 years old. In Ms Killeen White's remarks, though, she referred to 1817, which would make it 206 years old. Is that correct? Was it a workhouse that later became a healthcare facility?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to ask Mr. Ruane about his involvement. Everyone present is trying to do his or her best. The officials have attended to try to explain what is happening from their perspective, and the committee appreciates that. We have been debating this issue for quite some time and it is good to hear the official side as well as the community side. Unfortunately, I do not believe we will be successful at this meeting in reaching an amicable resolution between the two sides. However, I hope a solution that each views as workable can be found. It will not be easily done.Mr. Ruane mentioned the plans, and the Chair referenced the floodplain and everything else. What are the plans in the short to medium term for the future prospects of the overall campus? I heard Ms Killeen White talk about the administrative side, diabetic care and everything else. What is the vision for the overall campus in the short to medium term?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that in St. Anthony's?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Did Ms McDaid say it would be a minimum, not maximum, of two beds?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No one better than Deputy Cahill. Fair play to him. I will focus on the holistic care in St. Brigid's itself, and public and private nursing home care. It was referenced in the opening statement that there are 147 HSE beds across four units and 522 private nursing home beds across 13 private providers. Is their use at full capacity at present? How has it been since the restrictions eased? That obviously meant a return to somewhat normal levels.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have two final questions. Reference was made to ongoing recruitment. I think the term "24 whole equivalents" was used for existing staff but there are a number of vacancies. The opening statement referenced the fact that the physiotherapist clinical specialist post is currently vacant, as is the senior physiotherapist post. It is no secret that there are gaps in recruitment and retention issues right across the service, as well as issues in trying to recruit the correct staff for the correct locations. How long have the advertised posts been vacant? Are these new or replacement posts? What is their current status?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The new posts are obviously good news. How long have they been advertised?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. How many of the replacement posts are currently vacant?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I again thank the witnesses for their contributions. Like others, I have a contribution to make in the Chamber but it has been very worthwhile to get the information. I very much thank the officials for their time. I appreciate it.
