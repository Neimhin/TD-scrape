CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chair and welcome the Minister, as well as Dr. Glynn, Dr. De Gascun and Professor Nolan, here today. My first question is to the Minister. The HSE appeared before the committee yesterday, and Mr. Paul Reid stated that the HSE was recruiting up to 3,5000 new staff to increase its test and trace capacity. Will this be sufficient to meet demand in the coming months?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Dr. Glynn and thank him for taking the time to appear before the committee. As all the witnesses appearing today are extremely busy, the committee appreciates their return before it. I have a question on the return of children to school and the impact it has had on infection rates. While there has been an increase in testing activity both for pupils and teachers, what is the comparative percentage of positive tests for those aged between four and 14 years of age for August and for September?
