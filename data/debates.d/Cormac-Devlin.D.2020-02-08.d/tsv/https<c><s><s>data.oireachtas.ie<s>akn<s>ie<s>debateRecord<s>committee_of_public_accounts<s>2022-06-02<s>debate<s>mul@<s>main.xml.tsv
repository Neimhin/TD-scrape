CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. McCarthy and thank him for the briefing information provided in advance of the meeting. I will stick with Oberstown to start with because Deputy Burke was speaking about it a moment ago. It was mentioned that there is capacity for 46 inmates and is it fair to say they are the higher end of the more challenging youths, as detention centres go in the State? Would it be classified as that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. McCarthy mentioned funding relating to Oberstown, which increased over the past while. I think €24 million was expended under the programme in 2020. He also referred to education, training and other supports for those who are on licence there. What kind of uptake is there in that centre for the services that are there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What was the percentage uptake in that regard?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be helpful. On the €24 million, what was done? Was there an extension or refurbishment?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was current funding, okay. In terms of capital funding, what was the spend?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was that €3.8 million an increase or decrease on the 2019 figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. McCarthy might come back to us.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McCarthy. Our time is limited. On ECCE and programme B specifically, in the Department's appropriation accounts, under the heading "Agency services", it is stated that Pobal administers that particular programme. There was an advance of €518 million to Pobal in relation to note 6.1. What was that advance for?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was €518 million advanced to Pobal in 2020.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Correct.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was the change in the Department? Was there a change and transfer from it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. I thank the Mr. McCarthy for that. On procurement compliance, there the 151 contracts spoken about earlier and €91 million relating to the provision of international protection accommodation. I hear what he said about how we are kind of at the upper end of that budget for this year given the numbers and that is excluding the Ukrainians who are coming into the country. Then there was one contract for €29,000, in excess of that, for the commission of investigation and one contract in relation to €74,000. I heard what was said as well about reforms and note also that "Audits are conducted to DPER/CIIA standards" and "The internal audit function is reviewed periodically". How often is it reviewed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would it be annually or biannually?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask that Mr. McCarthy come back to us. Are the officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are on the line be able to come in on how often that review is done of the internal audit?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is stated that the audits are conducted to Department of Public Expenditure and Reform standards, and not by that Department. Pardon me. That is fair enough. I ask that Mr. McCarthy come back to us on that if he would not mind. I noticed there were a number of legal cases in the information. It is in note 6.2, which is headed "Compensation and legal costs". I noticed there were 20 injuries in the course of work in 2020. Were they cases that were just taken and that arose in 2020 or were they ones that were paid out in 2020?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, and obviously cases take different times.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is annually. I thank Mr. McCarthy. Under "Other claims" there are three. What do they relate to, as they are claims by employees, if they are not injuries in the workplace?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. Then there are nine personal injury claims and a challenge to the children's referendum that dates back to 2019. What was that relating to?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It took that amount of time, until 2019, to deal with it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Wow. Okay. In the last few minutes I have left, I have another question on the accounts. There was funding from the EU under a heading that was highlighted. It is "EU receipts", with €6 million being an estimate of what was to be received in 2020 and the outturn €5.4 million in respect of the asylum, migration and integration fund. Is that separate to the fund we were speaking about earlier when Mr. McCarthy said referred to asylum or international protection? How does that EU receipts funding differ from what we were talking about earlier in terms of us being under pressure with our current budget for 2020?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Given we were talking about the IPAS system and the funding for 2020 and the current year. As well as that funding in 2020 for the EU receipts, which was nearly expended, it is fair to say - there was €600,000 shy of the estimated provision for it - would it be fair to say the money that is allocated to our refugee and asylum programmes is under strain in the current year, with everything that is going on?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the intervention programmes for children and young people. Given the year that was in it, there was a shortfall in expenditure in 2020 of €922,000. There were delays in projects associated with expenditure. Have those projects been subsequently funded to the maximum and are they back on track now?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This is subhead B8, which relates to intervention programmes for children and young people.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. McCarthy might come back to us on that. It would be really important to ensure that cohort of children and young people are not losing out.
