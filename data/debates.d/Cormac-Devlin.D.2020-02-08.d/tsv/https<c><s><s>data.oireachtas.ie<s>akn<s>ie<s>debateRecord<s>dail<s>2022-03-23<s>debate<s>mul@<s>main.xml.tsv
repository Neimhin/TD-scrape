CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We are very grateful in this House for the efforts of our front-line healthcare workers during the pandemic. They put themselves in danger and went above and beyond what was expected. The Government recently agreed to pay a €1,000 bonus to front-line workers in recognition of their extraordinary efforts. However, following recent media reports about the payment structure being considered, many part-time nurses have been in contact with me. They are worried that the proposed payment structure will see their bonus reduced to just €200. Everyone across the House recognises the need to be prudent with public money, but there is also a need to be fair and do right by people. Will the Minister engage with his colleagues and ask that a generous approach be taken, one that recognises the sacrifice made by all front-line healthcare workers, whether full-time or part-time?
