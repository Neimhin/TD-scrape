CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree with the last point the Chairman made. We should follow up with Irish Water, first and foremost, and see what response comes from that. Perhaps we could then go to the council and take it from there. Unless the secretariat has something to offer contrary to that, I think that is the best way to approach the matter.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We have redone the website and promoted the facility of this committee to the public. What level of uptake have we had? For the next meeting, is it possible to compare the level of engagement? Could we also consider other ways of promoting the committee through our engagement with various ombudsmen and, more importantly, the public directly?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Perhaps we could have a discussion at our next virtual meeting of ways in which to do that. It would be important to examine how many petitions we have taken compared with previously. This year has been a difficult one to use in a comparison, but speaking as a newer member of the committee, it would be interesting to see what level of engagement we have had over the years month on month or whatever the case may be. Perhaps we could put that on the agenda for our next meeting or the meeting after that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Go raibh maith agat.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is its a two-hour session or a three-hour one?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No pressure but we want the number of petitions to skyrocket after that video.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	A cross-party TikTok. I have never heard of it.
