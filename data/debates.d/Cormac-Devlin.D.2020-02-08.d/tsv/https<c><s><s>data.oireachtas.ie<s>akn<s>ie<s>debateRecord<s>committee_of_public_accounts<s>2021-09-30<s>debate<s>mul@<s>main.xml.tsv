CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses. I will have to head away after this as I must return to the Chamber. I thank Mr. McDonagh and the Comptroller and Auditor General for their opening statements. I will ask a few brief questions. Mr. McDonagh has highlighted that NAMA does not own the development sites in its portfolio and that they are instead owned by the debtors, which is straightforward enough. How many of the sites that were in the guardianship of NAMA, as it were, had full planning permission? Does Mr. McDonagh have that figure to hand?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Roughly.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If a debtor did not maintain or extend the planning permission for one of those sites, the value of that asset would have depreciated significantly. Did NAMA encourage debtors to extend or maintain their planning permissions?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This follows on from my questioning when NAMA was before the committee last year. I want to know whether there has been active management of those portfolios, given that we, as the taxpayers, want to ensure that we get the most value out of them. Is Mr. McDonagh telling us that his team actively encouraged and supported the extension of those planning permissions?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. Mr. McDonagh specifically referenced the Dublin docklands. Was the figure he cited 86%?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that the figure for completions in the SDZ?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that on track?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How does that figure compare to the Poolbeg West SDZ, which had a much later start than the Dublin docklands?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I presume I have a few minutes, Chairman. Will Mr. McDonagh touch on the wind-down? He referenced the strategic plan from 2022 to 2025. What does it entail? He might talk the committee through it. The next time we speak, NAMA will probably be in the throes of that plan.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The witness mentioned Fingal and Kildare.
