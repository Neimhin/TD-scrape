CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Gloster and his team for being with us this morning. In his opening statement Mr. Gloster said he had been in situ with Tusla for 24 months. I congratulate him on that, but I can imagine it has been a tumultuous 24 months, particularly for Tusla and all of the staff in the organisation with the work they do. We acknowledge that. Recently I asked two parliamentary questions about the number of front-line social workers in Dublin. There were 506 whole-time equivalents in December 2020. This fell by eight to 498 in June of this year. Taking into consideration what my colleague Deputy McAuliffe referred to about Dublin north city, the parliamentary questions also confirmed Tusla was in the process of recruiting 181 social workers in Dublin to the end of August, and 102 posts were listed as recruitment complete, 48 of those posts accepted, 31 were posts in progress, and I am not sure what happened to the remaining 23. Will Mr. Gloster confirm how many front-line social workers there are across the five Dublin Tusla areas currently, having recruited 102? Have the people in those 102 posts started?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that for the current year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I presume this is probably what happened with the 23 who are listed here. Would I be right in saying there are 600 social workers now in situ in post across Dublin or has that figure changed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Those figures would be good to have, including the breakdown by area. Some of the figures were supplied to me in response to a parliamentary question recently, just about two weeks ago, so I have that. I also note from the figures that, as of December 2020, there were 1,169 staff members.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, and there were also 34 from agency. I might get to that later on in the second round questions because I am very limited for time. Mr. Gloster mentioned the 99 new recruits, which is very welcome. Based on a significant proportion of the staff working as front-line social workers, does Mr. Gloster feel there is adequate supervision and training, given that more than the 20% of the social workers are new starts? It would be a relatively high level of untrained staff. I am aware they have been academically trained, but in going into an organisation such as Tusla initially, is adequate supervision and training given to those new recruits?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course. I appreciate what Mr. Gloster said earlier about those who leave the organisation in under two years or under five years. Given the area in which some are working, be it the volume or types of caseloads, I appreciate this is going to be a challenge for some of them. I turn to more operational matters. In the accounts there is a cost of â‚¬34 million for administration, payroll and so on. Are social workers provided with mobile phones if they are working for the organisation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask that because there are reports that front-line and duty social workers are not giving out their mobile numbers to individuals, or indeed email addresses. It is very hard, even for Members of the Oireachtas, to engage with the organisation. There is one email address and that is it. Will this be reviewed under Mr. Gloster's tenure as CEO?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On that latter point, I can absolutely appreciate that. I do not want to demean it by any stretch of the imagination. Given some of the extremely challenging areas and situations in which Tusla staff are working, I absolutely can appreciate why the mobile phone numbers would not be readily available. I am talking about general run-of-the-mill cases. Are business cards provided to staff?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Gloster for that. It would be helpful for us as a committee if Mr. Gloster would send us a note after this engagement today on the procedure around staff engaging with service users and how readily contactable they are.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Gloster will appreciate the people who are engaged with the organisation want to be able to engage, and if Tusla is ringing them, they would like to be able to call back the individuals who are dealing with them. I thank Mr. Gloster for that. In my last minute, will Mr. Gloster confirm if Tusla carries out quantitative and qualitative research on the outcomes of cases, particularly across various socioeconomic areas and communities, to ensure the quality of treatment of all children? Is that being done at present?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Has that started?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask Mr. Gloster to furnish any information he has on that to the committee.
