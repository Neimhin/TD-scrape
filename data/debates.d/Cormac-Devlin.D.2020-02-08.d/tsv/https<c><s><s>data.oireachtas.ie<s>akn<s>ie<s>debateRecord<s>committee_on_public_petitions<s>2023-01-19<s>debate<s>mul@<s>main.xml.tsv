CormacDevlin	 Vice Chairman	2020-02-08	None	Good afternoon members and welcome to our witnesses. The next speaker is Deputy Matt Shanahan.
CormacDevlin	 Vice Chairman	2020-02-08	None	I had intended to speak from the floor, but the Chairman has sent his apologies because he is going to speak in the Dáil shortly. I, too, thank the witnesses for coming in and for sharing their experiences. Obviously, a number of people are part of the campaign. Deputy Higgins just mentioned the sizeable petition and the number of signatories. I can empathise with the witnesses' situation. They spoke passionately of their fond memories as children of St. Brigid's and their personal experiences and loss. So many families not just in County Tipperary but also in the wider area will have experienced similar loss. Palliative care is important. We cannot underestimate the value of that type of care. I represent Dún Laoghaire and in my own area a step-down facility closed not too long ago. We are in the process of determining whether that facility may be repurposed for the benefit of primary care or indeed other healthcare services. From my understanding, and the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong, but St. Brigid's is currently being used as a community healthcare centre. There was also talk of a diabetes clinic being opened. I should declare that I am the Chair of the Oireachtas cross-party diabetes committee. I know, from our experience, that there is a need for better facilities for those with diabetes. That being said, the group's campaign is nonetheless important because of the amount of people who obviously feel great attachment to St. Brigid's. I know that a lot of questions have been asked of the witnesses. There will be a broad recap of the questions posed. Deputy Higgins mentioned the Joint Committee on Health. I think the group has engaged with the committee. Perhaps the witnesses can clarify that for us. This is my first engagement with the Save St. Brigid's Action Group. How many people are in the group? Is one of the witnesses the chairperson or secretary of the group? Who has that enviable job? The witnesses have mentioned that St. Brigid's closed in April 2020. In terms of the group's meetings to date and practical steps taken, in that period the group has met with the HSE directly and it handed a petition to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, outside Leinster House. I am sure there have been other meetings. I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that. As I have said in our private meetings, I personally feel that the Joint Committee on Health is probably a better fit for where the group is at in terms of the campaign. That being said, this committee also hears issues of public concern, and there is clearly concern around the closure of St. Brigid's. Moving back to the role of Acting Chairperson, in terms of the questions that have been asked by various colleagues, including Deputy Cahill and others, I ask the witnesses to respond at their leisure. I do not know who wants to go first.
CormacDevlin	 Vice Chairman	2020-02-08	None	I was just wondering whether our guests have had meetings with the HSE.
CormacDevlin	 Vice Chairman	2020-02-08	None	Our guests might also take the other questions that were asked. I acknowledge some of the contributions were statements rather than questions, but they might wish to respond to some of them.
