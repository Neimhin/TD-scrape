CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses. It is good to engage with them again. I will stay with the private nursing homes. I understand the HSE is tasked with the management of the health repayments scheme. It was referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports at various times. The most recent accounts were signed off by the then CEO, as Accounting Officer, Mr. Paul Reid on 26 November 2021. I understand 35,417 applications were made to the repayments scheme and 20,302 claimants received a payment. As of 31 December 2021, €453 million had been paid to claimants and €32.5 million paid in administrative costs or a total of €486 million in overall cost to the Exchequer from 2006 to 2020 was paid. That was referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement this morning. The HSE webpage on the repayment scheme notes that a few complex cases are still being progressed. The Comptroller and Auditor General previously commented on this repayment scheme as part of the 2009 report on the accounts of public services, which came before this committee in 2011. The report examined the incidence of appeals and legal actions arising from that scheme. That report stated:Proceedings have been instituted in 306 cases, involving patients who spent time in private nursing home facilities. None of the cases have yet proceeded to hearings.That is according to the 2009 report so that may have changed. It would be helpful to the committee this morning if it had an indication of how many cases brought by residents in private nursing homes or their families were settled and how many are still active. Can Mr. Mulvany advise how many of the 306 cases that have been settled are included in the category of a few complex cases, which is stated on the website still?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Department is, yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is the Department able to shed any light on that? I think it is 2013 since the Department has been handling the cases.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is under note 9, as the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined in his statement. Will Mr O’Grady state from 2013 onwards how many cases have been settled?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Did Mr. O’Grady not think that was topical and look at it in advance of this session?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. O’Grady find it and furnish it by the end of the meeting? It is a long session, as the Chair said, and we are breaking at 11 a.m., so maybe that information could be found. I referenced €32.5 million in administrative costs for the scheme between 2006 and 2020. This figure includes almost €4 million in legal and professional fees. Will the CEO confirm if this figure includes legal fees accrued from defending the cases? Does he have a breakdown between legal and professional fees?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The €32.5 million is only for the administration of what they were entitled to as per the legislation. For anybody who took a case who was outside those parameters, there is additional cost associated with that. Is that right?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Can the CFO shed any light on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Department does not have the number of cases, but does it have the figure for the cost of defence or litigation in relation to the scheme or to those who fall outside the scheme? Does it have a cost, at all, of any legal fees?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate the witnesses have some figures. However, it is a pity, given the public comment and comment within the Houses of the Oireachtas on this issue and the fact it was given in the briefing in advance of today that it would be raised that they do not have the breakdown. Mr O’Grady said 13 in 2020. Is that right?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand the Attorney General is preparing a memo for Cabinet on the legal strategy employed by the State, Department of Health and HSE to defend these claims, which is due to be published next week. It has been reported there are two substantive memos detailing legal strategy in this area, one from 2011 and another from 2017. I am conscious of the CEO's time spent in the role, but is he aware of any other substantive memos on this that the committee should be aware of?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the 2021 liability, €1.7 million was calculated for the health repayment scheme. The estimated provision for the repayment scheme was €1.7 million spent in 2021, while only €486 million of the estimated scheme cost of €1 billion has been spent to date. In December 2021, the figure was €486 million, which works out at an average of nearly €22,600 per claimant. How was the 2021 contingent liability of €1.7 million for the health scheme calculated by, I presume, the HSE?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. I return to the applications to the scheme. There were 35,417 applicants and 20,302 claimants received payment. The witnesses have alluded to people outside the parameters of the legislation etc. Were any refused for reasons other than legislative? Was there a bulk reason for refusal based on certain criteria? Are the witnesses aware of any other criteria applied for refusals of these applicants?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The CFO commented on the €1.7 million. The website states a few complex cases are still being processed. I understand those complex cases are being dealt with by the Department of Health since 2013.The HSE has no more hand, act or part in this scheme at all. It is all the Department of Health now. Is that correct?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does the HSE have an average payout per the scheme for claimants? Every case is obviously different as per stay etc., but is this working out as an average per claimant?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
