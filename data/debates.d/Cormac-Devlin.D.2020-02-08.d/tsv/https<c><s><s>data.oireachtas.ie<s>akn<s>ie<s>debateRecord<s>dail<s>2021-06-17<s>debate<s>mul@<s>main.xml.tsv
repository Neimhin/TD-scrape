CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As the House will not be sitting tomorrow, I would like the Dáil to recall the late Detective Garda Colm Horkan, who died while on duty in Roscommon on 18 June 2020. Irish citizens living abroad who received the Sinopharm vaccine, among others, and who are now considered fully vaccinated by the World Health Organization, are facing discrimination by EU and Irish authorities by being compelled to enter mandatory hotel quarantining if returning to Ireland from various countries. What does the Government intend to do to vindicate their rights?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Hourigan. I welcome this discussion on the impact the Covid pandemic has had on people with disabilities and their families. I thank the Ministers of State, Deputies Madigan and Rabbitte, for giving their time to the debate this evening. In particular, I acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and her staff to prioritise people with disabilities during the pandemic. She has been available to Deputies on all sides of the House at all times and this is greatly appreciated. It is important to acknowledge that the Covid pandemic has had a devastating impact on people with disabilities, their families and service providers. It was encouraging to see services resume in special schools from 22 February last, as well as in-class teaching from March. I pay tribute to everyone working in the sector, particularly teachers, SNAs, transport and sanitation workers and everybody who made school facilities safe to reopen. However, I have been made aware of difficulties arising for certain healthcare workers and others who are still awaiting their second AstraZeneca vaccination. I ask the Ministers of State to raise that matter with the HSE. I am aware that a statement was issued some days ago in this regard but it is important that we see the issue resolved as soon as possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has gone to considerable lengths to meet with parents' groups in my constituency, such as the parents of children in Carmona Services and she organised a meeting with stakeholders earlier this week. That was greatly appreciated. Perhaps she will refer in her closing statement to the implementation of the progressing disability services, PDS, programme in special schools, with particular reference to the need to ensure services remain based on site. The cyberattack the HSE has had to grapple with in the shadow of the pandemic also has had a devastating impact on its ability to provide services. For us in this House, it has had a particular impact on our ability to represent our constituents. It is imperative that the parliamentary question system, as it interacts with the HSE, be restored as soon as possible. Will the Minister of State speak to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, about this? It is important that the facility resumes as soon as possible. In the time remaining, I want to refer to the July provision. While the recent announcement is crucial and very welcome, I agree with my colleague, Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan, that an online portal might be the best way to proceed.It is cumbersome, particularly for the schools that do not offer the service. Parents have to seek July provision at home. That presents its own challenges. For many parents with children who have disabilities, it is tough for them to continuously go out and seek services. If services were available easily at the click of a button, or indeed if it were easier to apply for them, it would be easier for all of them.
