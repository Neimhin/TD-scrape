CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Like Senator Higgins, I will stand as otherwise our guests will not see me. I missed some of the contributions until the speakers stood up. I thank the Chairman, Deputy Leddin, for all of his work in organising today's meeting. In particular, I thank the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, a colleague of mine whose brainchild it was to open up the Seanad and ensure we heard at first hand from young people across the country. I thank all our guests for their contributions. I know some of our invited guests could not be here because the date of the meeting changed. I hope they will be able to participate when we engage with other groups in the next while, just as our guests have this morning.I am struck in this engagement by the passion demonstrated by the witnesses for the topic we are discussing today and how competent and confident they are. Mr. Galvin is the only Dub here and it did not faze him at all to go first. He was controversial, if I may say it, in raising the question of nuclear energy but it is a discussion we must have. It will happen in this Chamber and the Dáil Chamber. It will happen around Ireland. The debate on energy security has moved on now, given the events of the past couple of months, and particularly those starting 100 days ago in Ukraine. We must look at all options for energy. It was not just the question of energy that people have raised. They spoke about packaging, for example. Mr. Mustafa spoke about packaging and there is no choice for many of the products we purchase in shops. It is something that we as a committee have discussed with the circular economy legislation. We must try to take measures, both domestically and in Europe, and I was pleased to see so many MEPs sitting in the Gallery to listen to the contributions. If I were 16 and was invited to the Chamber, it would have been a great privilege for me. This demonstrates the engagement that is at the disposal of young people, whether it is through Comhairle na nÓg or Foróige. Today is a unique day and the witnesses rose to the challenge without any hesitation. Each and every one is very passionate about this topic and the witnesses spur us on because they engage with us. Let this not be the only engagement, and I know it will not be for many of the witnesses. We look for ideas and suggestions, including when new legislation is coming or there is public consultation for various initiatives being run by the Government. I ask each and every one of the witnesses to try to engage with the process. No matter how small, large or costly the ideas may be, we must hear them. Today should not be their last day to have their voices heard. Despite what Deputy Farrell has said, many of them may sit in this beautiful Chamber or the Chamber down the hall, elected in their own right. I hope they are and that many of them consider a life of public representation. It is really necessary that we hear their thoughts and ideas and that they get to implement them in times to come. I can feel the stares so I am sure I am over my two-minute allocation at this point. I mentioned energy and I was also struck by the biodiversity question posed to us. It is something the committee has engaged with quite a bit. My colleagues, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan and Senator Timmy Dooley, would have liked to have been here today but could not be. With regard to public transport, Mr. Thomson mentioned how he got here and I am very impressed by it and the fact that he managed to get here, given all the challenges we have heard about in Dublin Airport over the past couple of days. He raises a very good point about rural transport and options that he does not have. Somewhere like my constituency in Dún Laoghaire, on the other hand, has plenty of public transport, although that does not mean everybody uses it. It is yet another challenge we must face. I will end with a question for Foróige, whose members mentioned its Ecollective. I wonder how often it meets as a group. The members mentioned its main role involving climate justice, for which I commend them. How do they engage with individuals that they perceive to be at the fore of climate action? Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown has a very active Comhairle na nÓg and I engage with it from time to time. I ask each and every one of the groups to engage with local representatives because today is unique and historic. Well done to each and every one of the contributors but let it not be the last occasion.
