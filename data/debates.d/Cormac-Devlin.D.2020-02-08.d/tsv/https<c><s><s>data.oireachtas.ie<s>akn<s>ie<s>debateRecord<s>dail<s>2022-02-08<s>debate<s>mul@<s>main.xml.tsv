CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Taoiseach will be aware of the significant impact that inflation is having on individuals and families across this country. The budget's increases in the fuel allowance were welcome, as are plans to give householders €113 credit against their electricity bills. However, these measures will only go so far. We know that inflation is likely to be higher than what was anticipated at the time of the budget. Will the Taoiseach consider increasing the electricity credit beyond €113 and rolling out an improved retrofitting scheme for minor improvements, for example, attic or other home insulation schemes?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Workers have returned, and are returning, to offices across the country, with many now working on a hybrid basis. Some work some days in the office and others work remotely from locations either at home or within the local town or village. However, the increased cost of fuel is having a significant impact on those workers. As part of efforts to combat climate change, promote modal shift and support workers, will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Transport to consider introducing free or discounted public transport options on a trial basis, perhaps here in the capital? This could include free or discounted fares for 90-minute journeys for all commuters across DART, Luas, bus or intercity services.
