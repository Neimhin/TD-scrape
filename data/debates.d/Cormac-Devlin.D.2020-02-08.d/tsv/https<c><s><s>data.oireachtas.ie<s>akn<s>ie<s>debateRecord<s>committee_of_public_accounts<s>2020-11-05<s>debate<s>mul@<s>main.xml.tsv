CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My thanks to the witnesses for attending and for the information they have provided. I wish to ask three specific questions. The first relates to the insurance compensation fund. A repayment of €80 million was made to the Exchequer and to the fund in 2019. This will reduce outstanding balance to €555.7 million as of 31 December this year. When is that balance due to be repaid? Were any amounts received this year? My second question relates to the financial accounts for 2019. I have before me section 11 of the financial statements. My question relates to the State savings schemes. The figures show a comparison between 2018 and 2019. I gather that the Department will not have figures for 2020 yet but I assume there will be an increase this year in terms of investment in those schemes. Can the officials elaborate on that? My third question relates to the statements for current non-voted expenditure. One thing that caught my eye was the sugar levy. There is an amount for 2018 but nothing for 2019. Why is that? Will the officials come back to me on those questions, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It relates to non-voted expenditure and sugar levies. I note that there is an amount for 2018 but nothing for 2019. Why is that? It is in statement 1.6, which deals with non-voted expenditure.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is no problem. My final question relates to the appearance of officials before the committee last May. There was a recommendation from the committee about insufficient progress being made on the PULSE system. Work was due to be completed by 2020. I realise the officials might not have the information at the committee today, but perhaps they can come back to me on that. I understand clear timelines were agreed by the Central Statistics Office and An Garda Síochána. I would be interested in anything the Department has on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is perfect.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Returning to the accounts and the capital receipts from the European Union, there is a differential between the figure for 2018 and 2019 for the European Regional Development Fund. I am sure there is a reason for that, which the witnesses can come back to me with if they do not know it today.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, in particular in regard to those projects that we discussed.
