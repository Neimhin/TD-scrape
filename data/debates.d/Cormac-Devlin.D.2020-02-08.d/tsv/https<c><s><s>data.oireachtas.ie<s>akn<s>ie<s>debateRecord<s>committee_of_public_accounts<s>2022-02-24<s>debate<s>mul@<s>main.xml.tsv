CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome all of our witnesses. I listened carefully to the opening statements, particularly from the Comptroller and Auditor General. Colleagues have already raised the searchable database and the 60% increase in its cost. Why was there no oversight group within the RTB to manage such a system given the level of expenditure involved?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Given the outside consultancy and the internal project management arrangements that were put in place, was it not seen at some point that the costs were going to balloon?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In the context of similar ventures and projects that the RTB is going to undertake, can I presume lessons have been learned on how to manage such large scale projects?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, and a costly one.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Let us keep an eye on that cost as well.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the RTB and the database, what analysis has been conducted to identify landlords who have unregistered tenancies? Has there been any analysis done to identify landlords who are no longer registered with the RTB? Ms Gallagher made reference to the quarterly reports undertaken by the RTB. Does that body of work include an analysis of landlords who are not registered or who are no longer registered with the RTB?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	From my experience, there is a bit of a lacuna here although it is not a policy issue that the RTB can address. If a legal entity is managing or letting properties, there does not seem to be the same ability in the RTB to pursue, monitor or enforce rules. Legal entities may change their names and continue trading under different names but are not in keeping with the spirit of the legislation that is meant to manage tenancies in a proper fashion. I know I am being vague here but I have written to the RTB about it, as has a concerned constituent of mine. My colleague in the constituency will be aware of a certain case. We need to analyse all types of tenancies to ensure that they can come under the remit of the RTB. I also want to ask about the extent of knowledge of tenancies and the sharing of information with the Revenue Commissioners under section 148. To what extent is that information being shared by the RTB? Is that updated regularly through the database or how is it done?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I noticed in the RTB's financial statements that there was an excessively large increase in expenditure on High Court appeals. Why is that the case? In 2019, such expenditure amounted to approximately €38,500 but in 2020 it jumped to €264,720. Can Mr. Byrne explain that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was there a jump in the number of cases or did a particular case cause the jump in expenditure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is a significant rise.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand that. I ask Mr. Byrne to send us a note on that because it jumped off the page at me.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is an extremely large increase. Mr. Byrne said in his opening remarks regarding unregistered tenancies or even those that are registered, that if they are not in compliance with the RTB it can take action and pursue them through the courts or by other means. If he does not have the information to hand today, I ask him to send on to the committee data on the number of those types of cases that the RTB pursues on an annual basis. What remedies are open to the RTB if a landlord ignores, post-mediation, an adjudication from the RTB or health and safety recommendations relating to a property? Likewise, what remedies are available if a tenant has received mediation and ignores it too? What options are open to the RTB?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will focus on the financial statements and I have a number of questions about them, the first of which relates to customer contacts. The RTB spent €2.3 million in 2019. That reduced slightly to €2.2 million in 2020. The documentation notes that customer contacts costs relate to a third-party service company which provides customer contact through telephone, web chat and email, and administrative services to the RTB's customers.It seems a lot of money is being spent on outsourcing this service. I note Ms Gallagher's comments about the web chat, and I presume social media is included in this if it is not done in-house. Will Mr. Byrne outline what exactly this company is doing for that large sum of money?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is it an annual contract?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Sorry, I am just conscious of time. If I can, then-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The RTB spent €16,500 on subscriptions. I note it reduced during the pandemic. What are those subscriptions for?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Kelly might send a note, if he would not mind, please. I note the stenographer and translation headings. I can understand the reduction in costs of the stenographer, given the pandemic. In terms of translation, however, if the RTB's online services continued, why is there a reduction in translation services? Surely, I would have thought that would have roughly been the same, but it seems to be quite a reduction.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The RTB had 753 unresolved cases but it made no provision for them. I understand Mr. Kelly said the costs would vary greatly in those, but there is no provision made at all in the financial accounts in 2020. Is that wise given the discrepancy there could be for the RTB's accounts for next year? This is 5(b), section 14 on page 41 of the financial statements. It says the board had 753 dispute resolution cases awaiting hearing as of 31 December 2020. As the cost of the dispute resolution process varies greatly from case to case, no provision is being made for unresolved cases registered prior to the 31 December 2020.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would they normally be of that magnitude?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I can just foresee as Mr. Kelly sitting here next year - I am sure he is looking forward to it already - accounting for the accounts and realising that perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General or we might highlight it, given there was no provision at all made for it. I do not think that is right. There should be a given provision for it in light of the number of cases.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to ask about the CDETB. The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned a figure of a little over €2 million as regards non-compliance with the procurement rules. What kind of non-compliance issues did he discover?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I see.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Which can happen.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That makes sense for the individual centres as well. I thank Mr. McCarthy for that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Noted.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree with the comments of the previous speakers. We must get more information anyway from it. The article was very serious and concerning, particularly the commentary that was used and quoted in the article of 13 February. In that vein, I welcome the clarity of this letter, particularly about the actual sum initially sought by the HSE, which was €35 million. While the agreed budget was €37 million, there was an additional €10 million allocated. In terms of the clarity in respect of recruitment, we know on this committee from across the country the challenge of recruitment that is faced by industry anyway, let alone in the public sector. It is helpful that this correspondence has set the record straight, but the tone and some of the commentary of that article are concerning to say the least.Therefore the letter itself should be published and we should seek further information, as has been requested already. Then we can take it up with the Department and the HSE the next time they are before the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I want to raise an area I had mentioned before, namely, the Dublin Dental Hospital. It is a long time since it was before the committee. I forget how long. Maybe the clerk or the Mr. McCarthy can say.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is what thought. I thought we had discussed that previously. Given the length of time, I suggest that 24 March be offered to them.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No, I had flagged it when we were going through the list of organisations last September or October. It was given the fact that it had not been here before. I take Deputy Catherine Murphy's point but we might look to see if it is a possibility if there space. The Chairman suggested Horse Racing Ireland. I have no problem with either but if there is a space, we should consider it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, there is an issue nationally. It is not just with it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept what the Comptroller and Auditor General has said. It has a specific remit. I accept what the Chair said about the midlands. You could say that about any area in the country, in fairness, and it is the same for Dublin. I accept the Comptroller and Auditor General's points. If we were to include it with either the Department of Health or the HSE, in tandem as co-witnesses, that would be fine. We specifically put it on the work programme so that it was not forgotten and it is something that we should explore. The Comptroller and Auditor General is correct that it was about procurement concerns at the time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I do not think that we wrote to them. I think it was more that it was flagged at the time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I can do that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, that is fine.
