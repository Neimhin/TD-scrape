CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for attending. I apologise for missing the opening remarks. I was in the Chamber. I apologise if I am going over old ground. I think the Department's response to an intense crisis in a short time was exemplary. I acknowledge the questions of my colleagues about reviews and ensuring that public money was spent wisely. I note what the Comptroller and Auditor General said a moment ago. I think it is right to say that the majority of businesses applied because they needed the funding to keep their companies afloat or in abeyance for the period of the pandemic. The feedback that I have got has been positive. The engagement by the Department was excellent. I will start from that basis. It is important that we review the money and the various grants.God forbid that we are in another similar situation and we have to respond quickly. We are obviously going to need to learn from the various situations and the grant systems we put in place. The local enterprise offices, LEOs, were excellent and the fact we had that local network and an ability to channel money out to businesses, some of which we had been engaging with already, was very important. I commend all the local authorities and other organisations on their work. In the Department’s briefing note, at part 3, on page 16, a point of interest to me was the funding in regard to the European Space Agency. How much is Ireland contributing to that? I note that, in 2020, 87 Irish companies were under active contract with the European Space Agency, representing a 45% increase in activity since 2016, which is very good to see. Some €13.3 million in contracts was won by Irish industry from the European Space Agency just last year. Will Dr. Quinn comment on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Excuse me, did I miss the figure of how much we have contributed to the European Space Agency? Is that an annual set amount or does it change?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As I said, it is a point of interest to me. In terms of the restart grants, in particular the restart grant plus, does the Department have a timeframe for when the review might be carried out and how it might be carried out? Will it be done at a local level through the LEOs or through the funding organisations, or will it be done through the Department? When will it be done? My second question, which is not related to the Covid grants, is in regard to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, inspectors. This is covered in part 4 of the briefing note from the Department, which was very helpful and very informative. There were 10,295 workplace inspections and investigations carried out in 2020, with 9,135 inspections which addressed occupational safety and health issues. Given our discussion earlier about the number of premises that were not open during 2021, how many inspections were carried out? I know the HSA was involved in many of the health and safety checks in certain industries over the course of the pandemic.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Before Dr. Quinn comes back in on the HSA question, where fraudulent or inappropriate claims have been made or found, what recourse is open to the Department in that regard and what would the Department do to try to seek the return of those funds?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be a fivefold increase, effectively, on the 2020 figures, given all of the various new inspectors that have been brought in or drafted in for the purpose of inspections during the pandemic. Is that correct?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Thank you.
