CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank our witnesses for their opening remarks at their responses. I apologise for my delay because I am attending another committee at the same time. I thank Mr. Justice Mahon for the presentation and for the answers he has given. I want to touch on a few items if I may. Perhaps these questions have been answered already but I would appreciate responses to them. I was looking at the number of complaints in the various annual reports from 2017 right through to 2020. To take one figure in isolation, which stood out to me, is the Air Corps. The figures are broken down, and maladministration is a category in the 2017 to 2018 report. There are 18 cases. I am unsure as to whether they are initial complaints or if they are complaints that went through an initial process and then went on to be investigated. In 2019, again for the Air Corps, the category of maladministration cases dropped to eight and in 2020 to two cases. Without drilling into every category in every single aspect of the Defence Forces, will Mr Justice Mahon elaborate please on why there was such a high figure? Was that report amalgamated between 2017 and 2018? Even if so, it is still higher than the previous years. I will lead with this question first please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am going to discuss some of the statistics from the annual report in a few moments. Will Mr. Justice Mahon give the committee an overall breakdown of the complaints from a gender perspective? Have there been more complaints over the years from females than there have been from males? What about over the past 12 months? Does Mr. Justice Mahon have that figure? Does he have a breakdown of the numbers of complaints received from serving members and retired members?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. Justice Mahon give a note to the committee containing a breakdown of those complaints by gender and the numbers of complainants who are retired and the numbers who are still serving? I heard what he said about the lacuna between the time a member is serving and when they transition into retirement. However, it might be of interest to the committee, particularly in the context of our report, if there were such a breakdown.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Justice Mahon answered a question from one of my colleagues a little while ago relating to the "Women of Honour" programme, which brought to light a worrying trend or culture that may have existed within the Defence Forces. I heard what Mr. Justice Mahon said about the 2004 Act, which gives him the powers to carry out his role. The customer charter quotes section 4(2)(b)(vi) of the Act, referring to an occasion where the subject of a complaint was an action that was "unreasonable, notwithstanding consideration of the context of the military environment". Section 4(2)(c) refers to an action that "was not an order issued in the course of a military operation". Section 6(3) of the Act states, "A complainant shall make a complaint referred to in subsections (1) and (2) not later than 12 months". I heard Mr. Justice Mahon say the content of "Women of Honour" fell outside of his jurisdiction unless there was legislative change. Is there a willingness or a desire on the part of serving members, in particular, to come forward or is there a reluctance to come forward to the ombudsman with complaints?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there a fear factor? I am wondering if we are seeing the true volume.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It does, and Mr. Justice Mahon is right about the internal process. If people have already taken that step, it would be no harm for them to go on to the ombudsman if they are not satisfied with the internal resolution of the case. That is fine. Does Mr. Justice Mahon also look at complaints from those in the Reserve Defence Force?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If Mr. Justice Mahon is going to send a note containing figures to the committee after the meeting, I would ask him to include the figures for the Reserve Defence Force. That would be of interest to me. It is an important figure.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would a rough estimate, to which I will not hold Mr. Justice Mahon, be that 80% of the complaints come from serving members, 10% from the Reserve Defence Force and 10% from retired members? Would retired members comprise even 10% of complaints?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is all right. We are not going to hold Mr. Justice Mahon to his figures.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Justice Mahon spoke of his recommendations a short while ago, and that the Defence Forces have taken those on board, which is good news. Is there a follow-up on the recommendations Mr. Justice Mahon makes? Are there checks and balances from his own office? Does he have the resources to do that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course it can, yes. In his opening statement, Mr. Justice Mahon mentioned the fact that in excess of 95% of new referrals are fully investigated and reported on within four weeks. When he said "reported on", did that mean those cases are investigated and a response has issued to the complainant or did it mean an internal report has been compiled?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I think it is a remarkable timeframe. For 95% of the cases to be dealt with in that timeframe is very impressive, I must say. It is probably appreciated by those who are making the complaints, because they know where they stand after that investigation. Finally, I wish to turn to the issue of Women of Honour. In Mr. Justice Mahon's opening statement, he mentioned other jurisdictions, such as Austria, Canada, Germany, Norway and South Africa. Perhaps the ombudsmen in those jurisdictions come across similar issues of serving female members of their defence forces or armies. Changes could be made to the 2004 Act to give the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces more powers to investigate those complaints or at least have another avenue for individuals to come to the office with allegations of sexual complaints, intimidation or anything else. Is that something that other jurisdictions have, or other ombudsmen have in those jurisdictions? How does the ombudsman see the best avenue for those individuals to make a complaint? Is it through an ombudsman-style office, or a different course of action that is taken in other jurisdictions?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is something we might consider in terms of our own recommendations as a committee, subsequently. I thank Mr. Justice Mahon and Mr. O'Neill for their attendance and for their answers to the questions of the committee members.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The ombudsman referenced the special reports that may be done by his office and they perhaps come from the route from the Minister's office. How many special reports has the ombudsman's office completed since its foundation in 2005? Does Mr. Justice Mahon know how many special reports have been completed or have there been any?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Justice Mahon might send a note on that, please, if he would not mind. Sticking with the December 2005 date from when cases could be taken, were there any cases that pre-dated 2005? I accept this pre-dates Mr. Justice Mahon's time. If there were such cases and assuming they would have fallen into the scope of the work of the ombudsman had they been post December 2005, what happened to those individuals, have they been left in limbo, and have there been many of them?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If the office has any information on that, it would of interest to me. I say that because if we are looking at legislation and the power that gives the office that right, we need to be sure about this issue. I would not like to think there are cases from before 2005 that have been declined on the basis of the date of the complaint. I note the ombudsman said he is excluded from investigating certain matters such as structures, the deployment of Defence Forces, and terms and conditions of employment. Why is the conciliation and arbitration scheme specifically excluded or is that just something Mr. Justice Mahon highlighted in his presentation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. I thank Mr. Justice Mahon and look forward to his note.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Agreed.
