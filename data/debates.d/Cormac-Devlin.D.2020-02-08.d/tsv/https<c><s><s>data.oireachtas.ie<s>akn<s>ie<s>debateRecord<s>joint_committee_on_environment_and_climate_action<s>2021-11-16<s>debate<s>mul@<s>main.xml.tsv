CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am conscious of the Minister's time. I apologise; I had problems with the broadband here in the office, but I am on the campus. I ask the Minister about his comments about microgeneration and selling back to the grid. When does he hope that individual properties will be able to avail of that type of scheme? The Minister touched on energy security earlier. I ask him to elaborate further on the two interconnectors which are due on stream by 2027 if I am not mistaken.
