CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Minister is aware that many doctors signed up to category A consultant contracts during the early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic. Alongside their colleagues in the health sector they were on the front line throughout the pandemic. We in the House are extremely grateful for all of their efforts. Will the Minister provide an update on the progress to date of the incremental credit applications for these doctors? I know this issue is somewhat complex and has been going on for quite some time but they would be very grateful for any indication of when it is expected to be finalised.
