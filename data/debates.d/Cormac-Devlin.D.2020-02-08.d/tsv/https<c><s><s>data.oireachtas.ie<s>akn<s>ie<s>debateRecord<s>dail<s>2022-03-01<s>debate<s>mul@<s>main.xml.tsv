CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Taoiseach for his update on work of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, particularly with regard to climate and biodiversity, housing and the shared island initiative. Like all Deputies across this House, I have been appalled by the war of aggression being waged by Russia and now, it would appear, Belarus, against the people of Ukraine. News last week that the Irish visa requirements will be lifted is very welcome, as is the €10 million relief fund. Families in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire are making arrangements to host friends and family from Ukraine. Will the Taoiseach provide an update on Ireland's short- and medium-term plans to accommodate people fleeing Ukraine? Will he appoint a Minister to co-ordinate efforts?

CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Taoiseach for his update on the implementation of his Department's Strategy Statement 2021-2023. This morning, the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made an impassioned plea to the European Parliament during which he called for support from his European neighbours as his country resists Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine. It is disappointing to see reports of a number of Irish MEPs, including Mick Wallace, Clare Daly, Luke 'Ming' Flanagan and Sinn Féin's Chris MacManus, supporting an amendment before the European Parliament that would delay Ukraine's accession to the EU. Will the Taoiseach advise whether Ireland will support Ukraine's accession to the EU and indicate what practical supports Ireland can give as the Ukrainian people fight for their lives and their independence?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I concur and support much of what has been said by my colleague, Deputy Lahart. Like all Deputies across this House, the Irish people and almost everyone around the world, have been shocked and truly appalled by the illegal war of aggression being waged by Russia and now Belarus on the people of Ukraine. The war is a clear breach of the United Nations Charter. It is causing untold suffering for the people of Ukraine and it is creating a human catastrophe in Europe. Over 650,000 Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, families have been split, people have lost everything. We are hearing stories of men in particular being asked to remain, choosing fighting over their families. It churns the stomach of the Irish people that this could happen again on the Continent of Europe when we thought we were living in a time of peace. Russia’s prosecution of the war has been appalling. The use of cluster munitions and other weapons on an indiscriminate basis against residential areas constitutes war crimes. These crimes must be investigated. I support the calls of other Deputies in that regard. The international community and particularly the European Union cannot stand idly by while a democratic state with a rich cultural and social history is snuffed out.  I welcome multilateral sanctions against the Russian regime by the EU and other nations. I welcome commitments today by several party leaders across the House with regard to the need to facilitate Ukraine’s membership of the EU. Efforts earlier today by some Irish MEPs to frustrate the process for reasons known only to them were bizarre and shameful. On a practical basis, Ireland should do everything it can to assist the people of Ukraine in their hour of need. I welcome the lifting of visa requirements for Ukrainians coming to Ireland, the establishment of a relief fund and plans to support Ukrainians fleeing to Ireland in a special refugee programme. Efforts by individuals and groups across Ireland should also be acknowledged.  It would be remiss not to recognise those brave Russian citizens who have come out to protest the illegal war against their neighbours in Ukraine. Like all of us, they are disgusted. I support this motion. It demonstrates the resolve of this House and the Irish people. Even at this late stage, like all Members of the House, I would like to see Russia and Belarus do the right thing. They can and should do that.
