CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our witnesses. I send my best wishes to the Secretary General. I will start with the school building programme. I heard Mr. Loftus say that 700 active sites had been acquired since 2021. Is that correct?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. Loftus outline for the committee the number of stages of acquisition, planning and, ultimately, construction? How many stages are there from site acquisition through to construction?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That may be a matter for another question.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	All I wanted to know was the number of stages. Mr. Loftus referred to five stages. Is that for acquisition and construction or acquisition and planning?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	At times, there does not appear to be a continued focus on the various stages. Other Deputies have raised issues in their constituencies. I represent Dún Laoghaire and I am aware of a particular school which has been in prefabricated units on-site since 2005. The State pays for the upkeep and maintenance of the prefabs annually. About three years ago, one of the prefabs was condemned. We thought that was wonderful because the prefabs would be moved, but instead the State purchased or rented another prefab. The school has been on this temporary site for about 27 years, although the Department owns it. Mr. Loftus outlined five stages, which sound quite simple, but I know it is complex. The Department probably selects land owned by the council or State land first and then if that is not available, it seeks to acquire land, if possible. I am sure Mr. Loftus will agree that 27 years is a long time to spend in prefabs. It has an impact on the school, although not on the quality of education, which is excellent. It has an impact when people visit it. When will the prefabs be replaced or when will there be a permanent building? I will come back to that in a second. The Department had capital expenditure of €4.1 billion in 2021. Some €165 million was spent on temporary accommodation, according to the briefing note supplied to us. Some €29.4 million was spent on renting temporary accommodation. Does €165 million include the €29.4 million or is that in addition to it? I know those are not all prefabs and that temporary accommodation could include other things. Do the witnesses have a figure for how much the Department spent on prefabricated units in the period we are discussing, which is 2021? Does the €165 million for temporary accommodation include the €29.4 million for temporary rental accommodation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that. Of the €29.4 million, I am not saying that all of that is in respect of prefabricated units that are there for long-term accommodation but how much of it is reoccurring? I mean prefabricated units that are being used on a continuous basis as either a school or an extension to a school. Does the Department have that figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I figured that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that. That review is helpful and it is good to know it has been done, particularly from the perspective of this committee. What about the 8% of that figure? Where do those schools stand?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is all very important. The demographics of those areas can speak to why there is spare capacity. I ask the Department to look at the building I mentioned from 2005 and follow up with a detailed note please. The roll number is 20056P. Finally, there is a small extension that began in a school with the roll number 19258U. It started in August 2019. It is overdue by 12 to 14 months. The school has tried to engage with the Department and the contractor. Principals are becoming project managers here. Many of them do not have the time, resources or the skill set to do this. Yet the Department is paying a contractor to do work but the contractor is not on site. In such instances, what can the Department do to ensure the contract is done and dusted and that ultimately kids can go into that classroom? What happens then?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chair. I might come back in.
