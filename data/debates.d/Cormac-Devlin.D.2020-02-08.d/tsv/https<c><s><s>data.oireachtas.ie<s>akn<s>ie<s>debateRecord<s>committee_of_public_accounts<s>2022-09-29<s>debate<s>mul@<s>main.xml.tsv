CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Reid and the officials. I thank them for coming in. I am not sure if this will be his final appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, but I thank him for the information he provided and all the engagement we have had in the past couple of years, particularly during the pandemic. At the time, he gave significant time to this committee and other Oireachtas committees, and that was appreciated. I will turn to the issue of CHO 4 as it is specifically on the agenda and Mr. Fitzgerald is here to answer questions. How many children have been involved in the review in CHO 4, particularly in respect of south Kerry, but also in north Kerry and the rest of the CHO area? On the most recent occasion Mr. Reid was before the committee, I asked what actions had been taken to engage with the affected families, and the children in particular, some of whom are now adolescents, to review their medical needs and mental health needs. Has that work been completed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that, but how long did it take for that process to start and the engagement to happen? We are talking months.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for that. In terms of the children's medication and an assessment of need for each family, has that all been done as well as liaising with each of those 240 individuals?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does the assessment include medication?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for this clarification. I now want to turn to the OECD report that accompanied the briefing documents. There is some very good reading in it. We had an extremely successful vaccination programme with the co-operation and support of the general public. It is stated that 70% of the population received two doses. Does Dr. Reid have an update on the second booster? What is the uptake of this? How is the roll-out going?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does this include the older cohort as well as those at risk? There has been an advertising campaign for those at risk. Mr. Reid said there has been a slower uptake. Does he have a rough percentage?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The HSE is right to look at other facilities such as pharmacies and GPs to support the roll-out programme and make it easier for people to access it. We do not know what the winter will hold. Is there a possibility of engaging outreach services for larger employers where employees will be based? I know it was not possible during the pandemic for obvious reasons but is this being considered? Will the advertising campaign be used to try to encourage people to go to vaccination centres and other healthcare centres?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask the witnesses to forward the table. It would be very helpful to the committee. On the previous occasion we spoke about this we discussed cybersecurity. The attack was in May 2021 and in November 2021 the HSE sanctioned taking on a chief risk officer. Has this role been filled?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The consultancy firm is liaising.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is ongoing.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In the annual report risk No. 13 specifically highlighted the cybersecurity ICT systems and infrastructure. With regard to the spend I hear what has been said about the roles being filled but they are individuals and the leads in this area. What other issues and commitments has the HSE made to ensure its ICT capabilities are up to scratch given that on the previous occasion we engaged on this I raised the issue of ICT, laptops and software? We were buying patches for computers. One year later have we moved on from discussing this?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand. I do not want detail.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is the HSE working towards having a more integrated system in the five to seven year plan?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses.
