CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for my delay in engaging with the witnesses. I welcome them back. It is good to engage again. I will focus on one specific area, namely, the inputting of one's own data on the various portals supplied by the utility companies. Has the CRU had any complaints about the effectiveness of some of the portals? Some of them appear to be down. I have got information into my office here regarding the experience of some people who have gone to submit meter readings, especially around a deadline before Christmas when people were asked to submit their readings before a certain date to avail of lower tariffs. When they did go to do that a day or two before the deadline, some websites were down. Is this something that has come to the attention of the CRU? If so, what has and can be done about this? I have received quite a number of queries regarding this matter since our last engagement and I thought I would raise it here.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This was a particular pinch point for obvious reasons in respect of the tariffs changing. I have since had queries, however, about these portals being down. There is the ESB Networks' portal as well, but regarding the suppliers themselves it is important these services are maintained. This is why I am asking the regulator about this. It is something the CRU seems to be aware of. What can be done about it? A note might be sent to the committee with a response in terms of the extent to which the organisation is aware of this issue. Obviously, it would not be aware of the minute issues that the customer care service teams of the various utility companies would be aware of, but for those cases the CRU is aware of, I would like a note to be prepared for the committee and circulated after this engagement. That would be appreciated.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. It is good to hear about the progress being made with the smart meters. It seems there has been quite a bit of progress made since our last engagement. It was projected that we would be around this point at this time, but it is good to hear concrete evidence that half, or more than half, of customers have availed of these smart meters. This is very good. I thank the witnesses again for their engagement today and for their opening statement.
