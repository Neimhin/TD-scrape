CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Deputy Cahill for placing the NDP on the agenda. In respect of Dublin and questions over the MetroLink, I ask that it be prioritised in the NDP review, as well as DART underground. These are key infrastructure projects that were mooted previously and need to be retained on the agenda, as does the N11 interchange. Finally, coastal defence is required for Dublin Bay and that could perhaps be linked with the Sutton to Sandycove walkway and cycleway. All the projects are essential for Dublin and its expansion.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I commend the Minister on initiating the review of the national lottery, which I believe is long overdue. When is it due to be completed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I note the figures the Minister gave for Ireland. In the UK, approximately 53% of every £1 spent goes to the prize funds, 25% goes to good causes, 12% goes to the UK Government as duty, 4% goes to the retailers and 5% goes to the operator, with 4% of that 5% for operating costs and 1% of it for profits. The Minister mentioned €6 billion for good causes in this country. What percentage of sales in the Irish system goes to good causes, prize funds, State levies and the operator? I appreciate the Minister might not have that information with him this morning, but he might forward it to me. While I know funds go to good causes in various sectors such as sport, culture, heritage, the arts, youth, welfare and amenities, can the Minister give the House an indication, or arrange to send us that information as well, of how much was allocated to each of those sectors?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate the fact that the review is taking place. I am not sure if a review of this scale has been undertaken since 1987 so it is very important. The Minister highlighted the example of the sports clubs. All Members of the House have been contacted by sports clubs, community organisations and others that are eager to access any type of funding, but there has to be a clear pathway to that funding. It is very generous funding but we must have transparency. We discussed freedom of information earlier, so it is important that there is transparency in respect of funding for all the good causes that the national lottery has funded over the years and will fund in the future.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is the Tánaiste aware of the alarming trend of urban post offices closing and the impact this is having on communities? In that past year alone in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency, Monkstown and Foxrock post offices have closed. Residents in Dalkey were told this week that their local post office will be closing on Friday, 8 October, and that the postmaster is retiring after 14 years of service. On a personal note, I wish Christopher Good all the very best in his retirement and thank him and his staff for all the work they have done. An Post has advised that it is trying to get another post office into Dalkey but despite its best efforts, it has had no such luck to date. Dalkey is a town of almost 7,000 residents, on a par with Tuam, Ballinasloe and New Ross. It would be unthinkable for such a large town to lose its post office. I note that the programme for Government commits to maintaining the national post office network. Can the Tánaiste advise the House what the Government is doing to retain post offices in urban and rural areas? We do not want to lose any more of them.
