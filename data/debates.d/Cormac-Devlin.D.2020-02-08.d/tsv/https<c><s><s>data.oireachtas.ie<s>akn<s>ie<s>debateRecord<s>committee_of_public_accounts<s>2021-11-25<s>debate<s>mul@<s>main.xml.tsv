CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Ms Licken and her team. It is good to see many of them at the Committee of Public Accounts. At the outset, I want to refer to the breadth of her organisation. Ms Licken referred to it in her own opening remarks. I note some members have focused in on RTÉ and others on the European Capital of Culture 2020. I will touch on a number of other elements within both the accounts and other areas. The first I wanted to touch on was something I raised on the previous occasion we engaged, and that was around the television licence. Obviously, things have changed in terms of the pandemic and the need for inspectors to do other work. For how long were the television inspectors suspended from their ordinary work during the course of the pandemic? What impact did that suspension of television licence inspections have on the collection rate of 2020 and 2021? That will be my first question.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On that point, it is the first time I have heard them referred to as "sales". I do not know if the people who pay them would exactly classify them as sales. In terms of the money that has not been collected, is there a plan to try to collect that at some point?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is a collection agent. Okay, that is fine.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Decade of Centenaries is something we have engaged previously on. In terms of the specific projects that the Department is engaged with, can Ms Licken give us an outline of expenditure to date on that topic?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am familiar with a number of those projects. Ms Licken is correct. It is very important and I recognise Ms Licken's Department's involvement in that. In terms of expenditure, do we have a figure of how much has been allocated or spent to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The witnesses might send us a note on it, if they would not mind.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course. They are hampered too. I accept that. I see Ms Banotti there. We spoke previously about Creative Ireland. Since we last spoke, I want to commend the work, particularly in the 24 DEIS schools on Fighting Words, that programme that was very well received, as well as the creative youth projects and others. It is important to acknowledge that work. Mr. Falvey mentioned the local authorities. It is important that there is good collaboration between the Department and Creative Ireland, and I thank them for that. Turning to the appropriation account, there is a note here about six contracts to the value of €578,000 for non-compliance. The majority of that was cleaning and other utility contracts. However, the sixth one relates to genealogy services in the National Archives of Ireland and it has now been re-tendered. Could Ms Licken outline what happened in that regard? There are nine other contracts as well but I will get on to that in a second.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. I await the note on that. I apologise, as I have limited time. There is a note as well on the procedures and control changes within the Department as a result of Covid-19. Ms Licken specifically mentioned risk register details, and controls and actions needed to mitigate risks and assign responsibilities for co-operation and controls to staff. Has that process been concluded now? Is it correct that those new roles have been assigned within the Department?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In my remaining time, I commend the work of the Department, specifically in the sports sector and the response to it, especially the €85 million that was allocated to sporting bodies. It is important that we acknowledge the quick response of the Department in a short period to the various organisations. I presume that I have used all my time, but I hope to get back in later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I want to come back to the sports elements because that is where we left off when I was last speaking. I agree with Deputies Paul McAuliffe, Alan Dillon and Colm Burke on the issues around large-scale infrastructure and other grants. If I heard the witnesses correctly, it was said that with regard to the grants for sporting bodies and provision of sports and recreational facilities, that underspend was as a result of challenges faced by the clubs in trying to spend that money but it is still earmarked for them and they are not going to lose the funding. Is that right?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. With regard to part C, the capital grant programme part of the appropriation accounts, there seems to have been a significant increase in grants cancelled, from the figures for 2019. Can Ms Licken elaborate on the rationale for those cancelled grants?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is section C in the appropriation accounts on page 15. It is at subhead 2.9 on commitments.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Department might come back to me on that or send a note.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	To stick with the appropriation accounts, under subhead 2.4 on prepayments, there seems to have been a reduction in expenditure on the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030. Can Ms Licken explain what that is about and why there is such a dramatic reduction in that expenditure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is not a loss.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is okay. In theory, the same money allocated to that programme is going to be there and it just has not been spent. Is that what we are saying?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wanted to get clarity on that in order to be sure. The recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General states: “The Department should put in place robust controls to ensure compliance of future grantees with relevant grant management and reporting requirements”. I note the Department accepts that recommendation. How is it going to be implemented?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Licken might revert to me on the question relating to the cancellation of grants, whether by note after the meeting or towards the end of the meeting.
