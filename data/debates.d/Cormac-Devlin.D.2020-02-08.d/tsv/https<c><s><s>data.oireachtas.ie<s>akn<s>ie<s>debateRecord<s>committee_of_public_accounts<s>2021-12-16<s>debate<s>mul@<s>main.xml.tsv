CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our witnesses. It is good to engage again following our previous engagement in July. I will stay on the children's hospital and follow up on some of my questions in July. It is clear that we will not get a copy of the report. To an extent, I appreciate why not. When the committee visited the site, it was clear there were all sorts of claims, some of which were legitimate in theory because the design of the project had changed. I can appreciate that. However, Mr. Watt must realise that we, as the Committee on Public Accounts, are very interested, as I am sure he and other Secretaries General, as to what the final cost will be. As I have said previously, this is an essential project. We are in, whether we like it or not. We need a new state-of-the-art children's hospital. However, the Committee on Public Accounts would like to know even a guesstimate of costs.Regardless of what the report states, it would be helpful to give a ballpark figure to this committee, and ultimately to the public, to say how much the project may cost, subject to legal fees and other charges. Will Mr. Watt give an indication of what percentage of the project is complete?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What percentage of the project is complete?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	So, assuming from that - let us call it €1.7 billion so far - that if there is about 40% of the project yet to run, which includes fit-out costs and everything else, would Mr. Watt agree it could be in and around €2.2 billion or would he even give a figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	So Mr. Watt will not give even a guesstimate as to what he thinks the final cost may be?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does the report give an estimate as to what the final cost would be?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I can understand that but-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the basis that it is 50% to 60% completed, with the vast bulk of the construction and the outer skin of the building complete, which the committee saw, and obviously progress has continued from July onwards, was there built into the contract or was any foresight given to rising inflation costs? Were any materials or products pre-purchased at any point during this construction phase to try to bring down the cost, or are they being purchased at the point of need?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Watt is not sure and is not sure to the quantity either. I can appreciate that the board would probably have more detail on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I imagine they would. How often is the Department's engagement with the national children's hospital board? Is this monthly, weekly, or biweekly?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I note from the documentation Mr. Watt supplied to the committee, which is helpful, that he gives an estimate of around 2024 as the completion date for this project. Does this include the two satellite centres?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am aware that one is complete but will they both be completed by 2024 or even before 2024?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be helpful. Analysis was done by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board. In an email to the committee, I note that Mr. Watt stated that the analysis was not in relation to the progress of the national paediatric hospital but it related to forecasting of critical paths and scenarios for the optimal completion of the project. What exactly does Mr. Watt mean by that? Is that in relation to the completion of the overall project or to the actual construction of the project, or both?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there anything that stands out to Mr. Watt from the analysis that he would like to share with the committee that he believes could be a big stumbling block to the completion, where it could be extended even beyond 2024?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is something I said to the hospital board and to Mr. Watt's Department in July. I believe that the scale of the project needs to be another element of explaining the sheer scale of this plan.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have other questions but I will not get the time on them, so I will turn to the legal costs for the Department. With regard to the MDU refusal, there are departmental legal costs in excess of €1.6 million, which is extraordinary. Is that the Medical Defence Union? That case has been rumbling on for quite some time. What has been going on for longer, and is quite frightening from my perspective, are the legal costs for the Department in the thalidomide case. Is that the case that has been going on since 2010? I am conscious that there are only a handful of survivors left of this case. These are the second ever largest legal costs for the Department, as were stated in the 2020 accounts. Will Mr. Watt please clarify both of those items?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does that then explain the elevated costs?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Can I just ask-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. Watt clarify both figures for the MDU and the thalidomide case? Could he outline why the thalidomide case is the second largest legal cost of the Department at this point, given the case has been running on for 11 years or more?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. Watt please clarify both figures that were in the 2020 accounts for MDU and the thalidomide case?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, the Department's legal costs.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the two headings, please. I think they have been broken down but I do not have the details to hand.
