CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their opening statements and for the information provided to the committee in advance. I will start with the escrow fund. I note Mr. O'Kelly's comments in his opening statement. The total net assets in the fund decreased by an alarming €36 million in 2020 and, I think, €16 million in 2019. That brings the fund to €13.98 billion, which is approximately 87.6% of its original value. The matters before the European courts may take a few years - and Mr. O'Kelly might offer his own opinion on that - but in terms of the exposure for the State, if this were to decrease further or go on for a number of years does Mr. O'Kelly estimate the amount in the fund dropping further? Is there an exposure to the State if the fund is not managed and is decreasing in value all the time? There is an equal relationship between Apple and the NTMA in managing the fund. I ask Mr. O'Kelly to comment on that matter.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms O'Halloran for that. I presume, given that answer, that the NTMA will be back before the committee and we will be discussing escrow several times between now and a final determination by the European courts. Is there any liability for the State if the fund goes below a certain level? I accept that the NTMA is looking for a return, and it is not for investment purposes but just to manage the fund, but if that fund were to continue to fall, is there any stipulation in the agreement that there is any further liability to the State?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Kelly for that clarity. I think the annual operating charge is €7 million per annum. It is a fixed charge, if I understand correctly. Will the witnesses elaborate on that? What does the charge entail and who effectively is administrating it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, and €7 million between four entities is not too bad either on an annual basis, but that is a different day's work. As for the 2019 financial statements, there was a withholding tax of €2 million. Will the witnesses elaborate on that tax, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms O'Halloran for the clarity on that. I have one last question about the escrow fund. I note that there is a formal investment meeting or deliberation in November and that there was another one in 2019, if I am not mistaken. The use of the word "formal" suggests there are informal, ongoing discussions or meetings regarding this fund. Can one of the witnesses elaborate on that element, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Kelly for that. The following questions may relate to Mr. Breen of the State Claims Agency, or somebody else may answer them. I note that there were 12,175 active claims by the end of 2020. That was a 5% increase on the figure for 2019, with an estimated total of €4 billion in potential liability. Can somebody give a breakdown sector by sector? I note there was some breakdown. I think it was 92% for Tusla and the Department of Health and, I think, 6% encompassing the Departments of Justice, Defence and Education. Is there a breakdown of that 92% between the Department of Health and Tusla? Do the witnesses have that with them?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, please. It would be helpful for all the various sectors. I know it has been broken down for us but it would be nice to see it broken down further. From the initial establishment in 2012, I think the liability at that stage stood at about €1 billion, so we have increased it rapidly over the years. What is the main reason for those continuous increases year on year, bearing in mind, as I said, that we had a 5% increase from 2019?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Breen. I note that 53% of the cases were resolved in 2020 without court proceedings being instigated, which is worthy of compliment. Mediation forms a large part of this. What other steps are being taken to reduce the liability and the number of claims year on year by the NTMA and the individual Departments and State agencies concerned?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman for allowing us to come back in again. I will follow up on my earlier question on the need for further information about the breakdown of claims. Mr. Breen is going to supply that to the committee. That relates to 92% for Tusla and the Department of Health, and 6% for the Departments of Justice, Defence and Education. I will ask about the post office savings bank fund. I note two contracts exist, one for An Post and one for Fexco. What is the administrative cost of these contracts? I do not know if Mr. O'Kelly will give that figure if it is commercially sensitive, but I would appreciate it if he could.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Connor for that. On the post office deposit account for savings, I note that in 2011 it was €2.5 billion and it has risen to approximately €3.4 billion or €3.5 billion. Given the past year and a half we have had, does Mr. O'Connor expect that to rise higher than normal? What is his perception of the year ahead?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the post office savings bank fund and the investments therein, 61% of it was loans to the Exchequer but 15% of it was investments. What kind of investments are they? What is the mainstay of those?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. That is very clear. I thank Mr. O'Connor for that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his contribution. Procurement issues arise time and again with all sets of accounts. The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned that some non-compliant procurement was in excess of €500,000. He also identified other issues relating to the prison and Garda Votes. Can he go into any specifics or any more detail on that? Are any of the organisations the Comptroller and Auditor General has highlighted on our work programme? Are we going to be engaging with them in the foreseeable future, over the next six to eight months?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Four organisations are non-compliant by more than €5 million. The Comptroller and Auditor General also highlighted the OPW contract that has been extended well past its sell-by date. Perhaps we can reconcile that with our work programme and see if we cannot bring those organisations in. That is not small change by any stretch of the imagination. It is a lot of money and we need to examine the position.
