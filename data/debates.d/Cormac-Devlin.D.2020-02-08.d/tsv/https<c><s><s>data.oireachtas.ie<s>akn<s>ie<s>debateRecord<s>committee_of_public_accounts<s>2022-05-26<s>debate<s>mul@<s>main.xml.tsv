CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their opening remarks. I would like to touch on a number of areas. I will be brief in order to get through them in the limited time available to me. To touch on the issue of assessment of needs that we were discussing a little while ago, the redesign in the HSE that is being spoken of is welcome, but a definitive timeframe for when that will be published would also be welcome. I heard Ms O'Connor's remarks about the focus on the child's needs, which is right and proper. Does she have a timeline for when that will be complete?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We can touch on that when we meet again.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	A constituency colleague, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, raised disability services too. We are fortunate that we have services in CHO 6, with St. John of God, St. Michael's House and a number of other service providers. That is excellent but there are delays in simple resources and facilities. One involves a child who has been waiting for over six months for a wheelchair. It is not anything bespoke. It is a standard wheelchair. There has to be a better turnaround time. I assume there was a good tendering process, with these being brought in and delivered to families who need them. Is there a reason for such an inordinate delay for something as simple as a wheelchair?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	From the perspective of a family of children or adults with disabilities, there is no clear pathway. It seems to be a maze for those families. We need to clear a pathway. There should be a helpline to ring and information about the services and entitlements that people will be afforded. If something niche or bespoke is required, people understand that there will be a delay. I cannot understand such a delay for such a basic necessity as a wheelchair. The answers I have got about why there is a delay have not been clear. I will liaise further with Ms O'Connor about that. To me, it points to a bigger problem. We have an issue with residential care and respite places in CHO 6, which I understand happens nationwide. How are we progressing with purchasing and staffing properties for residential places? I understand the issue with staffing extends across the country. Mr. Reid said that resources are not an issue for staffing and recruitment, but getting people into those positions is the challenge. How are we faring with residential and respite care?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms O'Connor might send a note about that. As she said, respite and residential care are not aired enough. I would appreciate an update on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am chair of the all-party Oireachtas committee on diabetes. I am aware of a framework being discussed by the HSE and providers of certain continuous glucose monitors, CGM. It is taking a long time. There was a previous attempt in 2017 and 2018 to get approval for a particular monitor.That has an impact on those with diabetes. I do not expect Ms O'Connor to have the information right now but if she could come back to me on that, we need to have a definitive timeframe, given the fact that it is at least four years in discussions with the HSE, and also on the LTI list. The supports and adaptations for the CGM monitors also need to be included on the LTI list.  As I am conscious of time I will turn to the value for money aspect for nursing homes. In the documentation it states the cost of providing service in a public nursing home was two-and-a-half times the cost in a public nursing home. What is the update now that report has been published? What will we see in changes of the funding model? What is the thinking within the HSE on the Value for Money report?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is by the end of the year.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have one minute remaining for three questions. In regard to the waiting lists and the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, in April a total of 7,221 patients were on some form of public waiting list to be treated or assessed by a consultant. How is the NTPF assisting in those figures or is it not assisting with those numbers? Also, the last time the HSE was in, we spoke about the cyberattack. It is obviously of huge interest to everybody that we would be well prepared and resourced to head off any other such incident. However, the recruitment of the head of the national cybersecurity centre, NCSC, was outstanding at the time. I understand that the salary had to be changed and another offer made. Where does that stand now?  Finally I notice in Vote 38(F)(1) on page 9 of the appropriation accounts for 2020 there was a reduction in expenditure in regard to the payments for those affected by thalidomide. Why was there a reduction in that? Hopefully that issue and the cause for those thalidomide sufferers is coming to a resolution after, not years, but many decades.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Watt.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Reid's-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was just on the issue of cybersecurity from the Department's perspective, that is all. I hear what Mr. Reid is saying about the HSE internal situation which is welcome. Does Mr. Watt have any further update in terms of the NCSC?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses.
