CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Tánaiste will be aware from his time as Minister for Health of the challenges faced by children with spina bifida and their families in their daily lives. One such family, Tanya and Colin Boyce from Dún Laoghaire, recently shared the story of their four and a half-year-old daughter, Cara, and the impact the waiting lists and delays are having on her health. Children and adults with spina bifida and hydrocephalus need to be prioritised. I am aware of the recent multi-annual funding of €4 million from the Government, along with an additional €1 million to Children's Health Ireland. However, the medics and parents are unsure about the allocation to spina bifida specifically. I ask the Tánaiste to raise the matter with the Minister for Health and to engage with Professor Connor Green from Cappagh Hospital, who has a plan to clear 80% of the waiting lists. I ask the Tánaiste to raise that matter directly.
