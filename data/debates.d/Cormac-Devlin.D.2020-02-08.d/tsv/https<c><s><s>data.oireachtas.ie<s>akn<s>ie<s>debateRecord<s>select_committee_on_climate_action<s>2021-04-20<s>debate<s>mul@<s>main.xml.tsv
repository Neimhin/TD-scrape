CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, it does. I apologise to the Chairman for the delay, as I was attending another meeting. I thank the Minister for his time and it is good to talk to him again. My apologies if some of these questions have already been answered but I understand from Deputy O'Sullivan that perhaps the Minister has touched on this before. If he will excuse me I will ask the question in any event as I did not hear the answer. On the district heating and community energy type schemes, I was with a local group in my own constituency about three weeks ago and it was looking at renewable electricity support schemes. Those who have already taken the plunge and retrofitted their homes are looking to put power back into the grid. Where are we at with this possibility at present? How far off are we with that particular initiative?  The Minister spoke of when we get to certain point that there will be many people looking to retrofit their homes and rightly so. We are near enough to that point already and the skills are not there to deal with the demand. Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the SEAI and I too have constituents who have been waiting for an enormous amount of time to be able to draw down the fund, let alone get the work done, and this is another hurdle for them. On the SEAI and its staffing levels, additional funding has been given to it to manage this programme. Can the Minister elaborate on the SEAI's progress in respect of its recruitment? On the practical side of getting all this rolled out, which is really important, how much co-operation is there between the Minister's own Department and, for example, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage? We spoke about local authority housing. In my own constituency in the county council of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, the authority has done an enormous amount of work. All of the buildings are highly rated for energy efficiency. Some of the newer developments actually meet the standards for passive housing. Some of the housing is really old stock. The Minister is right about the cost-benefit analysis. It is really difficult to do one house because, for example, some in a terrace may have been purchased. We are really down to the bottom of the barrel, the expensive part, in trying to get as many of those houses as possible done. What co-operation or links exist between the Minister's Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, with regard to apprenticeships? Will the Minister touch on those points?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	With regard to the community energy schemes, those who have already done it now have excess power they want to sell back to the grid. Where are we in that regard? In terms of supporting communities that want to come together and support each other through energy sharing and so on, where are we with that at the present time?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Following on from Deputy Whitmore on river quality, I note the Minister has allocated €33.3 million in programme D, which is very welcome. Will the Minister outline the Department's involvement and the co-operation it has with Irish Water, the EPA, many local authorities and Waterways Ireland, for example? One of the big issues in urban areas relates to misconnections into the local rivers and there is also the grey run-off water matter from roads and so on because some of the older roads and gulleys still empty into local rivers. While river water quality has improved over the years, there remains a serious risk to biodiversity in and around the rivers. Will the Minister comment on future programmes of his Department designed to tackle grey run-off water waste from roads, factories and so on, and those misconnections? What is in the pipeline - excuse the pun - for the Department working with all the agencies I mentioned?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely. I share the Minister's concern about Dublin Bay. He is correct that a capital programme by Irish Water is under way. I am wondering about the funding from the Minister's Department, particularly for the EPA, Waterways Ireland and so on. He might revert to me after the meeting to emphasise the issue. Local authorities do fantastic work monitoring river water quality but it is important that at every turn we try to prevent those misconnections and that grey water running into the rivers. That will also prevent from happening what the Minister described happening in Dublin Bay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On programme E, I welcome the €50 million allocated for the EPA. This touches on the issue we discussed under programme D. Remediation of landfill sites is an issue, particularly in urban areas. The €26 million provided for this is very welcome. I will focus on the sum of €10.2 million for waste management initiatives that seek to increase awareness of the necessity to minimise waste and increase recycling. What is the Government doing to reduce packaging? It is key that we reduce packaging before we talk about recycling. Excess waste through packaging must be tackled. Will some of the €10.2 million go towards initiatives in that area? If not, what funding will be provided for this purpose? Is the Government talking to manufacturers here and abroad to reduce packaging? The public do not want so much packaging when their packages arrive because they must pay the cost of disposal. We would do ourselves a favour if we tackled the issue of packaging before products reach supermarket shelves.
