CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for attending. I understand that €4.5 billion is already secured and realised through the organisation. Credit is due to the work on that. There is a projection that €4 billion is to be realised between 2019 and the end of the organisation's role, as it were. Is that still on track?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Comptroller and Auditor General's report says there was a large number of high-risk, equity-backed loans, which had no property or collateral. This relates to Project Nantes, which NAMA acquired from participating banks for a nominal amount of €1 per loan. Most other loans were property-backed and related to properties in the US and across Europe. With regard to that portfolio, I understand Project Nantes was one of the first portfolios the witness dealt with under NAMA. From his earlier comments and the question regarding an individual who was involved both on the negotiating side and ultimately in one of the purchasing entities, I believe he said that the amount was mooted around October 2011 but he did not start until, perhaps, November or the like.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. According to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the negotiations were continuing. It states that it went on to agree adjustments. Basically, it was not finalised and was continuing. How long did that process continue?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Did the price change from that originally mooted in October through to December?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Obviously, the concern of the committee is not only the connection with that individual, which I heard the witness say he regrets, and it would have been better if it had been made known in advance of all this, but also the losses that materialised at the end of the day. We want to see the full value realised on behalf of the taxpayer. I have a question for the Comptroller and Auditor General. His report states that "without the assurance of a contemporaneous asset valuation and a competitive sales process, there is no basis to conclude that NAMA achieved the best possible financial outturn from the Project Nantes loan sale". What was missing in his investigations that means he cannot make a full definitive evaluation in terms of any impropriety, if one can call it that? His report also states that since Project Nantes involved a loan sale, "there is no reason to believe that there was any infringement of section 172 of the NAMA Act". How did he come to that conclusion?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Which is it - a competitive process or if there was more information available to him?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have two quick questions. In terms of the lands and sites NAMA currently has to dispose of before 2025 or thereabouts and previous land it has sold, has NAMA kept the full planning permissions attached to those sites active or did it let them lapse? If so, roughly how many are we talking about? I would have hoped and expected that extensions to planning permissions would have been applied for to keep the value on the sites. Finally, if we find there are breaches of section 172, will enforcement action and pursuit of those issues be taken?
