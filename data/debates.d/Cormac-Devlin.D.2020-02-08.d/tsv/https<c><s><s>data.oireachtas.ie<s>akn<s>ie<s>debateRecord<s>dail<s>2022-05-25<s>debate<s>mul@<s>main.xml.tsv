CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have been contacted by many constituents who are very concerned about the situation at Dublin Airport. There have been regular reports of delays for passengers going through security screening, which have sometimes resulted in them missing their flights. Over the weekend, there were worrying reports about the airport failing the European Aviation Safety Agency audit and last night, we saw reports on social media of a brawl in the departure lounge. I know staff on the ground are doing their best in difficult circumstances but we were promised by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, that 300 new staff would be employed by the end of June. Will the Minister request an update from the DAA? Will he engage with it about the management of the airport?
