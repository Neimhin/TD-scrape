CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Apologies have been received from the Cathaoirleach of the committee, Deputy Brian Leddin, and Deputy Alan Farrell. The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 29. I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex. In this regard, I ask all members to confirm prior to making their contributions that they are on the grounds of Leinster House. In accordance with Standing Orders, discussion should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimate. I call on the Minister of State to make his opening statement, which will be followed by questions and answers.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State and open the floor to any members who may have questions on the Supplementary Estimate.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I call Deputy Bríd Smith.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank Deputy Bríd Smith. As I was giving Deputy Leddin’s apologies earlier, he walked through the door. He is welcome.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	While some of my questions have already been asked, I will seek clarity on certain aspects. On the €90 million savings, in response to a few questions, the Minister of State outlined the forecast of €23 million in savings from the one-stop shop and the community energy schemes. I also heard his comments about the target perhaps not being met this year due to supply chain issues but that it will be caught up with in 2023, which is understandable. In terms of the retrofitting schemes, we heard about solar panels going into homes for those who have medical needs and, obviously, a higher energy requirement, as well as for those on lower incomes. Does the Minister of State have any specifics or data from his officials -I realise that this is not his portfolio - about the number of houses in respect of which progress has been made with solar panels, even down to attic insulation and draught excluders, and anything to try to improve the energy efficiency of homes in the calendar year 2022? Does the Minister of State have data on that?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	From our perspective, it is frustrating that we are trying to discuss the Supplementary Estimate and yet we do not have the information we require. It is not the Minister of State's fault-----
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I know. I refer to the better energy warmer homes scheme specifically for the elderly. I and every other member of this committee have constituents who have applied for these initiatives, which are very welcome, but there is a backlog in that specific scheme. I am sure if that is the Minister of State's experience too. Does the saving that we are talking about, the supply chain issues, relate to that scheme as well? Is it all the schemes operated by the one stop shop in the SEAI or is it a particular scheme?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	It has. Unfortunately, even after the briefings we still do not get a result. After the announcement of the improved grants, which was very welcome, the public responded with gusto because they wanted to avail of them, only to find that there was no capacity in either the one-stop shop or the subsequent suppliers. There are other issues curtailing the roll-out of those schemes so we hope to see an improvement on that in late 2022 and early 2023. To return to the solar panels, this is something I raised with the Minister last week in the Dáil,. I hope the officials will refer it back to the Department. There is an expectation on the part of people, particularly those who are hard-pressed in advance of winter, to avail of improvements to their homes. We need to prioritise that. I will turn to the electricity grant. The Minister of State highlighted the grant in the context of subhead 11. He indicated that the remaining unallocated funding by the suppliers must be returned by ESBN to the Department by the end of July. Was the amount €20 million?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	It that because there was an overestimation in respect of the grant? People could not avoid availing of it. It was there in their accounts. I know that some could gift it back. Where did that €20 million come from?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	To go back to the point about the sub-meters, there was a fair point made about halting sites and other multi-unit developments. Some people did not actually get the credit for one reason or another. Perhaps they had moved house or they live in these multi-unit developments or dwellings. What is the process for them? Do the officials have any advice for how they avail of that credit? Some of them have not received it yet.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	There is a lot of information to come back to the committee following its examination of the Supplementary Estimate. Obviously, more detail on the 450 MW of additional generation capacity would be very helpful. There are no further questions from Deputies for the Minister of State. I thank him and the officials for their engagement.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	In accordance with Standing Order 101 the following message will be sent to the Dáil:The Select Committee on Environment and Climate Action has completed its consideration of the Supplementary Estimates for public services for the year ending 31 December 2022: Vote 29 - Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.
