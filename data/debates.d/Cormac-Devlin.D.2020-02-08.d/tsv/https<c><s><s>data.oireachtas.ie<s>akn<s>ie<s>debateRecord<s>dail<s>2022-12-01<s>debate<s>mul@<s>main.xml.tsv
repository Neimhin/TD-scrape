CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	The next session will be questions to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. While we await his arrival, I welcome our guests to the Visitors Gallery. Good morning to everybody. You are all very welcome. There were other visitors during the debate earlier, too. It is great to have so many visitors to the House today. It is an historic day, with the President of the European Commission coming to address the House, which is why the rostrum is here beside me.
