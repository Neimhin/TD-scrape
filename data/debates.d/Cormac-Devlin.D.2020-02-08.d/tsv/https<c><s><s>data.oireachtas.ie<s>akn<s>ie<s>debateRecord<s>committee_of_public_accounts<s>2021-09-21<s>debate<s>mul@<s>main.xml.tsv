CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Similar to Deputy Catherine Murphy, some of the queries I had have been answered. In terms of No. 13, the residential institutions statutory fund board, Caranua, we have had its representatives before the committee previously. I am not sure if it has been dissolved in the interim, but the Comptroller and Auditor General might be able to tell us a little more. I note he says there were inadequate controls over grant payments. We discussed that with the representatives previously, but the Comptroller and Auditor General might refer back to me. Also, there is Tusla and the significant non-compliant procurement. That is something we must flag, and likewise with the NTA and the ICT project. With regard to the Residential Tenancies Board and the management system for the tenancy registration, that is something we deal with regularly with constituents. The sum of â‚¬5.2 million is a significant amount. The Comptroller and Auditor General might be able to refer back to us on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There was the point about Tusla and the significant non-compliance and also the Residential Tenancies Board.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree with previous speakers about this. Like others, I was on the site and viewed the construction. It was my second time there in a period of eight to ten months so I have seen the development of the site and the progress made. What struck me from our visit was when those present spoke about changes being made and accounted for. Certain design changes had to be made and that accounted for costs and changes to plans. Ultimately, from our perspective as a committee, we must know the bottom line of how much the State will pay for this hospital. This has been rumbling on for years and certainly from that correspondence there does not seem to be any bottom line here. It is incumbent on us as a committee to probe that and try to get to the final cost or at least near enough to it. The public wants to know and it has a right to that. I agree with previous speakers that we should invite in representatives of both the Department and the board to discuss that element as it is progressing and what we have seen in recent months. It is still a long way off completion and we must have some sort of crystallisation of cost.
