CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses. I will start with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and specifically the part dealing with concerns around tendering. I understand that it is the second year running that this issue has been highlighted. I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on the depth and breadth of this issue. How extensive has the lack of tendering been and what kinds of contracts are we talking about? I ask Mr. Griffin to outline the remedies put in place by the Department last year to correct this.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Obviously, this is a recurring issue. I hear what Mr. Griffin is saying, that the vast bulk of this relates to the NBP in 2019. What was the issue in 2018 and how is it going to be corrected going into 2021?

CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the environmental fund, the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to €37 million in his report. Will Mr. Griffin elaborate on what that money is used for? Will he also elaborate on the €15 million broadcast fund? What was the €27 million surplus for 2020 ultimately used for? If he does not have the time to reply or the information to hand, he can send it on to me.
