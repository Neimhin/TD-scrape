CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome all of the witnesses and thank them for their attendance and for their ongoing co-operation with the various Oireachtas committees, which is greatly appreciated. I also thank all of the staff of the HSE and the Department of Health for their efforts in the fight against Covid-19. I wish to take up some of the points made earlier on costs. The breakdown of the 550 nursing homes involved is that 80% are private and 20% are public. Of the millions of euro that are spent, is there a disparity between the care and ancillary costs for people in public nursing homes as opposed to private homes? I refer to care, equipment and activities. Are those costs covered if a person is in a public nursing home as opposed to a private one? My understanding is that all of the ancillary costs in private nursing homes are paid for by residents or their families.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is Ms O'Connor saying that the value for money group is going to examine that issue, along with other issues in terms of the disbursement of the NTPF money? I invite Dr. O'Reardon to come in on this as well. Nursing Homes Ireland has called for an independent appeals mechanism to be introduced within the fair deal negotiation process. Is that going to be considered by the value for money group?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Did Dr. O'Reardon say that the review has been completed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In regard to the expenditure of €969 million, Dr. O'Reardon indicated that, with 24,000 residents this year, that figure would hit more than €1 billion. I acknowledge the comments by the HSE witnesses regarding the 80:20 split as between public versus private provision. In terms of agency staff costs for the HSE, there seems to be an inequality - if one wants to call it that; disparity might be a better word - between public and private nursing homes. I hope that will be addressed within the work of the value for money group or in any of the other reports that are being done. There is a perceived inequality in this area and that needs to be addressed. Certainly, in terms of the staffing costs detailed in the report of the audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the sheer volume of agency staff being used needs to be addressed because it is going to drag up those costs. Ultimately, the public is paying for it.
