CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Government has made several welcome efforts to cushion families from the increase in energy prices caused by Russia's war on Ukraine and Putin's attempt to use gas and oil as strategic weapons against the west. In April, the Minister committed to introducing a scheme to offer solar panels to people with high energy usage due to a medical need or to elderly people at risk of energy poverty. As he is aware, I raised this issue with him last month by way of a parliamentary question. It was confirmed at that stage that the issue was with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and stakeholders for review. I ask the Minister to provide an update as winter is rapidly approaching. Many of these families have contacted me. Many of them want to make arrangements for the months ahead. When will the scheme go live?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome this legislation, which updates the substitute-consent regime provided in the Planning and Development Act 2000. The Bill's purpose is essentially to streamline the substitute-consent procedure in the planning system. Streamlining of the substitute-consent regime is required to increase the efficiency and utility of the process in order to safeguard confidence in the Irish planning system by eliminating a surplus step in the substitute-consent process. It will also ensure that the system is fully in compliance with EU environmental requirements and recent court judgments. In this context, it is proposed to provide for a single-stage application process under the remit of An Bord Pleanála, which would replace the current two-stage process. It is also proposed to amend section 37L of the planning Act, which currently allows simultaneous applications to be made for certain quarry developments for both future development and substitute consent to An Bord Pleanála at the same time, so that simultaneous applications will be open to all types of development. Amendments are also proposed to section 34(12) of the Act which will require planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to screen an application for retention permission for EIA and AA, and refuse to consider applications for retention of unauthorised development where either EIA or AA are screened in. While we are considering this legislation, it is appropriate to mention the current situation at An Bord Pleanála. Recent revelations have resulted in a loss of public confidence in the organisation. I know the Minister has ordered an inquiry, which is currently under way. Of course we await its publication, but it is clear the issue of public confidence in the board must be addressed. It is critical that the public and stakeholders can have confidence and faith in our planning system. Ireland's international reputation is at stake. I look forward to measures being taken quickly to restore confidence when the inquiry concludes. As regards, this largely technical Bill, I thank the Minister and his officials for introducing the legislation. I hope it will streamline the process and deliver a more efficient planning system.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Tánaiste for introducing this legislation, which provides legal protection for workers in respect of tips and gratuities. It will mean any tips received cannot be counted towards an employee's basic pay; they must be counted as additional and separate. The treatment of tips and gratuities has been a long-standing issue that is regularly raised by employees and trade unions. Historically, all good employers left it to workers to make their own arrangements around tips. However, with the advent of card payments, particularly contactless payments during the Covid-19 pandemic, employers and management became involved in processing these payments. In some cases, the distribution of electronic tips was facilitated but in many establishments, tips paid by card could not be processed. There are also reports of tips and gratuities being included as part of basic wages by some unscrupulous employers, as referred to earlier. The aim of this Bill is to provide clarity on the meaning of tips, gratuities and service charges, to place tips and gratuities, but not service charges, outside the scope of a person's contractual wages, to oblige employers to display prominently their policy on the distribution of both cash and card payments and to oblige employers to distribute fairly, equitably and in a transparent manner tips that are received in an electronic form, that is, through debit or credit card payments or by way of smartphones. This will provide a legal basis and certainty for employees in respect of tips. It will also provide certainty to the public. When paying for a meal, especially when paying by card or smartphone, many people are unaware of how, or whether, tips and service charges are distributed among staff. Once this law is enacted, all employers will be required to show clearly how tips and service charges are dealt with in their businesses. This will provide clarity for both customers and staff. Most establishments already treat their employees fairly with regard to tips. For them, these provisions will mean no change beyond having to display their policy clearly, which is extremely welcome. People working in hospitality and other service sectors have made tremendous efforts during the pandemic to keep services going. In many cases, they did so at some risk to themselves and, indeed, their families. This Bill will provide legal protections in respect of tips and gratuities and it is very welcome. I thank the Tánaiste and his officials for introducing it.
