CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I was listening to a portion of the meeting online between various other commitments this morning. I wish Mr. Hogan and his colleagues a good afternoon. It is good to have them before us again. I will start with the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statements. He said the national debt is €237 billion. That is up on the end of 2020 by €17.7 billion. He also said that it was 20% lower than that of 2020 on foot of the NTMA's ability to avail of the low interest rates over recent years. How does Mr. Hogan see the various interest rates, the challenges from inflation and everything else happening over the next number of months and potentially years - although hopefully not - impacting on our national debt going forward?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand. Mr. Hogan has a lot of notes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted that Ireland's contribution to the EU budget last year was €3.5 billion. That was 36% higher than in 2020. I know Mr. Hogan has a lot of notes, and I apologise if I am going over old ground but I heard only some, not all, of the contributions. The Department might forward a note to the committee on our contribution to the EU budget and give a year-on-year breakdown of how much we have contributed. What is the expectation for Ireland’s contribution in the coming years? Would it be to the same extent as this 36% increase? Would that be the average growth per year? How is that calculated?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Did they relate to the pandemic?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Gradually-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would that demonstrate-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Dr. Whitaker and others-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the Lemass era in that regard. I mentioned the escrow account when Mr. Hogan was previously before the committee. Forgive me if he has already done so, but I ask Mr. Hogan to provide an update to the committee on its performance. I note from the information Mr. Hogan provided that there was a reduction in that. That was because of a third country. I ask Mr. Hogan to provide an update on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is an ongoing challenge to it. Do we have any time frame on that? I was under the impression that we might be nearing the end of that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that. Is the Department estimating that it has another year to run or could it be many years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is to be anticipated.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have one minute left and if I may-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Very good.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I was going to say it did not involve six numbers, eight numbers or whatever is needed. If it was the Chair would not be sitting here at all. Does the Chair want me to take over?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the corporation tax. The witnesses may have dealt with this already when I was not here. When is that new 15% rate anticipated to take effect?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that January of 2024?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is it. I thank the witnesses.
