CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome all the organisations who have appeared before the committee today and for the statements they have made. I would also particularly like to praise the staff of the respective organisations, indeed, the players and the many volunteers up and down the country who have kept things going. Even when there was not much happening, they were still willing to serve and put plans in place. Much has been said about the €70 million that was given in funding, and that consisted of €40 million for each of the three organisations, and some from other sporting bodies, such as local sports partnerships and clubs. All of the witnesses have referred to Sport Ireland's expert medical group. How often does it meet? Are all the organisations participating at the same meeting and is it a group meeting, as it were? I would like an answer to that question first, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Ryan for his answer.  First, I would like to offer my congratulations to the many volunteers in the GAA. I understand from Mr. Horan's opening statement that the organisation is processing approximately 91,000 health questionnaires daily, and various activities have been kept going over the last number of months. As Deputy Andrews stated, in respect of mental health, all sports, irrespective of their code, play an important role in people's lives. I acknowledge there were significant financial issues prior to Covid for the FAI, and obviously the pandemic is compounding the problem. I understand that it has applied for €19.3 million in funding. I want to ask specifically about the League of Ireland, and the impact of the pandemic there. In his opening remarks, Mr. Owens mentioned the pressures on individual clubs. My question to the FAI is this: are there plans to reduce the registration fees or other costs associated with participating in the League of Ireland for individual clubs? What measures have been put in place to try and ease the burden for the clubs that might not have the same resources as others?  In his opening remarks, Mr. Browne stated that he predicted there would be a €30 million loss for the IRFU this year. Am I correct in saying that there could be another potential €30 million loss for ticket revenue for 2020, plus further €5 million per month going forward?  I appreciate that the organisations have mentioned the importance of spectators, and the importance of spectating for the fans, irrespective of the code. Notwithstanding what happens today in Dublin, how do the witnesses see their engagement with Sport Ireland and the ability to get some spectator sport back on television, or spectators physically in the stadia or on the pitches, over the next couple of months and indeed next year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I now invite Mr. Owens to respond to my questions.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No, the League of Ireland was the main thing really, because of its importance. I now invite Mr. Browne to answer the same questions.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank all our witnesses for joining us this afternoon. I am sure they are familiar with the earlier contributions from the three large sporting organisations, namely, the IRFU, the GAA and the FAI.Some of my questions will be based on the information garnered from them. Mr. Kelly mentioned the LSPs, the very important role they play and the €7 million that was allocated to them this year. I refer to the issue of mental health and general well-being, particularly in light of the pandemic and the issues people have faced with the restrictions. In my constituency of Dún Laoghaire, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has come up with pretty creative and imaginative ways of hosting events that are set pieces in the calendar. An example of that is the community walk, which is now going to be done over a week, and people will do that in their own smaller local parks where possible. There are also cycling and other initiatives to keep people active, which is very welcome. The funding the Department supplies is critical to these partnerships and other organisations, including sporting ones, which Mr. Treacy touched on with reference to charity events. All of these things are being done in a different way due to the circumstances that faces us. In his opening statement, Mr. Kelly referenced the sports capital programme and €19 million having been paid out so far this year. A full review of that programme in 2018 is being conducted and it is due to report shortly. When is that going to be published? Equally, the sports capital programme is going to reopen later this year. Does Mr. Kelly have a timeframe for that? As he will appreciate, many sports clubs, which may be watching this afternoon, will be very keen to know when that round of funding is opening. I read in Mr. Kelly's opening statement that due diligence and appraisals are under way as well on the LSSIF. Given the financial pressures Covid has put on clubs and organisations that may have applied for that fund, what happens if that money is not drawn down? I ask because he said that there are no plans in the short term to reopen that fund.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Sheahan. That will be reassuring for those clubs and organisations that have been granted funding but whose circumstances have also changed. In the time remaining, I might ask Mr. Treacy a question focusing on elite athletes. He mentioned Tokyo. There are other events coming down the track for many sports as well. What supports have been put in place since the initial Covid outbreak in Ireland for elite athletes? Some might not have the necessary training capabilities in their immediate environs. When the travel restrictions and so forth were lifted, what supports were put in place vis-à-vis travel and accommodation for people who had critical deadlines in their professional careers?
