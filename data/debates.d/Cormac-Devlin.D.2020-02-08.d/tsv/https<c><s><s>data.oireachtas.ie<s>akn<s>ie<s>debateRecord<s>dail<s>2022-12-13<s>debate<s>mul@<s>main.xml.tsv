CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This is one of the last Taoiseach's questions in this Dáil term. We are now 12 sleeps away from Christmas. Many children, having written their letters to Santa, are anxiously awaiting the arrival of Santa Claus. I know Santa, Mrs. Claus and all the elves are very busy making all of the presents and the arrangements for them to be delivered across the world. Can the Taoiseach confirm that arrangements are in place for Santa and reindeer to enter Irish airspace on Christmas Eve? It is a tough question for the Taoiseach on his last day taking Taoiseach's questions.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Budget 2023 delivered significant emergency support to cushion households from the worst affects of the energy crisis. One key welcome change was the expansion of eligibility limits for the fuel allowance payment for people over 70 years. The income threshold for those over 70 years has been increased to €1,000 a week. That is a significant and very welcome improvement to the scheme. I thank the Taoiseach and the Minister for making this important change. Will the Taoiseach commit to asking the Minister to arrange for a publicity campaign to let people know about the positive change coming into affect in January?
