CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our witnesses and thank them for their attendance. I have another committee meeting after this one so I apologise for having to leave after my questioning. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is broad and so are my questions. I look forward to engaging with each and every witness. I will start with programme A. Mr. Gleeson mentioned animal welfare. I noticed that the current spend on this is €3 million less than was spent in 2019. On the capital side, only half was spent compared with what was estimated to be spent in 2019. Could Mr. Gleeson elaborate on that and why that came to pass? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. My question concerns the World Food Programme. Mr. Gleeson mentioned that it was an advance on 2020. I understand this and it is welcome and proper. Given the scale of challenge for that UN programme, particularly after Covid-19, could Mr. Gleeson elaborate as to how he sees the 2021 programme developing? Obviously, there was, as he noted, a request from the executive director in 2019 for an advance but how might that impact on 2021 and ensuing years? I know it is a three-year agreement so I am wondering when it is due to be renewed. Mr. Gleeson might elaborate on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If I can help Mr. Gleeson, I will ask it in a different format. Could he outline the role and importance of Department inspections in the horse racing and greyhound industries? He might have a figure. If he does not have one today, he might come back to me.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Gleeson. I presume it is quite similar moving to the meat processing plants. I was a member of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response and the meat processing plants played a central role through our investigations into the spread of Covid-19 throughout 2020. Mr. Gleeson might elaborate on that. I know the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, and the HSE are the agents carrying out the inspections but my understanding is that Mr. Gleeson's Department has ultimate responsibility in respect of the inspections. Will he outline to the committee the number of inspections done in 2020 and the number done so far in 2021?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would ditch those headphones if I were Mr. Gleeson because we can hear him clearly now, much better than we did with them on.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Gleeson can come back to me on the number of inspections last year but I think the public would want reassurance that the inspections are ongoing. Is that the case?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand that. I thank Mr. Gleeson for that. I have limited time, so apologies. It is reassuring to know that they are ongoing. It was not just Covid-19 that impacted on last year and 2019; it was Brexit also. I come from a coastal constituency in Dún Laoghaire and we are very proud to have BIM located in the town. I note that the seafood industry in 2020 accounted for a little over €1 billion but I understand that was down 18% on 2019. The funding of that service, of BIM, is essential. Will Mr. Gleeson outline the role and operation of the Department in dealing with both Brexit and Covid-19 over the past two years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Gleeson for that. I will turn to the Comptroller and Auditor General report, particularly in respect of the procurement issues. There were some non-compliance issues. I believe there were 98 contracts in total with a value of a little over €14 million. In the same vein, I note also that there was the risk and control framework. That predates my time but I understand that in 2017, there was some sort of internal audit committee that, to my surprise, was wound down in the Department. I am happy to see, however, that a new risk management system has been put in place and there is an estimated timeframe. Is it the asset verification register that is due to be complete by 2021? Are we still on track for that to be completed this year? Also, Mr. Gleeson might comment on how his Department is dealing with the non-compliance issues as outlined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, the asset verification project was expected to be done by 2021. Are we still on track with that? The Department would want to make sure that the project is completed by the time Mr. Gleeson appears before us next year.
