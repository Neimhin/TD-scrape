CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank all the witnesses for attending the meeting and for their opening statements. I will stick with the last item, the district heating system. The witnesses mentioned that the Department has started a working group. I am not sure when that began, but they are hoping to report by the end of the year. It seems quite late to me to have begun such a process. Can the witnesses give a bit more information on the scope of that working group? I know they said the SEAI is working closely with them.I am familiar with the report commissioned by Dublin City Council in August 2020 that looked to Poolbeg. Is Poolbeg constructed to facilitate and contribute to a district heating system in that area at this juncture? Will it also have to be retrofitted to supply the region with a district heating system?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms McCarthy. Is the SEAI aware of whether Poolbeg, as it is constructed, can contribute to such a system?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	They can be joined at a time in the near future, it is hoped.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that and I thank Ms McCarthy. The committee might follow up on the district heating system and the working group. I am sure we will discuss it again. I want to turn to the issue of deep retrofits. On the previous occasion the SEAI was before the committee, the target was 500,000 homes with 75,000 homes per annum. If I heard correctly, 25,000 homes have been done so far this year. Is this correct?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	With regard to the one-stop shops, when we initially spoke, three suppliers had been earmarked, which was putting enormous pressure on the system. There are now 12 and ten are about to join. Even so, 22 is not sufficient to cover the country. What other methods are being deployed to try to encourage people to come into the one-stop shops? As I have asked previously, what are the biggest obstacles to getting suppliers into the one-stop shops?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The 80% grant was met with much fanfare and significant interest was expressed in it. What impact is inflation having on the 80% grant, specifically in respect of attic and cavity wall insulation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Randles or one of the other witnesses may be able to answer this-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman and appreciate him letting me come back in. Apologies, I had to attend another meeting. Earlier I heard the figures relating to the warmer homes scheme. They stated that 3,200 homes had been delivered so far this year, 1,300 contractors were involved with 328 to join and there were 11,300 applications with 420 in progress. If my figures are incorrect, I ask for them to be corrected. There is a waiting time of 28 months with ten months for the survey delivery. Is there scope to improve those timeframes, particularly that ten-month delay? We are talking about people who are in dire need. Many of those houses have a low energy rating to begin with but they households also are on low income. How can that process be sped up? My second question relates to the retrofitting. I have had a few queries where people are concerned that the basic retrofitting was not done to the correct standard a number of years ago. Does it automatically preclude them from the 80% grant if their house is not up to a certain specification? If the witnesses could answer those two questions, I would appreciate it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Dr. Byrne for his reply. If, for instance, a good few years ago - Dr. Byrne is correct in that this was under a certain scheme - somebody applied for attic insulation which did not bring the property up to a specific standard, due to fact they applied for it under the previous scheme, irrespective of how good or beneficial it was, is it correct to say that they cannot re-apply under the 80%?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, I thank our SEAI guest speakers.
