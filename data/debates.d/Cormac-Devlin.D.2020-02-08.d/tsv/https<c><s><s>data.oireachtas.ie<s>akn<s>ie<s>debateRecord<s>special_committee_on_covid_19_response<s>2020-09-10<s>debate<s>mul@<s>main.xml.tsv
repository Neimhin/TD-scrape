CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank our witnesses for their report and welcome them before the committee. The report contains 86 recommendations, 24 of which are relevant to HIQA. HIQA has meetings with the Department. I presume that is happening on an ongoing basis. How often are those meetings? I will speak in particular about Ms Dunnion's brief. There are 576 registered nursing homes in Ireland, of which 189 were inspected, if I am reading the report correctly, and there were also 2,851 phone inspections. How many inspections of all types of facilities are carried out under HIQA? Has the number of inspections increased or decreased in the light of Covid? In anticipation of a second wave, what would HIQA recommend and do differently, given that it has some time to plan this time around?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Cliffe for that clarification on the phone interventions; I should not have said "inspections". Of the 106 to which she has referred, are they purely of nursing homes or is that in the broader remit of HIQA? Are they inspections of centres or facilities already inspected and follow-ups, as it were?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Were they follow-up inspections of previous inspections?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This is my final question. Have the number of inspections, not just of nursing homes but overall, increased or decreased year-on-year as a result of Covid-19?
