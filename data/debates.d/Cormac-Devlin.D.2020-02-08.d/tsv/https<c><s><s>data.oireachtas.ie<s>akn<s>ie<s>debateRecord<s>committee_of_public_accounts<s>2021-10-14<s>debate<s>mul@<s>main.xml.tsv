CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I bid Mr. Griffin and his colleagues a good morning and thank them very much for their attendance. I will take up the point made by my colleague, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, on blackspots across the city and county of Dublin and the greater Dublin area. We need reassurance that the NBP is going to address those blackspots. Many consumers have contacted all Deputies, in particular in urban areas. They are being told by providers that their broadband connection is coming and if they sign up, they will be connected in 12 months but that is not happening. Whether it is a breakdown or an over-promise by certain providers, are these issues going to be addressed in the short term? It was stated that 257,000 premises had been surveyed. The Comptroller and Auditor General thinks there should be a separate subhead for this extensive plan and Mr. Griffin might come back on that as well to say if that is going to be incorporated into this year's accounts. We need reassurance that Dublin is going to be addressed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know it is extensive. It would be good if Mr. Mulligan could organise a deputation for Dublin Deputies on those issues, but that can be for another day. I will turn to the NCSC and staffing. A total of 20 new posts were announced in July, following the cyberattack on the HSE in March. That would bring the total number of staff from 25 to 45. What progress has been made on their recruitment and on the appointment of a director for the centre?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On that point, when did the contract go back out for the director?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Griffin. On the timeframe, am I correct that the post was advertised in mid-September or thereabouts?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The only change was around salary and conditions. Is that not too long a timeframe given the sensitivity and urgency of this position? I accept that is the role of the Public Appointments Service and not Mr. Griffin. Given the national and international emphasis following the cyberattack on our health system and, potentially, as mentioned by Mr. Griffin, 3,000 attacks last year and, potentially, an increase on that this year, I would have thought the process of filling a position of that importance, as well as the recruitment of the other staff to bulk up this extremely important centre, would have commenced the day after the position was declined by the other person. Would Mr. Griffin agree?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is correct. That was signed off in July. I am wondering what-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the process, the position was advertised earlier this year, there was a further discussion around the post which ended in mid-July and it took until mid-September to re-advertise effectively the same post. This is not good enough given the sensitivity and scale of the attack on what is arguably our most important Department and potentially others.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that. What is the interaction between the national security analysis centre - I do not want Mr. Griffin to comments on its role - and the National Cyber Security Centre?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Griffin. There are three landfill sites remaining. I commend the Department on its work in light of the European Court of Justice ruling in years past and the cost it brought to the State. In regard to the 494 unregulated sites, what is being done to not only clean them up but to monitor them? Some of them are causing extreme distress to local residents given their unregulated nature. I note the Department spent €6.1 million on the environmental fund to local authorities. How is that being monitored?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Thank you.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman for the second round of questions and I thank Mr. Griffin for his previous responses. I will drill down into a few other elements in the time I have.  Mr. Griffin mentioned the trading online voucher. Some €21 million was spent in 2020 and 13,000 vouchers were awarded. I highlighted that figure because that scheme, and how quickly it was administered by the Department, was appreciated by so many businesses, as I am sure Mr. Griffin will appreciate. In addition, the work of the local enterprise offices in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, the phenomenal roll-out of that programme and how well it was received by businesses, should not go unnoticed here today because it was invaluable to many businesses to get them online. I will return to the landfill issue. We spoke about it previously but did not have enough time. I asked about the €6.1 million allocated to the environmental fund to local authorities to support waste enforcement services anti-dumping initiatives. How is that being monitored by the Department? I can only imagine when the Department divested the landfill issue to each local authority it was probably a little weight off the shoulders but, ultimately, that needs to be monitored to ensure the fund is being utilised correctly and we are seeing value for money on that aspect. How is that being done overall by the Department?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that just today?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Nugent. I understand the national waste collection permit office is run by Offaly County Council. Does that provide permits for the three active sites or is it for all 494 unregistered sites and every other site? He might just elaborate a little on that issue. I presume that also links in with the environmental fund to the local authorities.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I note two elements in the report. The digital skills for citizens scheme had a saving of €2.5 million. That was the amount left unspent by that programme. Given where we are at with the pandemic, I presume that programme will resume shortly. I hope that €2.5 million, along with the new allocation, will be spent quite soon. In the same vein, €6 million was provided from the just transition fund and there was a significant underspend in that regard. There is a note in the report that finalisation of agreements in respect of individual projects faced delay. Has that issue also been resolved, because just transition is going to be more important as the years pass and we get closer to 2030. Will we be able to unblock the system to ensure we can get the money to the various projects that require it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will the €2.5 million that was saved be added to the current budget?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is something we might look into next time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	They are agreed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is all right. Deputy McAuliffe sends his apologies as he has to chair the housing committee. I am also on another committee, so I will be jumping between the two.
