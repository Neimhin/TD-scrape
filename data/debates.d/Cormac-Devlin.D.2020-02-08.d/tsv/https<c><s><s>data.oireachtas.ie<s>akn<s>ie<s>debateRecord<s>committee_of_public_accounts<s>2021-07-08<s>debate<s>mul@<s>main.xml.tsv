CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Ms Maney and Mr. O'Keeffe. I welcome Ms Maney to her role, which is new enough, and commend her on the work she has undertaken in a short period. She took over at a very difficult time and from reading her report and the other information given to us, particularly around case management conferences and hearings that were re-established during the height of the pandemic, it was very important that they were re-established as quickly as possible. I have a number of broad-ranging questions but am limited by time so I would appreciate if the replies could be brief. The witness would be familiar with the alternative dispute resolution system in the UK. The commission runs case management conferences so how similar are they? How frequently are they used? In what kinds of cases are they used? They cannot be used with all appeals but Ms Maney might outline the circumstances in which they are done versus in a hearing, for example. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	A percentage of cases are heard via case management conference. What percentage of the cases dealt with by the commission are progressed in that regard?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Maney might come back to us with that, out of interest. In terms of an appellant making a decision on whether to appeal the assessment from Revenue, 44% of cases were withdrawn by the appellants. If more information was given by Revenue at an earlier stage, would it change the course of an appellant bringing a case? What is the experience with appellants not of Ms Maney but of the commissioners? Is it an issue?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand. I know it is straying into the arena of the Revenue Commissioners.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The committee has dealt with the Revenue Commissioners previously. From our perspective we are trying to understand the interaction between the TAC and Revenue and trying to make a recommendation for improvements. In a bizarre way, although many witnesses do not believe it, the Committee of Public Accounts is here to help. In terms of the supply of information from Revenue to the appellant and the reason for the assessment, in the UK there is a slightly different system with which I am sure Ms Maney is familiar. Would this type of system be more appropriate here? Perhaps it is unfair of me to ask. I am conscious we have a report to compile after this in which we will make recommendations. Is there a need for reform at that early stage?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We might follow up on this with the Department when it comes before us next. An appellant has 30 days from the time of Revenue's assessment. Is this sufficient time? Does the commission find that people are rushed? It could come out of the blue for some. I am speaking about individuals rather than the corporate side.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Equally for the corporate side there might be the same concern. Does Ms Maney think 30 days is sufficient? Is it longer in the UK?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is all right.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I stand to be corrected but I believe in the UK it could be 60 days before a decision has to be taken by a prospective appellant. To turn to the TAC itself, I note there was an underspend because staff could not be taken on. How is the commission getting on with this? Earlier, Ms Maney said there were four commissioners. There was an underspend because of non-recruitment. Is it just commissioners that the TAC is looking to take on? What expertise is it looking to take on?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	First, I want to give apologies from Deputies MacSharry and McAuliffe, please. I must also go to another committee meeting after this. I wish to return to a few items. Out of the legacy cases that have been outstanding for some time, am I correct that 12 are still outstanding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The commission is making progress and, as Ms Maney says, by the end of the year it should be complete.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I was a bit confused by chapter 14 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which said that at the end of 2019 there were 3,357 open appeal cases. It said that in the period of 2016 to 2019, the commission closed over 3,900 appeal cases.How many cases since 2016, when the commission was established, has it dealt with overall? Does Ms Maney have that figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wanted to clarify that. I missed the earlier discussion. I refer to the length of time between an appellant deciding to take a case and the case being heard by the commission. What is the average waiting time for that process?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the internal desire to deal with cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Am I not correct in saying that for appellants there are interests and penalties charged? In theory, they are paying for that delay or the length of time it takes. If the appeal is found in the appellant's favour, it is unfair if he or she has to pay penalties because of a delay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I can appreciate that. The UK system is further down the road than us and has far more experience. I am speaking for individuals and not the corporate world. People who might not have the wherewithal to be able to pay money until a determination has been made are lumbered with further penalties and interest on the sum that Revenue makes. That is a recommendation that the committee will look at. Ms Maney will come back to me on a previous question I asked. She might also inform us how many cases have prepaid and how many have not paid at all and, therefore, would have been subject to penalties. That is of interest to the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We can take that up with Revenue. On the IT system and the 2019 accounts, I note there is an underspend of â‚¬259,000. Ms Maney said a new IT system is coming in. In terms of the data that the commission received from Revenue, are the systems compatible with each other?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good to know. In her opening remarks, Ms Maney mentioned recommendations. I was unsure if she was speaking solely about the recommendations from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that were all being worked through, or whether she was also referring to recommendations from the last time the Tax Appeals Commission appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts in 2018. I understand there were three recommendations from that time. Can Ms Maney confirm to the committee whether all of the recommendations in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the previous committee report will be implemented by the end of the year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Some of them may form the discussions the commission had with the Department of Finance because some were outside of the commission's control but were recommendations from our committee. Ms Maney can come back to me on that. I do not have the recommendations to hand.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Maney.
