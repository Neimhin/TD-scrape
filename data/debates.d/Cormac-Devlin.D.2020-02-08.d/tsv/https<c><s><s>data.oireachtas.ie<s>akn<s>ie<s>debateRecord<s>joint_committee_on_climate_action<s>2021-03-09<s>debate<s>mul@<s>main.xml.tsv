CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I bid the witnesses a good afternoon and thank them for their time. If I could pick up on some of Dr. Caulfield's opening remarks, he referred to equity and just transition. I heard his responses to some of the questions on electric vehicles and also on car sharing. Where is the best balance between the two? The just transition is required but we want people to look at and explore alternative modes of transport, including the targets that we have set for electric vehicles? Where does he think the best spot is in terms of delivering on our targets?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Dr. Caulfield. If I may, I will ask a few questions on BusConnects and other issues. Ms Graham mentioned that there was a review of the transport strategy from 2016. When is that likely to be concluded? Will it be this year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Sticking with that, we have seen a major change in public transport and other modes of transport since the start of the pandemic, will that be taken into consideration in the context of BusConnects which has been extensively discussed this afternoon? Does that change the model in any way given that people are working from home and changing their patterns?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What was the original target for the reduction in emissions if BusConnects, as proposed, was delivered and how does that vary across the spectrum?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know the NTA is reviewing it at present, but what is the timeframe for the delivery of BusConnects now given the pandemic and have the costs changed for the overall scheme?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to comment on something Mr Creegan said in terms of the routes going to An Bord Plean√°la. Are they going collectively? I had thought there was consideration for a staged process. Are all 16 routes going together?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Good luck with that.
