CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Thank you for that, Mr. Lonergan. Deputy Buckley should feel free to come back in if he wants to. I am conscious Senator Murphy is on the line. Does he want to add anything or does he have any questions on this issue?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Thank you, Senator. I will come in on this, if I may. An application for planning was made in 2003 and here we are in 2022, coming into 2023, 20 years later and the DPI issue is still not resolved. I hear what Mr McGrath is saying about 800-odd other DPIs throughout the country and 25 within Tipperary. It is quite scary that this issue has taken the time, not to mention the cost of coming here, it has to try to be resolved. I am conscious Mr. Coskeran is in the Gallery, and I was not able to interact with him when he was a witness before this committee, but I really shudder to think why this is happening. It is bureaucracy gone mad if it is taking 20 years. I do not lay the blame fully at Tipperary County Council's door, but from 2003 up to 2014, with the establishment of Irish Water, that was a period when the issue was with Tipperary County Council. Following on from that, there was the establishment of Irish Water. I note what has been said, that there is a report being done and that the council applied for funding in 2019, three years ago. I am not sure when the report is to be done. Mr. McGrath might be able to clarify that with the Department. Surely, however, he as chief executive has to agree with me that this is not acceptable and that this has taken an inordinate amount of time. I am conscious that the five houses in Rocksprings we are speaking about are on the hook for the cost of resolution of any issue with infrastructure that would arise in the short to medium term. That is an extreme worry for people. Like Deputy Buckley and Senator Murphy and others, I would regularly deal with requests for taking in charge but rarely have I seen the buck being passed from one organisation to the next and everybody saying it is someone's fault or someone else's issue or we are waiting on this report or that investigation and this site meeting. I would be inclined to have a follow-up meeting within a month with the witnesses present from Tipperary County Council, with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, with Irish Water and with the Department.This is not just about one DPI; it is about a plethora of them and the process relating to them, which is clearly failing. Mr. McGrath listed Rocksprings as No. 4 on the list of priorities for the county. That is to be welcomed, but I shudder to think about what will happen to the priorities from No. 5 all the way through to No. 25 if this is the pace at which these matters are going to be resolved. They cannot all come before the Oireachtas for negotiation. I hope that a streamlined process can be put in place between Irish Water and all of the local authorities to which the 800-odd DPIs relate. Mr. McGrath might come back to me in terms of the timeframe for the deliberation on this report. Ultimately, what kind of timeframe does he envisage in the context of finding a resolution to this issue after 20 years.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McGrath for that clarification in terms of the six-year period. He is right; it is too long, even at six years. That said, and the fact that there is no possibility of providing a timeframe at this juncture, I am conscious that this issue could rumble on for another year for more. Is there any option of even a partial takeover of other services in the interim while the DPI issue is resolved? I am not sure if Mr. McGrath can elaborate on that. On the cost to Tipperary County Council in terms of hours associated with this issue, be it on-site or the need to engage with Irish Water or the EPA. I imagine the cost to the council on this site - Mr. McGrath mentioned that there are 25 such sites in total - is costing Tipperary County Council quite a bit of time and money. I also imagine that it is a distraction in the context of the other work the council needs to be doing vis-Ã -vis housing, etc. In the absence of a timeframe, we could easily be here in six or 12 months' time and the matter would not have progressed any further. I acknowledge Mr. McGrath's comprehensive and transparent statement and his willingness and eagerness to resolve the issue. I commend Mr. Coskeran's patience in trying to navigate the quagmire that seems to be in existence between local government, Irish Water and the EPA. Mr. McGrath might come back on those points and then I will let Deputy Buckley back in.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McGrath. A note would be helpful - certainly in January. if possible - in order to give the committee an indication of how it is progressing. We will take Mr. McGrath up on that offer. On the issue of a partial taking in charge, I do not know if that is one of the interim solutions that could be considered.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	That is fair enough. In terms of the taking-in-charge process, which we are probably all familiar with on this committee, maybe there is the potential for those services the council is in control of to be taken in charge. I assume that the latter would not satisfy Mr. Coskeran. However, it would certainly give some comfort to the residents of the five properties if they were in some way indemnified in the context of issues with other types of infrastructure. I will leave that point to Mr. McGrath. He might send a note to the committee on that when he is providing the briefing, which will be very welcome, in January. I will now hand back to Deputy Buckley.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McGrath for that. I agreed in his absence that would we have the briefing note and update from Tipperary County Council. However I am looking at our schedule and January would be helpful. We would have a meeting ourselves either on 18 January or 25 January, more probably the 18 January. Will Mr. McGrath commit to providing that update for our meeting on 18 January if that is possible?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	For the purpose of the minutes, depending on what kind of update we receive in January, there was also a proposal to have a joint meeting whereby we would request Irish Water, Tipperary County Council, the Department and the EPA, if required, to attend a joint session here early in the new year.
