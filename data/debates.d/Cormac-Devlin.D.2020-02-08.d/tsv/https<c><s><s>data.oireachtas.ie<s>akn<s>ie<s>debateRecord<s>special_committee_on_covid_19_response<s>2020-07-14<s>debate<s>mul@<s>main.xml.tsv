CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Good morning to the witnesses. I thank them for their attendance today. We have all received calls from people in distress and in need of mental health services. I note that approximately 90% of the mental health services are provided through GP care or primary care teams. The remainder are provided by the community mental health teams. What has been the volume of the increase since the outbreak of Covid-19 in Ireland, in particular since mid-March?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the previous question on the WHO recommendation that 12% of health service budgets be spent on mental health services and in Ireland we spend in and around 7% as I heard said. Does Mr. Rogan have a percentage breakdown of the age and gender of those he has seen in the past 12 months or so or has there been an increase in any particular cohort seeking mental health services? Mr. Rogan mentioned young people, for example. One of the common issues we all come across is the dual diagnosis case of those who may have a drug addiction as well as mental health issues. What is the panel's overall view on how we go forward in treating that? Is the lack of funding going into mental health services a barrier to that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank everybody for those responses. We spoke about primary healthcare services. I would say they are patchy, to say the least, in certain parts of the country. My fear is for those who live in areas where they cannot avail of services and also in terms of the strain on GPs across the country. That could create barriers, unfortunately, for those who are trying to access services. That is an important element in terms of either funding to assist with that or for the review of services. I thank Ms Mitchell for her comments on Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone. There is certainly a need to see the implementation of that as soon as possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations today. It was interesting and I thank them for providing the report in advance. I represent Dún Laoghaire in the Dáil and one of the big issues I have had over the years has been the staffing resource for community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 6. It has been difficult to retain and recruit staff in various departments, but I want to look specifically at CAMHS and how the children and adolescent sector is resourced. Will the HSE comment on the overall recruitment process? I do not want to be too parochial but will the HSE comment on how the level of staffing for mental health services has been filled so far?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am conscious of the time but I thank Dr. Doody for that response. I appeal to the director and to the staff from the HSE in particular to keep that focus on south Dublin. I have been aware of the challenges for many years but I ask them to redouble the efforts to retain and recruit staff for the CHO and the wider field. In the earlier session, I raised the issue of dual diagnosis. A problem that arises time and again is in terms of people who have an addiction but who also have mental health issues. Could the witnesses comment on that? Primary healthcare services are patchy, to say the least, across the country. Some areas have a functioning primary healthcare service and a centre but others do not, and that presents challenges. Finally, to the witnesses from the Mental Health Commission, it is stated on page 17 of the report we received in advance of this meeting that the commission was reporting on a weekly basis to the Department of Health. If a second wave of Covid-19 were to hit or just in general the coming weeks or months, is that likely to continue?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On a weekly basis, yes.
