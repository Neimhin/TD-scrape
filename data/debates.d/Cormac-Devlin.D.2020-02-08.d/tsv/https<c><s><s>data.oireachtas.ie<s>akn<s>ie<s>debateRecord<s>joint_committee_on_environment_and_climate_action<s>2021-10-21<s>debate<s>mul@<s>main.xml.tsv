CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for my late arrival. I was next door at another committee meeting.I will not go into other matters because I do not want to go over ground I presume my colleagues have covered. However, I wish to ask about the connection between ETBs and the need to train technicians in order that we can facilitate people who, as Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, want to reuse more and extend the lifelines of products. There is a willingness across the country to do that. If we could supply technicians to help with that, it would be important. Dr. Brennan referred to the WEEE scheme and the White Goods Association working together on how best to efficiently recycle goods, where necessary, and support those who want to extend the lifetime of products. We had a great discussion last week about innovative ways to support communities which do that. My local repair shop is, I think, busier now because people are thinking like that and looking at the volume of items disposed of unnecessarily. The next generation may believe that the previous one was crazy to think of everything as being disposable. Maybe that was a marketing ploy over the past decade or so. Hopefully, this legislation will encourage industry and, more importantly, the public to think and act differently. Dr. Brennan said it is about encouragement if nothing else. The legislation is necessary but it is also about a bit of carrot and less stick. I thank Dr. Brennan and offer my apologies for not being here from the start.
