CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I confirm I am in the convention centre. I thank Mr. Walsh and his colleagues for their attendance. Mr. Walsh mentioned the board's investments in ICT and I note the new website, which is very welcome. However, there are still some teething issues which I want to raise directly, particularly around the SHDs, for as long as they are with us. The issue is the cost of that particular project. To me, it would seem a little late, particularly around the SHDs. I know there are other rationales for having a new website, but the SHDs were brought in back in 2017 yet we only have a new website now in 2021. Will Mr. Walsh outline how much that project cost, when it started and for how long it has been ongoing?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know the board brought in other changes internally but, for the end-user, it was mainly the website. Mr. Walsh might clarify the cost of the website and how long that has been in train.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Ms Killian have a separate cost for the website?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Can Ms Killian make a direct submission on the new website now?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, but for third party appeals to normal planning applications, can people make a-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for all of that. In terms of that cost, a phenomenal amount of money has been spent. I shudder to think how much money was spent prior to 2014. Obviously, either catch-up was being played by the organisation and there was a lack of spend over time, or there was a complete revamp. From the end-user perspective of the website, particularly as I mentioned SHDs, from 2017 on there was very little improvement, if any, in the website's public interface. I am not saying that the staff have not been helpful to the public, and they have. However, from a complete project point of view, when so many applications were coming the way of An Bord Plean√°la through the SHD process, and the strategic infrastructure as well, I question why it is only now, in 2021, that the website has been updated, given that, ironically, the SHDs are going to be phased out at the end of 2021.Mr. Walsh might forward on those costs please after today's session.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How am I doing on time?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I look forward to getting the information.
