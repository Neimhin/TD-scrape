CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our guests. I represent Dún Laoghaire, and I am sure they are very happy for Shannon Foynes Port to be a tier 1 port as opposed to a tier 2 one, given we went through that process previously.I also congratulate the Shannon Foynes Port Company on the funding it has drawn down from the Connecting Europe Facility. Mr. Keating mentioned channel depths of up to 32 m and specifically referenced consistently floating offshore. Is any consideration being given to fixed wind farms? Is there a reason, such as cost or an infrastructural basis, for only floating being explored? In 2013, Shannon Foynes was exploring wave energy, which has not been mentioned yet. Mr. Keating might elaborate on that. He mentioned that the Shannon Foynes Port Company had commissioned a report and €12 billion in supply chain investment was earmarked. A copy of that report might be useful for committee members following on from today's engagement. My third question relates to the other infrastructural projects mentioned in the opening remarks, which is the need for the completion of the Limerick to Foynes Adare bypass road scheme and the Foynes to Limerick railway line. Those two projects in particular are big asks and are running separately to what the port company will ultimately need. How are they progressing? Fibre-optic was also mentioned. Connectivity is obviously very important for the cluster to develop. Education was mentioned. Mr. Keating might give us an update on that. The identification of offshore grid connectivity points is crucial if we are to have floating or other types of wind farms in the estuary. What potential exists for connection to onshore grids?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I also mentioned fibre-optic connectivity and grid connectivity. Will Mr. Hallissey or Mr. Keating reply regarding those items?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses very much for that discussion and for their opening remarks. It has been a really useful discussion for us and certainly extremely interesting. I have three questions, one of which is about energy security and relates to EirGrid specifically. It is good to have its representatives back before the committee. This is something we discussed during their previous time at this committee. Specifically, EirGrid mentioned there is a temporary emergency generation plan for the next three winters, which is extremely welcome considering where we were last October. There was concern about that winter. EirGrid stated then in the opening remarks, however, that this would be operated by relevant market participants outside of the electricity market and only run as required for system stability and system security purposes. The witnesses might elaborate on that to give the committee a sense of what is proposed for the next three winters. Many witnesses referred to gas as a transitional fuel only. Do witnesses foresee gas being used post 2030 in our energy mix for energy security on the island? In terms of the up-front costs and outlay, many of the technologies we discussed today are somewhere in their infancy and others are expanding their capabilities. Will this ultimately mean a reduction in cost for the consumer? I know it is a bit early to say but given the plans that are before us, if it all pans out the way it should, could consumers ultimately see a reduction in the bills?
