CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Recent corporation tax receipts have demonstrated that the Irish economy is rebounding strongly from the shocks of Covid-19 and indeed Brexit, as the Taoiseach alluded to in an earlier response. However, it is a two-track recovery, with businesses in the technology, pharma and financial services doing extremely well, while many businesses in the hospitality, entertainment and event sectors are struggling. The Government's commitment to these sectors and their employees is appreciated. However, the latest round of restrictions is having a significant impact on these businesses. Can the Taoiseach provide an update on recent engagements with these sectors and an indication of when targeted supports will be introduced?
