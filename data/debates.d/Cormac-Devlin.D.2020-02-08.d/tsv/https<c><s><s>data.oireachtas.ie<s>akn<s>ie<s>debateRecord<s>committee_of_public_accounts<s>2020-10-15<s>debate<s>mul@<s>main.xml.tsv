CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I offer apologies for my colleague, Deputy McAuliffe. I thank the witnesses for attending. I appreciate it. I am aware they appeared before this committee in June 2018 to deal with the financial statements from 2016 regarding the nursing homes support scheme. I will mention some of the recommendations as a result of that meeting. Recommendation 1 states:It is not clear that the cost of care in public nursing homes is providing value for money to the taxpayer. Of a budget in the region of €1 billion for the Nursing Home Support Scheme, approximately two thirds is expended on public nursing homes that provide one fifth of capacity.The Department of Health commenced a value for money review, which I note has been referred to earlier. That was concluded in May 2019. How soon do the witnesses think that is going to be published? Do they have any more information for the members of the committee? It appears to be dragging its heels. Indeed, that issue is still live and relevant since the witnesses' last appearance before the committee. Recommendation 2 states, "The National Treatment Purchase Fund’s review of its pricing mechanism for long-term residential care in private and voluntary nursing homes is ongoing." It also refers to increasing the transparency of the current price mechanism and continuing to ensure value for money for the taxpayer. Again, something similar is referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report today, regarding the lack of review of charges. If I understood the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening remarks, just two reviews were conducted by the chief executive. I am open to correction on that, but he might clarify why that is the case. In terms of the internal appeals process, what changes have been made to those since the witnesses' last appearance before the committee?Transparency about negotiations with nursing homes and how fair deal agreements are arrived at with individual homes is in question. We need to ensure that funding is based on the need of those who are in care and not necessarily whether they are in a public or private home. What changes can the NTPF assure us it has made in the intervening period and what changes does it intend to make now that, in light of Tuesday's budget, the funding has changed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Sloyan. We have limited time. Regarding the transparency of internal reviews and the appeals process, what changes have been made since the NTPF was previously before the Committee of Public Accounts?
