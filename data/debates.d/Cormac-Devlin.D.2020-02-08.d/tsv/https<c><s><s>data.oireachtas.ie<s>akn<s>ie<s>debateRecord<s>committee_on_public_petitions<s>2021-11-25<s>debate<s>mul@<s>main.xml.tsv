CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and I thank them for the opening statement. I, too, join colleagues in paying tribute to those who have lost their lives in the tragedy in the English Channel. If ever we needed a reminder of the need for a robust and efficient asylum system that is it. We know of other European countries that have been dealing with this on a daily basis, unfortunately, and of the loss of life at sea of those who are trying to cross waters. I join with the comments of the Chairman and others in that regard. I thank Ms Buckley for her opening remarks in respect of which I have a number of questions. There has been a significant improvement in the engagement of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, with Members of the Oireachtas from the appointments system to updates on queries. I have experienced this myself. It is important to put that on the record. Like me, new Members of the House since 2020 have been grappling with the pandemic since then. The engagement from the INIS has, as I said, improved over the past number of months.  Ms Buckley mentioned that the new system should be operational by 2024. Given everything that we have experienced, that people are remote working and that the INIS system is in the main paper based, is that still on track? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Buckley specifically referred to the staff and thanked them for their work and the way they did it during the pandemic. My experience showed they were very much engaged and were able to correspond with us and our queries. That was also true for members of the public who engaged with them. I know that there were pressures there. Given what Ms Buckley has said about the volume of paper they deal with ordinarily, it is only right that we acknowledge the way in which they worked. I want to put that on the record today. ICT was one of the main recommendations in the review. Ms Buckley mentioned cases that were backlogged or had been hanging around for some time. Were any cases lost due to paper-based files? Is there an idea of the cost of the introduction of an ICT system? From what Ms Buckley said about the existing capabilities or lack thereof, it will have to be built from scratch.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No doubt we will discuss that in time. How am I for time?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The end-to-end review process of the IPO and IPAT was mentioned. Apart from the finding on ICT, how many findings were there? How will they be introduced or is this already happening?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It does give us a clearer picture.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will start with the prioritisation of cases that are agreed with the UNHCR. The witnesses said this was updated last June. How does that process work and how often does that co-ordination happen?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the website. The new immigration website is online and it looks wonderful but there is still the question of the old website.My suggestion is that we would be greeted by a portal combining the old information and a current application, because while the banner runs along all the pages saying that there is a new website, as of July of this year, I suggest that just in case that was missed, perhaps the Department would look at a front portal that would give the old and new websites, or some way of doing that. However, that is neither here nor there. In terms of the new application and the chatbots to which Senator Murphy referred, how many languages are available on the new website for people to engage with?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, of course.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I could not see any when I went onto the site. That is a barrier in itself that we want to try to eradicate. A couple of weeks or a couple of months is a big timeline. Does Mr. Delaney have an estimated time of when the site will go live?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Delaney. He might correspond with the committee when that is done as it is a matter of interest to us. We have raised it before in one of our engagements with the Ombudsman. I thank Ms Buckley for raising the programme boards. She was obviously aware that we were asking questions about it. I had a few questions to raise about the two programme boards. I was worried about duplication, but Ms Buckley has clarified that in her opening statement. In her opening statement, she also referred to the ministerial decisions unit and that negative decisions were suspended for a period. I presume the unit is up and running again. How many cases were impacted during the suspension?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is what Ms Buckley is telling is us that, in theory, there is a tsunami of negative decisions due to be released?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There are some hundreds.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	When did the decision take place to suspend the issuance of negative decisions?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am just thinking about the recipients. If I were an applicant who was being refused, no news normally means good news. Ms Buckley can see where I am going with this. She also mentioned timing in respect of schooling. We sometimes get cases where a student is in a local school and people want the individual to remain in the State. If all of these letters are to go out, presumably at once-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know. I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I saw that facility on the website. I will ask one more question and make a comment. Ms Buckley mentioned the undocumented. My understanding is that a process was due to begin in mid to late December but she referred to 2022. Which is it? Is it starting at the end of this year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. I thank Ms Buckley for that. In her opening remarks, she mentioned the outcome of the review.There will be another review of all the changes that have been made and a decision will be made around the end of 2022 on that, on whether additional resources and measures are needed, and on any significant issues around legacy cases. I hope we will engage before then, but if not, I suggest that, once the review has concluded and there is a report, we have an engagement on the review process. I am interested in the iteration of the website, the improvement and the functionality of it and the internal information and communications technology, ICT, processes the witnesses spoke about, as well as other improvements and measures taken in the witnesses' office, which I commend. It would be good for the committee to keep on this issue and engage with the witnesses on it in late 2022 or just after that. I thank the witnesses for their attendance.
