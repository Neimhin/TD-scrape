CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Government's progress on delivering a just transition as Ireland implements a low carbon future. At the heart of the policy is recognition that families and communities must be supported and protected against the negative impacts of the transition away from fossil fuels. Key to supporting these initiatives is funding and we have seen €84.5 million secured from the EU's just transition fund for investment in longer-term transition over the coming decade. The fund will be complemented by Exchequer funding, which is welcome. I have been a long-standing supporter of retrofitting schemes and I welcome the Government's national retrofitting scheme. However, I am concerned about the delays in progress and about the capacity of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to roll it out at scale. I am also concerned about the lack of progress in retrofitting and improving our local authority housing stock, particularly in advance of what will be a very difficult winter. I ask the Minister to redouble efforts in this area to ensure that the local authorities have funding available to implement quick fixes as they prepare for a more extensive programme over the course of the decade. Recent changes to the better energy warmer homes scheme to expand eligibility for home owners in receipt of the disability allowance for over six months and who have a child under seven are extremely welcome. I ask the Minister to make a concerted effort to highlight these new opportunities.  I ask the Minister to examine the effectiveness of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to ensure it has sufficient resources to police energy companies and to ensure that customers are being offered the best rate. I have had reports of consumers being told certain products or special electricity rates would not suit them when it is clear from any objective analysis that they would be better off. I would also ask for arrangements and regulations around the district heating schemes to be examined. I have had reports of some district heating customers receiving notice of a fourfold increase in natural gas rates but as district heating customers, they have no power to change supplier.  As we move towards a low carbon economy, it is critical that people at risk of fuel and energy poverty or communities at risk of economic disadvantage are supported. The Government's medium and long-term strategy is sound but I would like to see more ambition in the short term.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Bill 2021. I thank the Minister and her officials for bringing the legislation before the House. I will be supporting this Bill which will bring Garda compensation claims within the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, process. The Bill is aimed at decreasing the length of time it takes for disposing of a Garda compensation claim from initial application to award by providing for clear time limits for each stage of the process. The new process is also aimed at ensuring that avenues for settlement and resolution are available at the earliest possible stage. Where cases end up before the courts, they can be dealt with at the appropriate level, not necessarily the High Court, which can speed up the process and reduce legal costs. Hopefully the Bill will simplify the system for gardaí who suffer an injury during the course of their duty. I want to use this occasion to pay tribute to gardaí for the work they do not only across the country, but in each individual community, particularly in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire where I recently had the pleasure of joining serving and retired gardaí and their families at events in Shankill and Dún Laoghaire Garda stations to mark the beginning of the centenary year of the first Civic Guards coming to Dún Laoghaire. Of course, the first policing presence in the area was established in 1836 with the founding of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, DMP, force. The first DMP officers in Dún Laoghaire were based at a facility on Cumberland Street, before moving to 100 Upper George’s Street in 1839. The police presence at 100 Upper George’s Street continued for over 150 years, when the Garda moved to its current station on Corrig Avenue in 1992. Over the years, hundreds of gardaí have served with distinction in the area. At last week's commemoration, we remembered the 83 fallen gardaí who made the ultimate sacrifice. We also remembered their colleagues who were severely injured in the course of carrying out their duties. Last week I had the great pleasure to meet the senior surviving garda from the old Dún Laoghaire station, Murt Gleeson, along with other former members who provided outstanding service to the community over the years including retired inspector Pat Neill and soon to be retired Detective Superintendent Martin Creighton and others. As we enter a very sensitive period of commemorations, I thank the Garda centenary committee in Dún Laoghaire for their efforts, led by Inspector Adrian Kelly, Garda John Paul Durkan, Garda David L’Estrange, Garda Caroline Sheridan, Garda Gemma Conway, Detective Garda Jim Mulligan and reserve Garda Kieran Browne, along with retired members, Eamon Hession, Angeline Conefry and of course Ed Ryan who did so much work researching the history of the Garda Síochána in Dún Laoghaire and Shankill. There will be other commemorations at Blackrock and other Garda stations, to mark the fantastic work done by gardaí over the past 100 years. As move to the second century of the Garda Síochána in Dún Laoghaire, I ask the Minister to raise the issue of facilities in the area with the Garda Commissioner. This has been discussed previously and considered by Garda headquarters in Phoenix Park. There has been exceptional population growth along the Luas green line, particularly from Carrickmines to Sandyford. It is estimated that almost 30,000 new residents will soon be living in this area. A new Garda station at Cherrywood is badly needed and I know it is open for consideration. So too is the need for a more modern station. The station in Dún Laoghaire was built in the 1990s. Given the increasing demographic in the area, it also needs modernisation. I hope the Minister will take that back to discuss with the Commissioner. I thank the Minister for staying for the full debate and listening to the views and considerations of Members. I hope all Members across the House will support this important legislation. It is not only important for the Garda but also important for the State.
