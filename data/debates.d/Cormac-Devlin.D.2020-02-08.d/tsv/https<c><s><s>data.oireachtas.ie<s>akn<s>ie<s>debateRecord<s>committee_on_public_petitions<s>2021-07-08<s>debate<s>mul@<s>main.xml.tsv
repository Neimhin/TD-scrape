CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am in the convention centre, so apologies for all the bells. At the outset, I wish to thank both Mr. Henderson and Dr. Lannon for their presentations. Apologies for not joining the meeting earlier; I was in the Chamber. I ask the witnesses to forgive me if I go over questions that have been covered. I heard some of the questions being asked, but I have a few of my own. As others have said, the Ombudsman for Children appeared before the committee previously and we had a good discussion around the White Paper. The witnesses have referenced that in many of their replies. It is important to have that tangible document to work towards it in a speedy fashion. Protection accommodation, and specifically, AHBs, were mentioned in the opening remarks. I ask the witnesses to go into more detail on their thinking on those as specific bodies for accommodation. Equally, I heard the witnesses speak of the issue of individuals sitting idly. I am very aware of that. Dr. Lannon mentioned Doras being in operation for 21 years. I recall that perhaps 18 years ago, accommodation was provided for minors who were coming into Sandycove in my constituency of DÃºn Laoghaire. Local people set up a football club for those minors. It created a great sense of integration between local teen, early teens and many of the unaccompanied minors. When we speak about activities, entertainment and genuine integration, there is nothing like sport, music and other similar activities. That brings me onto my next question. What type of activities and entertainment are available for those who are in many of these centres? I am aware that the witnesses have said that there is a hierarchy of needs and there are needs that are greater than that.  The witnesses have mentioned mental health and suicide, which is extremely worrying. I believe I heard them say that some applicants are 15 times more likely to be diagnosed with mental health problems. That is a staggering figure. Do the witnesses have statistics on the age range of individuals that we are talking about, and equally, what services are available for them? The witnesses mentioned HIQA and the need for HIQA inspections. Obviously, if the White Paper takes off, many of these issues could fall away. However, there will need to be a system of inspections in place. I was a member of the Special Oireachtas Committee on Covid-19 Response last year. We heard about the lack of inspections in some accommodation centres. That, in itself, is worrying. We have seen other issues in relation to nursing homes. From the witnesses' perspective, what needs to change in that arena?  Senator Eugene Murphy mentioned integration and Deputy Buckley mentioned food and culture. I recall being at a school fair a few years ago. What struck me was that the food and elements of the culture of all nationalities represented in the school were on display. Again, that sent a signal of true integration. These children were celebrating their cultures and being proud of where they are from, yet they were loving living in Ireland. That is what we need to embrace. In referencing my own constituency, we used to have a festival of world cultures, which was extremely well publicised and known right across the world. Unfortunately, it grew too big for one local authority area to take on. It pointed to the need to celebrate culture, diversity and integration. My final question concerns education. The issue is one that comes up now and again and I am sure both organisations are well aware of it. It concerns individuals who are in education and are told one day that they are being relocated to perhaps another part of the country. That obviously has a huge and devastating impact on those individuals. We spoke of mental health problems earlier on. I can only assume that such instances of relocation would compound such problems. The Department has acted compassionately in some cases, but I am sure the witnesses are aware of others where that did not happen. Perhaps they might touch on that in their responses. I thank them both for their presentations; they were most interesting.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the same issue as Senator Murphy, as you are Chair of this committee and since we serve on the same committee, I did not hear the radio interview but I read about it in a newspaper recently. I have to say I was shocked by your alleged remarks. As I said, I did not hear them. I would like you to clarify them, be that here today if we have time or, certainly, in a public forum. The article I read is unsettling and the matter needs to be addressed, obviously, by yourself, because the article related to you. I am sure you know the one I am talking about. Other members have spoken on it as well. I await to hear from you on that, Chair. Thank you.
