CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Moloney and I congratulate him on his appointment. I have been listening to colleagues’ questions, some of which I would like to touch on again. I will go back to the issue of secondment of people who are from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and who are ensconced into other Departments. One was referenced by Deputy Murphy earlier in relation to the Department of Health. I think Mr. Moloney said the figure was 17 in his own Department and that 19 had gone out-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know they are across other Departments and other agencies. Is it the practice of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to have colleagues from its Department based in other Departments for the purpose of oversight of annual expenditure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate and know that. It is not in every Department.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is based primarily based on the annual accounts and the Department is monitoring their expenditure from the outturn versus what was estimated in the Vote or in the budget.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Those Departments that have a high expenditure include the Department of Health and the Department of Social Protection. What other ones are there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will turn to the 2020 Vote 11 accounts and specifically to note 1: operating cost statement 2020. In one section, Mr. Moloney outlines the expenditure borne that is elsewhere, which includes notional rents. That figure is static between 2020 and 2019. Could Mr. Moloney outline what that relates to, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is on page eight, just for reference.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is why it is a fixed rate.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I was going to ask how many properties there are. Is Mr. Moloney saying that it is only those on Merrion Row?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Staying with Vote 11, section 2.3 deals with other debt balances. I assume that there are recuperable expenses. There are salaries, travel expenses, travel pass expenditure and other debit suspense items. What struck me was the difference between the 2019 and 2020 figure under recuperable travel pass expenditure. Was that primarily down to Covid-19 and to fewer staff claiming for that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Again, staying with Vote 11, on page 14, there is the postal and telecommunications services from within the Department. There was astronomical outturn, when compared to the figure of 2020. The provision for 2020, I presume again was in relation to Covid-19, was €22,000 and yet the outturn was €14,000. I presume the annual running of that line figure is approximately €200,000 per annum, based on the 2019 figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would explain the difference.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That explains that. Let us turn to the issue of the new office. I have a question on it. Some 30% of the OGCIO’s programme expenditure related to pay and that is understandable. Its next largest expenditure was on ICT services, which accounted for approximately 68% of overall expenditure. Is that an initial set-up cost and a once-off or is there an ongoing reliance on expenditure for ICT within that new office?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Correct.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Since its establishment in 2013, would the ICT spend be that high on a year-on-year basis?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That explains that. I thank Ms O'Donohue for her response. Colleagues asked questions about pension payments. The witnesses answered some of those questions on superannuation, which is welcome. It was mentioned that there was a 3.9% increase in the number of pensions year on year. I presume that will increase further in the coming years. A colleague referred to pension numbers not being accurately predicted year on year, although I know it is difficult to do so. How will expenditure grow over the coming years? Obviously, there are estimations, so what will be the extent of growth in superannuation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That puts it into context. I noted the reference to ex gratia pension payments for widows and children. The amount decreased from €303,000 in 2019 to €253,000 in 2020. What number of ex gratia payments have been made?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Pender have an approximation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Per year.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Pender.
