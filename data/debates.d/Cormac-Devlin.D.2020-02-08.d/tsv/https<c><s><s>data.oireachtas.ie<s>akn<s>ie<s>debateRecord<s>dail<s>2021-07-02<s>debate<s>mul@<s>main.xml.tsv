CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is nice to be back in this Chamber. I hope it will be possible to return to Leinster House in September. I speak about the vaccination programme this morning in a totally different context from when I have spoken previously. I acknowledge the 5,000 people who have sadly passed away during the pandemic and I express my condolences to their families, friends and loved ones. Anyone who watched last nightâ€™s "Prime Time" programme on nursing homes will have been struck by the sense of sadness and anger at conditions in some of the nursing homes. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Butler's, comments about investigating the issue. As a member of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, I also support a public inquiry into the issues raised. There will be others. News of a fourth wave of the pandemic, driven by the Delta variant, has come as a disappointment, both here in this Chamber and across the country. We all hoped that this pandemic was in our rear-view mirror but we must prepare once again as a society as we face into a fourth wave for the impact it will have on our society, economy and health service. It is devastating news for the hospitality sector. I urge all Ministers to work together to find an innovative solution in the period ahead, including antigen testing, which I have spoken about before. I hope there will be no need to roll back the easing of restrictions that has been achieved to date. Thankfully, Ireland is well placed to face a fourth wave. More than 4.1 million doses have been administered. About 67% of adults have now had their first jab with almost 45% fully vaccinated. We are told by EU and Irish medical experts that all four vaccines licensed in the EU are extremely effective against the Delta variant. This is extremely reassuring. Uptake of the vaccine has been extraordinary. It is at 99% for people over 80, 98% for people in their 70s, and 92% for people aged 60 to 69. This is well ahead of EU averages which are as low as 76% in many states. I am hopeful that our extremely high uptake in older people and people with underlying health conditions will pay dividends as the fourth wave begins to be established. The vaccines also appear to limit the transmission of the Delta variant. Therefore, it is critical that we accelerate the vaccination programme with all possible speed. I welcome the Minister's comments that the portal will open from next Friday for people aged 30 to 34. News that experts on the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, have approved the use of AstraZeneca and the one-shot Janssen vaccine for everyone over 18 if they wish to be vaccinated early is also welcome. I note the Minister's comments this morning about the opt-in for that cohort. The reduction in the interval between AstraZeneca vaccine doses to four weeks is welcome. I know many people in the 60 to 69 cohort are still awaiting their second jab and are hoping for an appointment in the next two weeks. I ask NIAC to explore having an opt-in for the over 60 cohort if there are excess vaccines because a number expressed concern about the option facing them about what vaccine they were getting. I urge the Minister to ask NIAC to decide on vaccinations for children aged 12 to 15, especially those who would otherwise fall into group 4 or group 7, with a serious underlying condition that puts them at risk. I have raised this matter before and I understand that many hospital consultants have lists prepared and are awaiting the decision and that the HSE is drawing up plans. I note the European Medicines Agency, EMA, approved the measure some time ago. The Minister might come back to me about whether NIAC cited any reason for what seems to be an undue delay. We need to offer these children a vaccination as soon as possible and certainly before the return to school in September.The Minister might also confirm if he expects most teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to be fully vaccinated before the return to school.  I join with the Minister in expressing my gratitude and that of the House to all those working on, and administering, the vaccination programme across the now 40 national centres, pharmacies and other healthcare centres. Feedback has been very positive, but I ask the Minister to ensure there are proper facilities for people with disabilities. I will forward details to the Minister of feedback I have received in this regard. It is wonderful to see 692,000 vaccinations arrive this week, with another 1 million due over the course of July and more again in August. I wish everyone involved in the programme every success as they ramp up administration to protect Ireland from the worst effects of a potential fourth wave. The Minister's comments on this morning's "Morning Ireland", and in his opening speech this morning, are welcome. It seems that a lot of work and preparation has gone into what is facing us in the next couple of months. Hopefully, with the co-operation of all in this House, we can put out positive messages, get engagement and keep the co-operation of the public as we face into the next couple of months.
