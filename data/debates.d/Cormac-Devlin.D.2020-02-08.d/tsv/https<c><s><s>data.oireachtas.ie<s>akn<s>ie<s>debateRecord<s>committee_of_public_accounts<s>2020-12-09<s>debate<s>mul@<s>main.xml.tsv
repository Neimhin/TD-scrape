CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses. I note Ms McPhillips in her opening remarks stated that the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, had collected €1.6 million under the proceeds or crime legislation and €2 million in Revenue seizures, and assets of €64.9 million were frozen in 2019, €53 million from crypto-currency, compared to €8.4 million in 2018. Have there been specific new targets from CAB from 2018 to 2019? It appears all these figures have increased. Ms McPhillips might give the committee more information on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms McPhillips said there were 31 cases in 2019. Is that the largest to date brought forward by CAB?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would like to focus on two other items. In the Appropriation Accounts there are a number of headings detailing different programmes from Ms McPhillips's Department. When she is corresponding with the committee, I would appreciate if she could give us more information on each of those. It is those mainly where there are significant variations. If Ms McPhillips could detail those because we would like to know more about many of those schemes and projects. Also, one of the briefing documents states that the Department is compliant with the exception of 22 contracts to a value of €5.7 million. It also states these contracts are considered non-competitive and non-compliant as they were extended beyond the original contract date without a new competitive process, the details of which are as follows: four contracts with a value of €1.06 million; 16 contracts with a value of €4.08 million; and two contracts with a value of €558,000. What happened in those instances?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What about the other four?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that tranche of contracts something that would recur annually because the Department is waiting on the new framework? Is that more or less how that happens?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No. Obviously, not.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would hope there are procedures in place to try to minimise that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is a sizeably amount of money and it has been flagged. Regarding the justice and policing transformation programme, I note there was an estimation provision of €10 million and only €6.1 million was spent. Can Ms McPhillips elaborate on why that was underspent?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is a considerable underspend under crime prevention measures. A estimated provision of €1.19 million was due to be spent for 2019 but the outturn was €411,000. What was the discrepancy there? Why was the full budget not spent?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The intention was to spend that provision. Spending under that category would impact many communities across the country.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Thank you.
