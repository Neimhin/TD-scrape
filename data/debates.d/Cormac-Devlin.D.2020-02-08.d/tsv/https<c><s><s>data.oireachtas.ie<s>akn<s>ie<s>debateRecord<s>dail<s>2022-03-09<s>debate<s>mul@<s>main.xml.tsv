CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for taking this question on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who I know cannot be here. This is a very important and pressing issue in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire. I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte's ongoing efforts and engagements with the families, the staff and service users of Dunmore House and Carmona Services, particularly throughout the pandemic. She has been very generous with her time, engaging on Zoom and attending on-site meetings with those involved. However, parents, guardians and friends of Carmona Services have been in contact with me in recent days and they are very concerned. Not only were they concerned prior to this latest twist in respite care locally, but they were concerned about the waiting list for respite care generally in community healthcare organisation, CHO 6. They were advised through written correspondence from the HSE and St. John of God that a respite house in Wyattville Park has been allocated solely to one individual, which is as a result of a court case. While we acknowledge and understand the need to allocate that property to one individual, it is obviously needed, there is now a situation in which 88 people are waiting for respite, as well as an additional 33 people on a waiting list. Many of their respite hours are in jeopardy because this property was a key tool in respite within the area and for those families. It is the only respite house available to those 88 people with intellectual disabilities. This is causing extreme distress and hardship to families. Some have been offered alternative respite 130 km away in County Wexford, which is obviously not suitable. I know the Minister of State recently committed €9 million for the provision of respite care, which is very welcome, but we have a situation in CHO 6, Dún Laoghaire, Dublin south-east and north Wicklow, whereby we have lost key respite services. It is causing significant distress to parents and families. Just as we are beginning to return to some level of normality, they have no clarity on respite services. Will the Minister of State engage with officials in her Department, the HSE and St. John of God to expedite the purchase of a new respite property? I know this cannot be done overnight, but the letter is quite vague in that regard. It alludes to the purchase and provision of more respite services, which were needed anyway, but this problem has exacerbated the issue facing these families and the individuals with intellectual disabilities. Can we fast-track the purchase of a property and all that entails with planning and retrofitting? It is an issue of real urgency and that is why I raise it today.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for her reply and for a copy of her statement. I specifically did not mention Ravenswell initially because it is part of the problem but that was before the latest news about Wyattville Park. The challenges that have faced Ravenswell have been there for quite some time, and recruitment was an issue long before it became an issue generally in every sector in society. I will come back to that again directly with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is aware of it. In her statement, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, said that, occasionally, respite services must be temporarily curtailed, which is understood and, unfortunately, families have witnessed that over the years. She said that the HSE has requested information from St. John of God Services about creating a list for priority. That is welcome but her statement goes on to say that, over the next six months, communication will issue to all individuals outlining the detail proposed for supported holidays, including any transition plans that are required. I ask, through the Minister of State, that the Department of Health make urgent contact with the HSE specifically around speeding up that process. There is no lack of resources within the Department of Health or the HSE to try to assist St. John of God's. This is having an enormous impact on families in south-east Dublin and north Wicklow. This news came as a bolt from the blue to them but, as I said, they have been impacted for so long by the impact of changes in respite care that many of the families cannot even plan six days in advance, let alone six weeks in advance, because they do not know when respite is coming. They do know one thing for sure, which is that respite is not coming for the foreseeable future for any of the individuals who were allocated to Wyattville Park. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, through the Department of Health, to try to speed up the process as much as possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome this initiative by the Government to tackle the skyrocketing rate of inflation we are witnessing, as all consumers are right across the globe. It should be recognised by all Members of this House that this is yet another constructive measure by this Government to assist those struggling individuals, households and businesses at this difficult time. Everyone is affected, not least those on low income and social welfare. For those in jeopardy of falling into a poverty trap, this year's budget, which was announced just last October, contained more than €1 billion in significant tax and social welfare measures to assist those middle- and low-income earners. Those measures were recognised by the Economic and Social Research Institute as progressive but I would be first to say they cannot be stand-alone measures and they must be kept under constant review over the coming weeks and months. It is true to say that nobody could have foreseen what the world would be facing in early 2022 last October, with the rate of inflation far exceeding what was anticipated at that time. The worry at that time was simply the post-pandemic supply chain disruption and inflationary cycle. Sadly, as we exit the pandemic, we are confronted with the invasion of a sovereign state of Ukraine, which presents many challenges not only to Ireland but to other nations too. It presents challenges on several fronts domestically from a humanitarian, educational, energy, health, food and financial perspective. As was said last October and earlier today as well, this volatile inflationary period in which we are currently locked is being kept under review by the Government, which I welcome. All levers of the economy are being examined and they should be kept under constant review. It is not good enough for some Members of the House to just use sound bites. We need solutions and we need the Opposition and the Government to work collaboratively. Last week, President Higgins signed into law the legislation for the emergency benefit scheme for electricity costs. That will see an important package of more than €500 million to allow for a €200 energy credit for more than 2.1 million homes across the State, along with a much-needed lump sum payment of €125 for those in receipt of fuel allowance. Tonight, the Government is bringing forward a €320 million package on excise that will see, if it is passed this evening, a price reduction in petrol, diesel and marked gas oil from tomorrow until at least Wednesday, 31 August. The public expects the Members of this House to work together. We are at an early stage of an extremely volatile time internationally and it is incumbent on all Deputies to work together and do what we can. We must try to quell the inflationary cycle we are in and the Government must work with all Deputies. Price gouging and any profiteering must be investigated. Those steps must be taken sooner rather than later.
