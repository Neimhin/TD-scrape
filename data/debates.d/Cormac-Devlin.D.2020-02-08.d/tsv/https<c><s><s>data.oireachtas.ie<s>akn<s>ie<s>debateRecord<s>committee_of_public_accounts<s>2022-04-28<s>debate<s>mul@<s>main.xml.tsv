CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses, some of whom have been before the committee previously. They are very welcome back. In the time that I have, I will focus first and foremost on the Comptroller and Auditor General's remarks and opening statement and specifically on non-compliance in the context of Vote 21 and 24. A number of reasons have been provided for that non-compliance.I note that in Vote 21 there were 16 contracts totalling €15.5 million. Some of those projects went beyond the original contract date and others were rolled over. What procedures have now been put in place to deal with those issues?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Votes 21 and 24.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is good to hear that such progress has been made. Are any of the contracts under Vote 21 or Vote 24 long running? Are any of them contracts that have been in place for more than five years? I know Ms McCaffrey said some of those contracts have been put out to tender, which is good and probably best practice, but have any of those contracts been rolling for more than five years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms McCaffrey might come back to the committee on that point.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will turn to the Probation Service and consider an issue that we, as parliamentarians, engage with from time to time. Is there a written service level agreement in place between the Department and the Probation Service?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Sullivan. Our guests might be able to advise if there has been an increase in the referrals received by the Probation Service. Have our guests a breakdown of the most recurring offences that have been referred?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Do we have detail on which community service programmes are being engaged in that regard? I do not know if Ms McPhillips has that information to hand.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms McPhillips might send that information to the committee. There seems to be a lack of engagement between the Probation Service and local authorities on work that is required and could be done within the community. That could assist the Probation Service.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	When does Ms McPhillips hope that piece of work will be concluded?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That community service aspect was patchy in the run-up to the onset of the pandemic and stopped thereafter.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is correct.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Sullivan for that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will turn now to consider compensation and legal costs, specifically table 6.2 in the document relating to Vote 21. I am struck by the number of claims that have been made by prisoners for injury and other actions involving prisoners. There are 445 claims of that kind and more than €2 million has been awarded in compensation. There are 107 civil claims for injuries received while on duty and other issues involving prison staff, which is a high number. There are 110 claims through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal arising out of injuries received by prison staff. Have our guests the figures for recent years that we could use as a comparison? Has that trend increased? The number of prisoner claims seems high. Have those numbers increased or decreased?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What about the prisoners' claims? Does Ms McCaffrey have a percentage breakdown of the types of claims they are making? I heard what she said about sanitation but can she give us examples of other types of claims that are being made?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Please do. A percentage breakdown would be helpful.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to pick up where I left off from the previous session. Much has been said about Thornton Hall and it is also referenced in the Comptroller and Auditor General's comments. I note the expenditure on the construction in Limerick, which is very welcome. What is being done regarding Mountjoy Prison? What are the plans to upgrade Mountjoy Prison?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the timeframe for that to be utilised?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It should be acknowledged that it was particularly difficult for the staff in the Prison Service during the pandemic. There were certain scenarios that could be accommodated and some that could not. However, I acknowledge the work of the Prison Service in engaging with both families and public representatives in that regard. That is good news about Mountjoy and the Dóchas centre. Turning to Vote 24, I have a number of questions on different headings and I will ask them in the time I have remaining. Subhead D3 is social disadvantage measures, and there was an underspend of nearly €1 million. Some of that was obviously down to Covid-19 but it also refers to certain projects for youth justice not being fully drawn down in 2020, related to the delays in establishing new projects. How are we getting on with that at this point?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good. With regard to the Property Services Regulatory Authority, I found it very problematic during the pandemic, obviously because staff were working remotely. There is a slight overspend there of €162,000. Is that service fully operational again now?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What about recruitment?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, because that was an issue. What is the update on the gambling regulatory authority?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Department is going to appoint a CEO-designate.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. In theory, how long is it before we expect to have somebody if the recruitment process is successful?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good to know. The next two matters are linked. They are the funding for prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence as well as funding for services for victims of crime. I note the services to the victims of crime increased during the pandemic for obvious reasons, unfortunately, as did the expenditure relating to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Can Ms McPhillips give us an outline of the expenditure there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is to be hoped that we will see an increase in that funding in the Department into the future because it is something that is really needed. The pandemic just exposed it. It does not mean it is going to go away, as Ms McPhillips knows. It exacerbated the problem.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ultimately, there is this clear sign that victims need these services. They availed of the services due to probably extreme duress and stress, but we certainly need to look at that. I will leave that in Ms McPhillips's capable hands.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. I thank the witnesses.
