CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Makhlouf and Mr. O'Connor are very welcome. I have three questions for Mr. Makhlouf. The Central Bank's quarter 3 bulletin shows the bank's anticipation of a 9% contraction in GDP for 2020 but a return to growth of 5.7% next year. My first question is on whether Mr. Makhlouf, as Governor, considered the impact of a potential second wave on the stability of the financial system. Has stress-testing been done for the banks? Is Mr. Makhlouf satisfied that they have robust capital reserves?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The issue of insurance policies has been to the fore over the past number of weeks, particularly business interruption insurance. We are hearing widespread reports of insurance companies failing to pay out for claims on business interruption insurance. What is Mr. Makhlouf's view on this and what is the insurance supervision directorate of the Central Bank doing to ensure insurance companies act fairly? Will the Central Bank review this policy?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I applaud the Governor's efforts. Hopefully, they will continue. I thank Mr. Makhlouf for that because, as he states, it is a real issue facing many businesses. It has come to the surface more as they start to reopen and go back into operation. The Governor outlined two scenarios: a return to growth and that of a more pessimistic view. What is the Governor's view about the impact of both on the housing market here for the foreseeable future?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. I will turn to Mr. O'Connor quickly. The recent bond issuance at a low or negative yield is welcome. I acknowledge the work of the NTMA, only made possible with the ECB keeping the interest rates low. Mr. O'Connor mentioned that he expected interest rates to remain low for the foreseeable future, with the risk of rates increasing in the future. What consideration is being given to very long-term bonds, such as 30, 50 or 100 years, to deal with this once-in-100 year event?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Connor.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses today and thank them for their time and their opening remarks. I do not think anybody can underestimate the challenges faced by schools. The immediate question facing parents, in particular, in March when the schools closed was how long this was going to last. Ultimately, as it went on longer and longer, the question turned to how this is going to change and how the schools are going to reopen. I welcome the remarks and I heard Mr. Mongey this morning on radio outlining some of the challenges. I want to put on record my own appreciation for many teachers who have done exemplary work in these challenging times. Mr. Mongey mentioned in his opening remarks the issue of equity for schools. We have to recognise that not every school, not every learner and not every child has the same access, unfortunately, to the equipment required to have what Mr. Mongey termed "blended learning".Online is no substitute for the classroom and we need to get to the point of flushing out all those issues. The resource bundle dated July of this year includes 194 checks, many of which point to the school leaders looking for supports within the school. I get nervous when I see that because those are 194 reasons not to reopen schools. While I welcome the positive guarded comments about reopening schools, and it is important to start from that position, parents, in particular, want to know how and when it will be done. I speak as a father of three, but having been contacted by countless parents who have been in the position, either trying to work from home or maybe doing shift work from home, of trying to teach their children. The international evidence shows the continued closure of schools will have an impact on our children. That is why I emphasise the need to reopen, particularly, as I have said, where children do not have access to IT equipment. It is critical that schools reopen. In the view of each of the organisations, what exactly is required to open our schools come September?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Mongey is there on screen, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will ask Mr. Clerkin the same question. I will add to it what Mr. Mongey referred to, namely, the additional cost. Every business that reopened and any entity that has had to reopen to the public incurred additional costs. One would accept that, but there is also a requirement of additional space stated in the roadmap. Mr. Clerkin might touch on it. Certain schools had plans for school extensions that were due to be constructed over the summer months and that did not happen.Portakabins were also due to arrive, but that may not be happening. I would like the views of the witnesses on those issues. None of this can happen without funding. Can anyone put a figure on the funding being sought? Mr. Mongey referred to the cleaner, and I heard him speak about that earlier. I do not know how long a school with 1,000 students has had one cleaner. Covid-19 or no Covid-19, that does not seem tenable. Given the costs ultimately associated with all these documents and all the discussions that are happening, what kind of funding are we talking about? I ask Mr. Clerkin to answer those questions, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Clerkin and Mr. Mongey for their remarks. As long as that can-do attitude can remain, people will be a little bit more at ease with the whole process. I thank the witnesses.
