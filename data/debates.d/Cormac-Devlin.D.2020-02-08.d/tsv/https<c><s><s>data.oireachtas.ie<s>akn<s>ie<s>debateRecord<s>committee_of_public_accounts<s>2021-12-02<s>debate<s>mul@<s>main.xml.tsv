CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I confirm that I am on the campus. I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their attendance. It is good to engage with them again. I will touch on three topics: customs and excise; Brexit; and suspicious transaction reports. Starting with customs, Mr. Cody stated that there had been significant seizures of drugs and cigarettes in 2020 and 2021 and that Revenue was continuing its co-operation with the Garda and international organisations. Does he have a breakdown of the number of seizures of drugs and cigarettes across 2019 to 2021, be that at ports or elsewhere? I will ask a further question on this.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	He must be the only person who is happy to speak about Brexit. I believe Mr. Cody gave figures for cigarette seizures of €32.8 million and €40 million for 2020 and 2021, respectively. Does he have a breakdown of the drug seizures? I believe that the figures Mr. Cody provided only related to certain seizures. Were they the global figures for those years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If Mr. Cody does not have them to hand, that is fine because this is a specific matter. I just thought he might have them to hand. He might send on a note.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Harrahill. He might touch on significant seizures of other substances. He mentioned cocaine. The jump between the 2020 and 2021 figures is significant in light of the lockdown. While the world was looking at lockdowns, smugglers clearly were not. Instead, they were looking at opportunities. I commend the work of the customs agents and their sister agencies around the world in respect of these seizures. Are the majority of seizures at ports and airports or do they arise from follow-ups and raids? Mr. Harrahill mentioned equipment. The European Anti-Fraud Office of the European Commission gave a grant of €1.4 million and an X-ray scanning van was purchased. Was that in 2020 or 2019 and has that purchase resulted in a number of the seizures in question?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Harrahill for that. I am limited on time, but turning to the issue of Brexit-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	-----the EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, came into force on 1 January this year. Further changes in that regard will follow on 1 January 2022. What other engagement has Revenue had with SMEs? The last time Mr. Harrahill appeared before the committee, I commended him on the engagement that Revenue had undertaken with SMEs. Now that we are 12 months in, how are we engaging with SMEs and what are we doing in the context of the next tranche of proposed changes in January 2022?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Harrahill for that response. I might come back in later on with questions on the suspicious transactions reports, STRs.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will return to my previous line of questioning on Brexit. We were talking about the new changes coming in in January and the Revenue Commissioners' engagement with SMEs, which is very welcome, but I am wondering about the impact that Brexit has had overall on customs and excise duties and the collection of these since early 2021.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, I know.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The purpose of the question is to find out how much the Revenue Commissioners have spent on preparing for Brexit contingencies in terms of new systems. I am referring to what Mr. Cody was just about to ask Mr. Harrahill about.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there a cost associated with that? The delegates may send a breakdown to us in a note if they do not have it to hand. Could I have a rough estimate of the expenditure, between when Brexit came into our orbit and now, on ICT, the new staff, online preparation, forms, courses, and changes to the ports? Is there a rough estimate as to how much it has cost the Revenue Commissioners?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course.
