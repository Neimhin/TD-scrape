CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their time and input this afternoon. I have a question for Dr. Buquicchio. Earlier this year, at the beginning of the pandemic, how soon did the Italian Government respond with required regulations? We looked on in shock at the high rise in numbers across Italy. How soon were the regulations brought in and have they since been extended? Dr. Buquicchio earlier stated that some of regulations have expired but have some since been extended and if so, for how long?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Lord Sumption for his time. With regard to Dr. Buquicchio's point and in terms of Lord Sumption's earlier comments on the health or hysteria analysis of where we are and how the pandemic has been treated here or in any other jurisdiction, I agree with Dr. Buquicchio's point about reviewing and analysing the response of all national governments and, indeed, the international response to this pandemic. I turn to the earlier comments about the need for primary legislation to be in place to support those guidelines, or the secondary legislation that we are governed by in the current space.I note that the UK had the Coronavirus Act 2020 and the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 among others, to which to refer. In the context of a future pandemic similar to what we are experiencing today, what would need to happen to underpin the guidelines? Is the witness suggesting a brand new Act or legislation?  We touched on Brexit earlier and I presume Lord Sumption expected that it would be mentioned on this call. In the event of a future pandemic and in the context of travel, which was mentioned earlier, what impact will Brexit have on the UK in terms of its relationship with Europe and the wider world?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My thanks to all the witnesses for their opening remarks and statements. I will turn to Ms McNally first. She made a lengthy submission to the committee in advance of today and we appreciate that. In her opening remarks, she covered proportionality and necessity arising from the emergency. It is crucial that the balance is struck, especially now as we move away from the more stringent restrictions in society and try to reopen the court services. I have several questions for Ms McNally on this. Access to the courts, including the civil and criminal courts, is crucial. I wish to hone in on the criminal aspect first. Delays have not really been experienced because of the summer months and the lifting of the restrictions I have spoken about. Will Ms McNally give the committee a flavour of the range and types of cases we are talking about and the breadth of the cases that are being held up at present? What kind of delay are we talking about? Are we talking of a delay of eight or 12 months or longer? Obviously, it will be all approximate, but I would appreciate any comments. Ms McNally specifically referenced the Central Criminal Court. There were statements about the Circuit Criminal Court and the Central Criminal Court. I presume the same applies in respect of the Special Criminal Court. Will Ms McNally elaborate on that matter as well? Ms McNally referred to dates and said that the Circuit Court was returning in September - at some point this month. Has the date been released?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms McNamara for her intervention. I am sure our witnesses are familiar with the proposal from a few years ago to have all of the District Court sittings moved to the Criminal Courts of Justice building. Thankfully, that did not happen to the extent to which the Courts Service wanted it to happen because we would be in a totally different situation now. Ms O'Boyle touched on the remote court hearings and the success in that regard. We are all learning in this new era. Does Ms O'Boyle believe that remote hearings will remain post-Covid?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My thanks to the witnesses for their submissions, feedback and suggestions. I realise that it has been a long afternoon and many of the questions have been asked already, so bear with me while I seek some responses from the various witnesses. My first question is to all the witnesses. I have heard numerous references to other jurisdictions and praise for the manner either in which they brought in regulations or dealt with the pandemic initially. My question is to the witnesses individually. What jurisdictions would they highlight as good examples and what are the reasons for that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Ansbro for that information. Do any other witnesses wish to comment on that point? I would like to get to several other questions as well.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would be delighted if Ms McDonagh could forward that information.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In the earlier session we talked about a European co-operative model for the second wave, or indeed for another pandemic. If that were to happen, certainly there is learning to be had, not only by Ireland but other member states across Europe, to ensure there is a uniformity of approach. As the witness has said, there is already legislative cover there, and to be complicit with it is really important if we are to face a similar situation in the near or distant future. I refer to the particular submissions made by Ms McDonagh and Ms Gibney. In their introduction, they raised the gaps in the State's legislative framework. In particular, they highlighted legislation that is close to my own heart, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, and indeed also the Mental Health Act. Could they elaborate on that? The second element to which I refer is on page 2 of the witnesses' submission, namely, the adequacy of the State's legislative framework in its response to the pandemic. Could the witnesses broaden out on those two points for me?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I referred to the point made by the witnesses in page 2 of their submission about the adequacy of the State's legislative framework and its response to the pandemic. The submission sets out a number of bullet points in that regard. I ask Ms Gibney to expand on that. Before she comes back in, I want to turn to FLAC because I am conscious of my own time. I apologise for not having more time to discuss the various submissions. I remind Ms Barry and Mr. Bowes that the impact of the restriction on court sittings was discussed in a previous session of the committee earlier today. I compliment FLAC on the very substantial submission it made to the committee. It is greatly appreciated and there is a lot of information in it for all of us to digest. I ask the witnesses to comment on the impact that delays in court sittings and trials are going to have on their own work. While the clock is in my favour, I would like to put a question to Mr. Herrick and Ms Ansbro of the ICCL. They commented in a previous submission about the response being balance-necessary, and the resources being in place. If we were to face a second wave here in Ireland, how would the witnesses suggest that the State respond differently from the way it did, given the short period we may have between now and if that were to happen? If the witnesses would not mind answering, I would greatly appreciate it. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Barry for that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Gibney.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Herrick. If the various Oireachtas committees and subcommittees are up and running, oversight and scrutiny will be there, which is important. Hopefully, there will also be a unity among the various participants of those committees. I thank the witness for his answer.
