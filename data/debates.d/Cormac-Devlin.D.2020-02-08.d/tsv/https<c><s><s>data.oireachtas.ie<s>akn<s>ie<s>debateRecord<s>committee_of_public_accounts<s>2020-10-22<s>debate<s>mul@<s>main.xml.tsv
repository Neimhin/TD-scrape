CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee. In his opening statement, Mr. Watt referred to a three-year strategy that he hoped would be introduced and implemented shortly. He might let us know what particular areas that will focus on. He mentioned the OPW and properties in its charge, in particular those under the Department of Justice and Equality. What are the proposals for the Garda stations that recently closed?
