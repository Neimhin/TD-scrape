CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, for bringing this robust motion before us. As many speakers said, the interference with Ryanair flight FR4978 by the Belarusian regime on Sunday, 23 May, was extremely worrying and frightening, especially for those on board. This Ryanair flight was operating between two EU capital cities, Athens and Vilnius, and was carrying more than 170 passengers, including many EU citizens, and six crew, when it was forced to land in Minsk by the military forces of the Belarusian regime. What would have happened if the flight had not co-operated with those instructions? As we know, it was escorted in the air, which is extremely worrying. The illegal removal and detention of Roman Protasevich and his companion, Sofia Sapega, was a breach of all international norms and a gross violation of their human rights. This act of international piracy, committed by Alexander Lukashenko and his regime, was outrageous and cannot go unanswered. The brutality of the Lukashenko regime, now in its fifth term, is unprecedented and cannot be tolerated. The EU must respond firmly to this despicable crime and the ongoing repression and silencing of the opposition in Belarus. Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega must be released immediately. I will be continually asking through monthly parliamentary questions about their well-being until they are released. Sadly, every day, we continue to see the regular harassment and intimidation of Belarusian civil society, journalists and independent media, with unjust detentions and apparent attempts to criminalise human rights work. The repression of the Belarusian people, who are peacefully and courageously defending their democratic and human rights, is totally unacceptable. As we heard from my Fianna Fáil colleague, Deputy Haughey, the 2020 Belarusian election was rigged, with Lukashenko receiving less than 25% of the popular vote. Fianna Fáil rejects the democratic and moral legitimacy of the Lukashenko regime and supports the Belarusian people in their demand for new and free elections, under the supervision of independent observers. I welcome the European Council’s strong condemnation of the hijacking of the Ryanair flight and the detention of Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega. The move to restrict EU flights from Belarusian airspace is welcome, as are plans to increase economic and political sanctions on the leaders of the Lukashenko regime. I call on the Minister to raise the hijacking of Ryanair flight FR4978 and the other crimes of the Belarusian regime at the UN Security Council. There are currently 421 political prisoners in Belarus. I support the Government’s motion calling for the immediate release of Roman Protasevich, Sofia Sapega and all those unjustly detained in Belarus. It states that the Dáil rejects the democratic legitimacy of Alexander Lukashenko following the fraudulent 9 August 2020 elections, and that Ireland stands in solidarity with the Belarusian people in their peaceful defence of democratic principles and fundamental human rights.As we heard earlier, people are protesting peacefully outside the Dáil today, not only trying to raise the plight of Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega but of all those who have been impacted since the regime took hold. It is important, as we have heard unanimously across the House, that people stand in solidarity today. It underscores the seriousness of what took place a few days ago. It is really important that the Government is able to speak with one voice on behalf of the people of Ireland to articulate our concerns and that of our European counterparts that this should not and will not be tolerated and that we stand in solidarity with the Belarusian people. I hope this motion passes.
