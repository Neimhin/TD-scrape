CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome all of our witnesses. I will start with cybersecurity and the NCSC. Mr. Griffin said that the ambition was that 20 new staff would be recruited by the end of this year. Given that we are close to that point now, how successful has that been? What is the status of the recruitment programme?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is good that the Department is potentially ahead of where it wanted to be. Renovations were carried out on the interim facility being used for the centre. What was the extent of those renovations, what did they cost and why were they done on an interim facility when there was a plan to move to a new facility?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That lease can be renewed again and the property used for another-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Griffin have an idea of the costs to date? How much has been spent on those interim works?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is the newer building in Beggars Bush that the NCSC will move in to also owned by the OPW or is that leased?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, that is fine. If Mr. Griffin could provide a note on that, it would be much appreciated. I will now turn to the NBP, which we have discussed previously at the committee. I understand the deployment plan is 12 months behind schedule. Delving into that further, fines of €135,000 were issued in respect of build delays. I gather from what Mr. Griffin said in his opening statement, some of that is related to Covid-19 and other issues. A performance sanction of €22,500 was also issued. Performance reports for subsequent periods indicate that further sanctions may arise. Have the sanctions that were levied been paid? How many others have arisen since this report?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are they not revised targets?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are we not behind on the revised targets?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Just before Mr. Mulligan comes in I would like to ask another question because my time is limited. From 1 February to August of this year, sanctions totalling €134,800 were imposed but I understand there is a refundable option if other build milestones are achieved.I ask Mr. Mulligan to touch on this in his response.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	When does the refundable option kick in? How is it traded off against the milestones that are missed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Mulligan. With regard to blackspots, we focus a lot on rural Ireland but there are obviously blackspots in urban Ireland also. There are some glaring ones where there is fibre in the ground but houses cannot connect to it. I know the Department is aware of certain situations. I brought some to its attention. It is galling for people in an estate of 700 houses where it would seem financially lucrative for them to be able to connect but service providers are not willing to take up the mantle. This is a real problem for us. It goes beyond the national broadband plan because the fibre is there. How do we get around this problem?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Ó hÓbáin. The Department needs a carrot and stick approach with certain operators. While they have plans, the public have been waiting years for them to be able to connect to cabinets or whatever other infrastructure is required. In urban areas there is an expectation, and rightly so. Not being able to connect when fibre is right outside the house is illogical.
