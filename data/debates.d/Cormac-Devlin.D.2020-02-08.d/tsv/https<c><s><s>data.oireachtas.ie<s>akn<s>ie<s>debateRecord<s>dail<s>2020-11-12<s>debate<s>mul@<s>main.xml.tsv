CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for taking this question. Last year, passenger numbers rose in Dublin by 7.5%, going from 141 million passengers in 2018 to 151 million in 2019. I ask the Minister to provide an update on his plans to increase the bus fleet for 2021.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As I said, passenger numbers increased by 7.5% in Dublin and 138 million journeys took place on Dublin Bus services in 2019. Dublin Bus has significantly increased efficiency, brought in new timetables and improved frequencies on the network, which has enabled it to continue growing its passenger numbers, hopefully into 2021. It is clear that there is a demand for improved and increased services across Dublin and Dubliners want to see more improvements on public transport. That is only right. If we want people to leave their cars at home, we are going to have to improve public transport services. I note what the Minister said about the BusConnects plans. That project is important and while the majority of it is welcome, some new routes will also benefit the network. On new proposed routes, I note that there was a discussion around 24-hour bus services. If the Minister has any information on that, particularly routes southbound from Dublin city to Bray, I ask him to elaborate on it.
