CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Coyle is very welcome. I am sorry I was delayed for the opening remarks. I note Mr. Coyle mentioned the Maritime Area Planning Act in his opening statement. I am from a coastal community in DÃºn Laoghaire-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	-----and obviously there is a lot of opportunity on the east coast. The east coast is the priority area for offshore wind. Given the events in Ukraine and the need for our energy independence, how does Mr. Coyle foresee the development application and subsequent permission for wind farms on the east coast? I apologise if Mr. Coyle has gone over this ground already, but I am interested to hear his thoughts on it. Our need for our own wind energy and how to utilise that have come into sharp focus now.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Coyle mentioned the floating apparatus in Scotland and Wales. That has been mooted here. The technology has evolved over the last couple of years and, as Mr. Coyle correctly pointed out, the large-scale investment in this industry is coming on stream and improving all the time. Mr. Coyle also mentioned the shallowness of Dublin Bay and, I presume, the attractiveness of that section of the east coast.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The floating wind farms are slightly different in the sense that the visual amenity is always going to be an issue. We saw it in Arklow and anywhere that offshore energy has been mooted. For the Dublin area, the proximity to the coastline is the biggest issue. If it is too close to the shore, people will object.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It has to be towards the horizon.
