CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Deputy MacSharry asked me to pass on his apologies to the committee today. I thank Dr. Sweeney for his presentation. Much research has gone into it and it is welcome. How many existing tenancies remain under the rent supplement scheme? From my experience RAS was better than the rent supplement scheme. HAP was also better than RAS. There are flaws and there is an over-reliance on each of those schemes. With rent supplement, I was aware of some tenancies falling into arrears for various reasons at the time. Does Dr. Sweeney have a breakdown of the number of tenancies that fell into arrears which were in receipt of rent supplement?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Dr. Sweeney have figures from his research for the number of landlords who have exited RAS since its inception and to the point when it will be phased out?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I compliment Dr. Sweeney again on his presentation. For the committee, the figures are quite startling and the money spent is enormous. Does he have a figure for the number of people who availed of each of the schemes broken down by local authority across the country? Does he have a breakdown of the cost of running those schemes versus the cost of construction during a similar period?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for cutting across but my time is limited. I presume that is because of that top-up that so many people have to avail of in the Dublin region, given the price of properties. Does Dr. Sweeney have any data on the numbers availing of the top-up to avail of rent support in the Dublin region or in other major population centres?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know I was asking Dr. Sweeney for additional information. It would be greatly appreciated if he could furnish the committee with any other information he might have. I thank him for appearing before us today.
