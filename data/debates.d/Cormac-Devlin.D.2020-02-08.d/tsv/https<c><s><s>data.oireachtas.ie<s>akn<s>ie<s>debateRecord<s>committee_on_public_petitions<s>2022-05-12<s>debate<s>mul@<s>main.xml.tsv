CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Walsh. I thank him for his attendance, his contribution and his original petition. He has highlighted various elements. He has a great knowledge of and interest in this. As Deputy Buckley said, the legislation is already here. It needs to be implemented and enforced where necessary. I was particularly pleased to hear Mr. Walsh mention my county council, in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which took this step a number of years ago. There was hesitation about it. Mr. Walsh mentioned the weeds and so on that he saw on his route through Dublin to Leinster House. There is a knock-on effect. Some pesticides and herbicides do what they say on the tin, but there are unseen impacts on the environment. That is why Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown took what was, to my knowledge, a unanimous decision, and other local authorities acted too. Mr. Walsh mentioned his own county. I was reading the guidelines and one matter stuck out. The officers of the pesticide control division in the Department will inspect local authorities for compliance with the sustainable usage of pesticides directive, SUD. Does Mr. Walsh have much information from the Department about how many inspections of local authorities have been conducted? Colleagues have mentioned restrictions in sensitive areas. Mr. Walsh mentioned playgrounds. Where these are used can be seen, because there is a scorched earth look to grass, to verges or to wherever it is used. Public representatives get many calls when weeds are not under control. Mr. Walsh mentioned hot foam and other methods. All of those should be used. They are better for the environment. Some Irish companies produce the chemical-free agents that local authorities could use. One in my area, VivaGreen, has many non-chemical, non-invasive products which work. Is Mr. Walsh aware of other, preferably Irish, companies that are doing that too? Mr. Walsh might answer those, then I will come back in if possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The first question is on the use of the-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	By the Department.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Public representatives and members of the public want to see weeds controlled where possible. They do not want the place to look untidy. To use Mr. Walsh's analogy, people are not looking for golf course quality, but ultimately, they do not want the place to fall into wrack and ruin. A balance is to be struck. Where local authorities could use products that are not harmful to the environment, humans or animals, we need to make sure that they do so. Alternative methods such as hot foam are fine, but we also need to encourage local authorities to explore other options. I am not necessarily hearing that from Mr. Walsh.Maybe to follow from today, the committee could write to the Department and find out first how many inspections have been happening. I heard what was said about Cork but I am suspicious that it is because of Mr. Walsh's activity that Cork was inspected last year. We need to find out how many inspections are done annually and also what kind of promotion and experiments are being done with non-chemically based products. We should find this out from the Department and then maybe we could engage with Mr. Walsh and others in a little while again. I thank the witness again for his attendance and answering the queries. Well done.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am reminding myself of the response from the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Brendan Gleeson. It touches on what we talked about earlier. He speaks about pesticide use in public areas and the current situation. I note that he states that if a product authorised for professional use is intended to be used, it can be applied only by a Department-registered professional user. Going back to the non-chemical products, Mr. Walsh might be able to assist in that regard because of his experience. Senator Murphy is correct that Mr. Walsh obviously has a real grá for and an interest in the topic. It would be good to identify a number of non-chemical products that could be recommended to the Department. Ultimately, if the Department takes the lead on this, the local authorities will follow. The Department goes on to state in its response that there is best practice in responsible pesticide use in public areas. That is a guidance document the Department produces. That is one point. The second point is that the reply goes on to state that there is currently a robust EU legal framework for placing on the market the use of pesticides and that the EU is responding to the concerns of member states in a more harmonised approach to deliver fully on the ambitions of sustainable use of pesticides. In tandem with what the Department is doing, the committee, on foot of Mr. Walsh's petition, should correspond with the Department, not only about the inspections but also about whether it is trialling non-chemical products and whether it recommends them on its list for professional contractors. That might also assist because it is in line with Mr. Walsh's recommendations to the committee. One point is about the warning signs, and that is fine. Maybe an information campaign could be good, particularly around April and May every year, as the growing season comes on. Mr. Walsh said all city and county councils should adopt the same policy. I agree with him on that. He is right that if it works in one area, it should work in them all. The problem, however, going back to the Chairman's point, is manpower. We can have all the machines we want but we need people to drive them regularly. Mr. Walsh's experience in Holland is fine if they have the crews to go out regularly, but we find there are long stretches of road that do not get the attention they need and people give out about them. As I said earlier, there is a balance to be struck here. We have to be cognisant of biodiversity as well. We cannot kill everything that is growing that we do not like the look of. That is not good either. To Mr. Walsh's third point about the non-chemical alternatives, that is where he can assist, as well as the committee corresponding with the Department, to try to recommend more non-chemical-based products. Let us see whether the Department is trialling them - we do not know - and how many inspections are being undertaken. Then, when we get the response, we might engage again with Mr. Walsh.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Walsh mentioned the Straight A’s for AMENITY booklet, which is a fair question, perhaps, to add to our letter as well. This letter to the Department is getting longer by the minute, but in fairness some of the things Mr. Walsh touched on today were not responded to or highlighted within the Department's response. Obviously, they were not highlighted in Mr. Walsh's original petition. This is coming out in our discussion, which is helpful. It would be good to know when the booklet was actually produced, however. It does not reference section 12 of SI 155 of 2012, which Mr. Walsh mentioned. It would be useful if we could establish that. Mr. Walsh is right in saying that if the booklet were updated, if it has not been already, then that could do some of the work we are actually talking about and people would be informed about what they should and should not do. Ultimately, the vast majority of people want to comply. Mr. Walsh mentioned the product. I have had experience of this in the past while. The vast majority of people are looking for non-invasive chemicals to use. They do not want to do any harm. That is where we need to make sure the Department is trialling those. If we can get those responses from the Department in that correspondence, that will help and it might inform our discussion.
