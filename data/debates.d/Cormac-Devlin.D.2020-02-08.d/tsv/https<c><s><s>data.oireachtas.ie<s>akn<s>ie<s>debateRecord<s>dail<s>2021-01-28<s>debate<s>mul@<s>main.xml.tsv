CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for sharing time and for his statement. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the roll-out of our Covid-19 vaccination programme. I thank the Minister and his ministerial colleagues in the Department of Health for all their efforts during this global pandemic. Equally, I acknowledge the tragic deaths of 3,120 people and offer my deep condolences to all those who have lost loved ones during this pandemic. Like everyone in Ireland, I am extremely grateful for the efforts of our front-line healthcare staff who have worked tirelessly and diligently to keep people safe over the past year. Just yesterday, we saw 1,335 new cases of Covid-19 confirmed, 437 of which were here in Dublin. While this represents a considerable reduction on the peak of more than 8,000 cases three weeks ago, it is still very challenging and worrying for society as a whole. Almost 1,670 people are currently in hospital, with the HSE reporting that 217 are in ICU. While our seven-day average of cases has fallen from a high of 1,322 to 249 per 100,000 people it is clear that Covid-19 continues to pose a serious danger and threat to people. Sadly, more people will die but the public health message is very clear and straightforward: stay home and stay safe. There is light at the end of the tunnel and, as we heard from the Minister, there is hope. The vaccine programme is being rolled out widely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is correct; the time is allocated by grouping. I was just saying that there is light at the end of the tunnel and there is hope with the vaccination programme well under way. As the Minister noted in his remarks, more than 143,000 vaccinations were administered up to last weekend, with another 51,000 due to be administered by this weekend. This will constitute the vast majority of nursing home residents and front-line healthcare staff. News that people over 70 years of age will start to receive their inoculations in the next two weeks is very encouraging. During the first wave, this cohort was particularly vulnerable and the worst impacted. Many such people have been cocooning or restricting their movements. News that the vaccination programme is well under way will come as a great relief to them. There is a great enthusiasm for the vaccinations. Like all of my colleagues in the House, I have been contacted by constituents looking for more information on the vaccine programme. People want to know when they are likely to be vaccinated and what the arrangements will be. The Minister has highlighted the arrangement made with GPs and pharmacists. This is very welcome. I am sure there will be further news in that regard. There is a real hunger for information among the public. Of course, all of this is subject to supply and, as the Minister highlighted in his remarks, there are issues in that regard at times and supply can fluctuate but people want a rough indication of when they will receive vaccination. I ask the Minister to ask the HSE about sending information to all homes or about a robust information campaign which might include a website and a helpline which people could ring to ask questions and get the information they desire about the vaccinations. I thank the Minister and his officials and all of the vaccination teams for the great work they are doing as part of this national effort.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to analyse and discuss the Government's housing policy, particularly in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had a terrible impact on our society and economy, with more than 3,120 people dying and many more seriously ill. This has put huge pressure on our front-line healthcare workers. Rightly, the Government has moved to suppress the virus, a strategy that will continue as the vaccines are rolled out. While necessary, it is expected that the Covid restrictions will have an impact on overall housing supply in 2021. I welcome the fact that the Minister has kept social housing projects open and that regulations on other essential sites will be published later today. It is critical we continue building these badly needed homes and essential projects. Covid indicators are showing an improvement and hopefully it will be possible for the construction sector to restart when the situation is next reviewed.  Unlike many on the Opposition benches who offer no realistic solutions, the Minister has taken concrete steps to help families at risk of homelessness. New rental legislation introduced over the past six months provides greater protection for renters and families. The ban on evictions has been strengthened and extended and record funding has been provided to bring vacant homes back into use. The target is 1,189 in Dublin alone and 3,620 nationally. I welcome this and ask the Minister to ensure that this work continues into 2022. The results of all of this are clear. Homeless figures have fallen by 18.8% over the past year, meaning that over 2,000 families were supported out of homelessness. While the numbers of homeless people are still far too high, the progress to date should be acknowledged and must continue. Many Irish people want to own their own home and I welcome the supports given to first-time buyers, particularly through the help-to-buy scheme, which assisted 21,000 people to get on the property ladder. I would welcome other supports that provide affordable homes and also an expansion of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme. In my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire, we are seeing a phenomenal amount of housing construction, especially along the Luas green line corridor. The housing stock in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is projected to grow at almost four times the national average over the next ten years. The proposed LDA development of almost 600 social and affordable on lands in Shanganagh will provide much-needed housing locally. I ask the Minister to continue to liaise with his colleagues, particularly the Ministers for Transport and for Public Expenditure and Reform, to ensure public transport and green infrastructure projects are developed in tandem with new housing developments.  I welcome the publication of the general scheme of the affordable housing Bill. There is great interest in an affordable housing scheme. Unfortunately some on the Opposition benches dismissed the Bill out of hand before they had even seen it but as they have always opposed affordable housing schemes, this is no great surprise. I look forward to examining the Bill in detail as it proceeds through the Oireachtas. I wish to acknowledge the work the Minister, his officials and local authority staff have done over the past year. As we begin to exit from the Covid restrictions in the coming months, I ask that a greater degree of urgency be attached to development.
