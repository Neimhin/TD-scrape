CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Ms Simson and thank for her remarks, particularly as regards the REPower EU plan. Obviously, the emphasis of the plan has changed, given the geopolitical events Europe is facing. I am particularly struck by the need to protect and support Ukraine, Moldova and the Baltic states. I had the opportunity to visit Lithuania recently. I saw what it did long before the Russian aggression in Ukraine began. It kind of had a prelude to the use of energy as a weapon. We have now come to see that right across Europe. Ireland is facing a skills shortage, as is the whole of Europe. Ms Simson mentioned that issue, which I welcome. Although it is not specifically under her remit, it has a direct impact on that remit. I ask her to address how Europe will provide, support and attract those necessary skills. We can do nothing without them. All the great plans cannot be dealt with if we do not have those skills. Ms Simson touched on solar. She is welcome to Dublin. I assure her that the sun shines here the odd time and we will be able to use solar power. Europe as a larger entity has great plans in that regard. I ask Ms Simson to expand on that issue in the context of the EU solar strategy specifically. As Ms Simson rightly pointed out, the committee and the State have been working in recent years to improve our credentials in terms of better energy security for the island and, ultimately, as the Chair stated, seeking to export in order to help support colleagues across the EU. I again thank Ms Simson. It is great to have her here with us.
