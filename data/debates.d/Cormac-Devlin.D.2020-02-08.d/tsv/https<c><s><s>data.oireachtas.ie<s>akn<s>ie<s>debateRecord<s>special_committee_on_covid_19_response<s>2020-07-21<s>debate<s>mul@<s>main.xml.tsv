CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Acting Chair. I thank the witnesses for their attendance and particularly Ms Murphy for her personal account. Like the public at large, we appreciate all that the witnesses and their members do daily, particularly during this crisis. There were a lot of challenges in advance of Covid and especially during Covid and the witnesses' submissions articulated that very well. The million-dollar question, particularly if a second wave - God forbid - were to come, is what could we do differently and how could we do it. I would be interested to hear from the various organisations here. Perhaps the representatives of the INMO would like to answer. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Ní Sheaghdha. Does any other organisation have recommendations on how we might do things differently?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	SIPTU's submission caused a bit of a flurry in advance of this meeting. It was about certain workers presenting for work with potential symptoms in fear of losing overtime or premiums. I find that worrying and I am sure members of the public would as well. How widespread was that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Obviously if there is a second wave, we need to be very conscious of that. From my perspective, the message should be that anybody who shows symptoms, irrespective of monetary gain, should not present for work. I hope Mr. King, the other witnesses and all members share that view. While financial considerations are a legitimate concern, surely health would override those. I wish Mr. King good luck in SIPTU's discussions with the HSE. On the discussions between the organisations the witnesses represent and the HSE, I presume they are ongoing in the face of a second wave. Will the witnesses elaborate on that issue?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for being here today and answering our questions. I only have five minutes and I will be brief. I hope the responses will also be accurate and brief. Deputy McAuliffe referred to the testing available to healthcare workers. I am conscious that we need to be prepared for a second wave if it comes. I refer to the supply chain for PPE, in particular the roll-out in the early stages of the first phase of the pandemic to public hospitals and private settings.What assurances can the witnesses give that sufficient stock exists and that PPE will be rolled out to the various community and public health settings?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Woods for that. It brings me to my next point, which is the potential loss of step-down and convalescent services that will be acutely needed, particularly in the winter months. These types of services are needed and it is essential that we do not lose them. We need them in order that patients can leave acute hospital settings and convalesce elsewhere. From a public health point of view, having an alternative venue for people to quarantine or have respite is desirable. What interactions does the HSE currently have in respect of securing and maintaining those services? We heard about the funded workforce plan from union representatives during our first session today. I understand that is currently being discussed. What information can our guests give us about that matter?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Woods mean the question I asked about convalescence?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I represent the Dún Laoghaire constituency and there are a number of such settings. Caritas Convalescent Centre, in particular, was in the newspapers last week. While it is a private setting and decisions are made independently of the HSE, it would remiss of the State not to have access to those facilities. We must ensure that no other closures will happen because we will need those settings in the next few months.
