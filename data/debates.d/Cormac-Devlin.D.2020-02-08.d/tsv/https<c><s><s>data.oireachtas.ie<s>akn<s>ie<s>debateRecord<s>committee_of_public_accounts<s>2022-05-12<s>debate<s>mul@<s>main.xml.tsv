CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I share the Chair's frustration. I am very pleased to hear the willingness of Professor Mey and the chancellor to publish the report. It is certainly some comfort to the committee. They can appreciate our insistence that we see it. When it is published, I imagine that we will be inviting them back to discuss it in more detail. I hope it is not a barrier to our discussion this morning. There is a lot to discuss and I have a limited amount of time. I welcome our witnesses. The big thing I would like to discuss at the outset is the city centre campus. Primarily I would like to afford time to the witnesses to take us through from April 2019 until today. I heard them speak about the investment in the site and their excitement for the university about this site. This cannot overlook the enormous cost of the site and the increased cost of the site from €3 million originally when it was valued by Limerick City and County Council to what was paid for it at more than €8 million. Will the witnesses take us through the reason for the increase in costs?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The KPMG report covers the information given to the governing authority and the subsequent process the university undertook to acquire the site.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would Professor Mey like to come in on that aspect?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Butler for that. The Opera site has not been mentioned yet. I ask the witnesses to talk about that site and when it was evaluated vis-à-vis the Dunnes site coming back into play which, Ms Harney said, was in 2019. Was the Opera site being considered prior to that? How advanced was that and was there expenditure made against the Opera site?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the Department's view of the expenditure that has been made? I note that the level of income from State grants has increased from 2014 through to 2020. Obviously there are questions about the pausing of some of those grants, which I might get to if I have time, but on the acquisition of this site, would the Department care to comment?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would the Department not have a view on the process undertaken, given the fact that it is State money and given how the site was acquired?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does the pausing impact last year's funding as well as this year's funding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The procurement non-compliance is in the region of €400,000. I also noted something strange in the accounts. The internal audit was outsourced up until 2019. Was that an historical decision? Was that always the case or was that something that was done over the past decade? Was it the same company or organisation that was conducting the internal audit for the university? Who was that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was the company that was undertaking the internal audit in place for a long period or was it changed every couple of years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask that the university would send us a note on that because that raises questions for me. It is most peculiar to have an outside organisation doing an internal audit and it is certainly the right step that the university has taken in that regard. Speaking of steps being taken, I note that total legal expenditure is €926,000, which is actually lower than the figure for 2019. I presume this year's figure might be higher, given what we discussed earlier. There is a brand refresh and implementation fund of €87,000, which is higher than the 2019 figure, which was €85,000. The university in its opening statement highlighted the impact this whole saga has had on the reputation of the university. Is that fund for repairing some of the damage?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The university has a public relations fund of €33,000 as well as a separate fund for what Professor Mey has called a brand refresh. If the fund was for the implementation of the strategic plan that would be fine but it is specifically referenced as a brand refresh, which stood out for me.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, does Professor Mey wish to comment on the legal expenditure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, a sum of €926,000 is marked for last year and €1.04 million for 2019.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I might come in again later, if there is time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will stay with the issue of the deposit on the house in Dublin. Corrective action was taken, which is good. Has there been an investigation to see if any other properties were bid for, purchased, had deposits paid for or anything else that is outside the scope of Limerick city and its environs?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	For a while there I was thinking it was more like a property management agency than a university. I want to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General a question and I will return to that non-compliance amount of €407,583. What did that relate to and what corrective actions can he see that have been taken on the issue of non-compliance?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to protected disclosures, which there have been a few of. To ensure there is a confidence within the university to bring forward disclosures, what remedies or improvements has UL made to ensure there is protection for those individuals who feel they have information to come forward in the university?
