Before we go to the Minister of State, I welcome the boys and girls from the primary school in the Gallery this morning. They are all very welcome to the House. There were a number of chuckles during the Deputy's contribution so I think there is agreement up there in the Gallery. I call the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.
