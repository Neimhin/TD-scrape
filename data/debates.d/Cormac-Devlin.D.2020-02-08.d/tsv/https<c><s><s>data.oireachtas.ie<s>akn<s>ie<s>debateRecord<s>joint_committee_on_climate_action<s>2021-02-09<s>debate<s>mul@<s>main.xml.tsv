CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for being delayed. I was at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, which I am sure Mr. O'Rourke is glad he was not at. That will be for another day. I congratulate Mr. O'Rourke on his appointment. It is lovely to have him here. I have read his opening statement. On the decarbonisation of the sector and the ESB's contribution to it, I commend Mr. O'Rourke. I heard a presentation from his public affairs section some weeks ago and it was very informative. What supports has the ESB given over the past year to both residential and business customers in the face of the pandemic? While that is slightly off topic, I would like an answer since Mr. O'Rourke is here. On the ESB's Brighter Future strategy, I am aware from Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, from which I hail, that the council has worked closely with the electricity suppliers to change sodium lights to LED lights. Is Mr. O'Rourke familiar with this? Will he enlighten the committee — excuse the pun — on how many public lanterns have been changed across the country? Mr. O'Rourke said 240,000 new meters are being installed across the country, resulting in efficiencies. He might delve into this a little. With regard to energy security overall, I would be interested in hearing Mr. O'Rourke's thoughts on Ireland's energy security in the face of Brexit and the impact it may have on energy efficiency in Ireland. I join Senator Higgins in commenting on No. 29 Fitzwilliam Street. I welcome Mr. O'Rourke's comments on righting the wrongs of the 1960s and the destruction of the terrace, but there should be scope within the redeveloped complex to house a museum.He said the ESB is working with Dublin City Council, which I welcome. There should be some museum after the works are completed. It is imperative. He also said his own children saw the museum. As a child, I went to see it. Anybody in an educational facility, particularly in the east, will have gone to see it. It was a wonderful asset and I do not want to see it lost to the city.
