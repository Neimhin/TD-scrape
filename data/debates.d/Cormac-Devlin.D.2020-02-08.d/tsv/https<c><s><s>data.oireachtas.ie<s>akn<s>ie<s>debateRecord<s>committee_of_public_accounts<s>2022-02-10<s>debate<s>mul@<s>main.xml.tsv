CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses. I apologise for being delayed. If I repeat some questions, I hope I will be forgiven because I did not hear them all. I listened to the opening statements and a few things struck me. To allude to something the Cathaoirleach was just saying, at the outset of this there was much criticism and much debate as to whether the State should get involved in this at all when the private sector was not. That was clear. There needed to be some sort of mechanism to roll out broadband, particularly for rural Ireland. I will get to urban heartlands shortly. If this had not been done, where would we be now in the absence of this framework? I know it is hard to ponder that but, realistically, where would be if this was not in place?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We all saw and experienced that during the lockdowns. We saw the need for connectivity of all different types, including multiple connections per home as children were doing school activities while we were all trying to work remotely. We even took part in this committee remotely, albeit from within these buildings. On what date is the 25-year contract due to expire? What was the start date and when is the end date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is NBI to continue to manage that for those ten years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	To turn to the opening statement, Mr. Hendrick said 475 BCPs, including some in schools, have been installed. That is obviously very welcome. He also said that 54,500 premises are currently able to place an order via their preferred retail service provider. Are the 475 points included in that 54,500 premises?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are those 54,500 new connections resulting from the work that started in January 2020?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I see. That leads me onto the 154,000 premises constructed or under construction. These are also as a result of-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, that is fine. Mr. Hendrick also referred to 1,200 people hired. How many of those are direct employees of NBI?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course, there is always a spin-off. NBI employs 300 and then there are the contractors Mr. Hendrick mentioned. He also referred to subcontractors and listed off a good few of them. Is he saying the remaining 900 are contractors?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does that include subcontractors?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	All right. I just wanted to get a rough total of the number working on it. In his statement, Mr. Hendrick also mentioned NBI's co-operation and work with Eir and Enet. I commend him on his work for the islands. That is important. We are talking about rural Ireland and you cannot get much more remote than the islands. That work is essential because it will have benefits in terms of people returning to the islands and repopulating them and in sustaining communities. That is very welcome. However, there are also black spots in urban areas. Colleagues from across the House will know of black spots in towns, villages and cities in the areas they represent. There are several in my own area. I am not seeing the sense of urgency Mr. Hendrick has spoken about with regard to connections in those area. How are those issues going to be resolved? It seems that dealing with issues in urban areas would be simpler given that the services are practically outside people's doors. These providers, Eir, Enet and others, give commitments to connect these premises but it never happens. We are talking about years, long before 2020. People are losing faith. Ultimately, that is the engine of the economy. We need to ensure that there is good connectivity across cities and counties. What is going to happen there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We receive a lot of complaints about the lack of connectivity or high-speed broadband. How do we liaise with NBI to highlight those black spots? As I have said, there are plenty of them.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. Hendrick come back to us with information on the programme for those particular types of premises? That is probably the bigger issue. As a representative of an urban area, the existence of black spots is a big issue. I hope that NBI is aware of them all but, in case it is not, there needs to be a way for Members to feed in for various different reasons. I am talking about the construction of new homes and certain streets that seem to have been bypassed for the high-speed fibre roll-out. We need a way to inform NBI to ensure these are included in a work programme and that the works are ultimately done. I am still not quite clear on the timelines. I acknowledge that the timeline for each will be different because they are so sporadic but it is a matter of how they are going to be addressed and ensuring they are addressed. Mr. Hendrick said these premises may be done earlier than the projected date. I hope that is the case.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Hendrick for the clarity.
