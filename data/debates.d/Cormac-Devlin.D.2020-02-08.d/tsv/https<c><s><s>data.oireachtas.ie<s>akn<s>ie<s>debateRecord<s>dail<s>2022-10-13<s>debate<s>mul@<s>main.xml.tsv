CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Staying with the topic of Irish Water, is the Tánaiste aware of the earthy-smelling and poor-tasting water that is being supplied to homes and business in the south Dublin-north Wicklow area? I understand that complaints relate to supplies from the Vartry water supply plant, which serves customers in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Dublin city and north Wicklow. Irish Water has assured the public that the water supply is safe and properly treated. It says the smell is harmless, however, and it is investigating the issue. I ask the Tánaiste - I am not assuming he has a note on this matter today - to furnish the results of that investigation and discuss it with the Minister concerned.
