CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the representatives of the OGP for their time. My first question relates to the long-running interpretation and translation services case. I appreciate that it was successfully defended in the High Court and I am not going to go into the merits and the detail of the case. I know the OGP cannot either because I understand it is being judicially reviewed. I am not sure if that has concluded. However, does Mr. Quinn have an estimated cost for that long-running process at this point, given I understand the final decision was made in May 2019? Also, how has that particular case changed the procurement rules for the Office of Government Procurement?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good, I thank Mr. Quinn. My second question is on the non-competitive procurement and, as the Comptroller and Auditor General and members will be aware, in recent months we have had a number of bodies and Departments come before the committee where it has been noted in the accounts that there have been contracts that have been extended or rolled over. I am aware that this can be for various reasons but I seek the OGP's perspective on ensuring that people are complying with procurement rules. In some cases those roll-overs and extensions last several years. Therefore, from the OGP's point of view, how is that dealt with, how is it prevented from happening and how do we ensure the public purse is getting value for money?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept the OGP is not policing that particular rule but how often would the office reiterate that, particularly in light of Covid-19? As we exit the pandemic period, I presume we are going to see quite a few extensions and roll-overs over the next couple of years in separate accounts. In order to ensure there is a competitive process, and as I say-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	-----value for money is secured for the public purse, how often does the office reiterate that need to put contracts out to tender?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Should I take it that the OGP issues regular reminders to people just to ensure that those Accounting Officers are adhering to the rules? I know it cannot follow up if they are, but does the office issue reminders on that basis?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman for letting me back in. On the issue of the contracts that have been extended, or roll-over contracts, do the witnesses have an idea of the number we are talking about annually? I note from the report that there are several of those lasting several years.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Having reviewed them for 2019, does Mr. Quinn have an idea, even off the top of his head, of the number we are talking about? Are we talking about 100, 300 or more?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Quinn might come back to me on it, if he does not mind.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Quinn. That would be helpful because it has come up time and again with various bodies and Departments. I understand some of them are necessary but with regard to others it is a bone of contention, particularly for suppliers who, when they see something up on eTenders and they are not successful, find that something has not even been tendered. It is important for me and, presumably, the witnesses, that we see that good processes are followed to ensure that there is a competitive nature in all tenders.
