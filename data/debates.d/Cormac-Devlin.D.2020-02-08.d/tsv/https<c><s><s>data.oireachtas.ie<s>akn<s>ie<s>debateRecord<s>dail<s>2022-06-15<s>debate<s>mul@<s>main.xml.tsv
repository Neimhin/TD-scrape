CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I ask the House to note that the amendments to the motion regarding energy security are displaying incorrectly on the DÃ¡il website. The Regional Group's amendment to the Government amendment is displaying in two places as an amendment to the Government amendment and also as amendment No. 2 to the motion. It should be only displaying as an amendment to the Government amendment. The People Before Profit-Solidarity amendment, which should be displaying as amendment No. 2 to the motion, is displaying as amendment No. 3. With that in mind, I call Deputy Michael Collins, who will be followed by Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Nolan.
