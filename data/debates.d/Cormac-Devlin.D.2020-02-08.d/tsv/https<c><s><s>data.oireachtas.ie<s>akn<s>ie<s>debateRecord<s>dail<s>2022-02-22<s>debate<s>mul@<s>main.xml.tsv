CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for that update. The census is due to be conducted on Sunday, 3 April. Can he provide us with an update on its preparation? The census will provide a snapshot of post-Covid Ireland at the start of the 21st century. If arrangements have not been finalised, I ask the Minister of State to consider introducing indicators and questions in respect of the impact of climate change and biodiversity. Perhaps questions regarding the use of pay-as-you-go meters could be obtained as it is a strong indication of financial strain on households. While we are discussing census 2022, I ask the Minister of State to consider accelerating the publication of the 1926 census. This is an issue I have raised previously in the Chamber. It has the potential to drive an interest in Ireland from diaspora. I take this opportunity to thank the visitors from the US who are in the Public Gallery today. The early publication of the 1926 census could be a boost for Irish tourism.
