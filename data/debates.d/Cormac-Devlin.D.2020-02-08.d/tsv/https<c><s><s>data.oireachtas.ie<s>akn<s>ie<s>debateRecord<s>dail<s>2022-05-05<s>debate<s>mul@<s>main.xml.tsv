CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Government’s efforts to support people fleeing Russia's war in Ukraine. According to the UNHCR, more than 5.5 million people have been forced to flee Ukraine since the Russian invasion on 24 February. As of yesterday, 27,372 people have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine. A total of 18,661 people have sought accommodation through the international protection accommodation service scheme. I welcome confirmation from the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth that they have been offered safe emergency accommodation while long-term arrangements are being finalised. I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Brien. I also thank his colleagues, the Ministers with responsibility for children, education and justice and other Departments and agencies for their efforts to date. I know staff have made a tremendous effort over the past few weeks to deal with this unprecedented challenge. I also commend local authority staff on their efforts. In Dún Laoghaire Rathdown we have seen fantastic initiatives and efforts made in recent weeks. As have other speakers, I highlight the tremendous welcome provided by the Irish people to people fleeing their homes in Ukraine and the efforts of local volunteers who have stepped up to support Ukrainians in towns and villages throughout Ireland. Given the extent of the situation, the State has done well to date, but there are longer-term issues. One can foresee pressures and challenges and the Minister might consider a number of suggestions. I have spoken to people who have offered homes or are considering offering homes, particularly on a more long-term basis. They feel guidance or standard arrangements for essentials such as insurance and terms of licences would be helpful. A modest payment to families hosting people to cover underlying costs might also be helpful. A modest grant, linked with appropriate terms and conditions, to bring housing stock up to standard might be a quick way to unlock long-term vacant stock. The Minister is examining this. Having visited Lithuania in March I am well aware of the feeling in the EU, particularly in the Baltic states which are subject to ongoing hostility and threats from Russia. Europe must continue to stand united against Russian aggression and sanctions must continue until Russia ends its war and occupation in Ukraine. In the meantime, Ireland must do everything we can to support the people of Ukraine. As noted by their ambassador to Ireland, H.E., Gerasko Larysa, Ukraine and its people are fighting for their existence in Russia's barbaric illegal war.
