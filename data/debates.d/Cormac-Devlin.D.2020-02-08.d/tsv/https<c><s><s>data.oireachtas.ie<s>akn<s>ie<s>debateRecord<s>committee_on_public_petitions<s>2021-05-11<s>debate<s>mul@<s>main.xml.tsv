CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Thank you very much. I thank Mr. Tyndall, Mr. Garvey and Ms Joyce for their attendance today. I compliment Mr. Tyndall's on the update produced in March. It was very comprehensive and extremely informative, considering the committee's concerns. I was on the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response last year. Mr. Tyndall appeared before the committee and discussed many of the issues surrounding the residents in direct provision centres and their concerns in the face of the pandemic. It is evident from the Ombudsman's report today that there are ongoing complaints of different nature. What was the No. 1 complaint received by the office over the past few years, pandemic aside? Chapter 2 of the update raises issues such as driver licences, bank accounts and complaints about various Departments. Will Mr. Tyndall elaborate on the extent of those problems and why they exist? Mr. Tyndall said there were 61 complaints in 2020, down 60% from 168 in 2019. I heard what Mr. Tyndall said about being physically present. He highlighted signage and advanced notice being given in various languages, Arabic, French, Russian, etc., which is welcome. Will Mr. Tyndall give a broad outline of the number of and the biggest complaints and how they can be resolved?
