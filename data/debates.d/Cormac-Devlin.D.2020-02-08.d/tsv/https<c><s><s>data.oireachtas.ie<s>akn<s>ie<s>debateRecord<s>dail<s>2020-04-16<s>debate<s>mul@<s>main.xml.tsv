CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My question concerns the Covid-19 emergency unemployment payment. I have been contacted, as I am sure other Deputies have, by people who are over the age of 66 and are either employed or self-employed. Many of these people have faced financial hardship and they are not entitled to that payment. I am wondering if the Minister has costed that payment.
