CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Russia's invasion of Ukraine is an outrageous attack on an independent country. It is a proud, peace loving nation with a rich history. The attack undermines the rule of law, breaches the UN charter and has the potential to create another humanitarian crisis across Europe. Ireland and Ukraine have strong political ties as well as social ones. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and our diplomats are working in Ukraine to evacuate Irish citizens caught up in the conflict. However, there are many Ukrainians here with ties to Ireland, who have family there, who are very worried about their safety. Will the Government waive the visa requirements and offer them humanitarian assistance to come to Ireland in the coming days and weeks?
