          <p eId="para_8">I welcome everyone to the meeting. Apologies have been received from Deputy Imelda Munster. In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, to be respectful of other people's physical space and to adhere to any other public health advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee. He is accompanied this morning by Mr. William Cronin, audit manager at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> This morning we engage with officials from the Department of Education to examine the following: the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 26 – Education; from the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2018 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services - Chapter 7, Purchase of sites for school provision; and from the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2019 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services - Chapter 8, Management of the schools estate. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the Secretary General, Ms Bernie McNally, could not be in attendance for today's meeting. As the Secretary General is the Department's Accounting Officer and that function cannot be delegated, I propose that we make the transcript of today's proceedings available to the Secretary General to allow her, in her capacity as Accounting Officer, to comment on or clarify any matters that arise during the course of the meeting. As a similar situation arose in respect of our meeting with the Department of Foreign Affairs last week, I also propose that we afford that Department's Accounting Officer the same opportunity. Is that agreed? Agreed. I wish Ms McNally well and hope she will be back in good fettle soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department of Education: Mr. Gavan O'Leary, assistant secretary, corporate services; Mr. Hubert Loftus, assistant secretary and head of the planning and building unit; Ms Deirdre Mc Donnell, assistant secretary and head of major operations and shared services; Mr. Harold Hislop, chief inspector; Ms Martina Mannion, assistant secretary; and Mr. Tom Whelan, principal officer and head of the finance unit. We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following assistant secretaries from the Department: Ms Aoife Conduit, Ms Deirdre Shanley and Mr. Tomás Ó Ruairc. In addition, we are joined by Ms Georgina Hughes-Elders, principal officer in the education Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off or in silent mode. Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege. However, three of today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness who is physically present. These witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 such that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> I now call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2022-07-07T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_16">Vote 26 was restructured in 2020 following the formation of the Government. Responsibility for the previous Vote programmes for higher education and science were transferred to the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. Responsibility for first level, second level and early years education remained with the renamed Department of Education.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> The appropriation account for Vote 26 - Education records gross expenditure of €8.6 billion in 2020. This was up 4.3% year-on-year relative to the comparable programme in 2019. In 2020, the largest element of spending was for the pay and pensions of current and former teachers and other school staff, amounting to €6.72 billion in total. Payments related to the provision of school buildings and extensions and other educational infrastructure totalled €848 million in 2020. This included €65 million in payments related to public-private partnership provision of schools. Expenditure on school transport totalled just under €225 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> On the receipts side, appropriations-in-aid of the Vote amounted to €355 million in 2020. The majority of these receipts are pension-related contributions from current education employees. It should be noted that employee contributions from employees who are members of the single public service pension scheme, recruited since January 2013, are remitted directly to Vote 12. For 2020, the surplus to be surrendered from Vote 26 was just under €138 million. This resulted from net underspending across the Vote subheads. I issued a clear audit opinion for the appropriation account for 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> In my annual report for 2018, I presented a report on the purchase between 2016 and 2018 of three high-value sites for school developments in Dublin city. The three sites in question were the former Rehab premises at Roslyn Park in Sandymount; the former greyhound racing stadium site in Harold's Cross; and buildings owned by the former Dublin Institute of Technology located in Cathal Brugha Street and Marlborough Street. The three sites were bought for a combined total of just over €67 million. Our focus was in establishing whether a well-defined business case was in place and how the Department of Education ensured value for money was achieved for the very substantial prices paid for the sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> In each case, it was noted that the sites acquired did not meet the Department's own guidelines for minimum site area for development of schools. In practice, given the challenges of developing schools in established urban areas, the Department was planning to maximise the potential of the sites, for example by locating both a primary and a post-primary school on the larger sites and by allowing for use of multistorey buildings. The report recommended that the Department should review its parameters for the size of sites required for schools to allow for more intensive development of sites in restricted areas. The Accounting Officer has provided additional information on how the sites have been utilised since the report was published in September 2019 and on progress being made to develop permanent school premises and facilities on these valuable sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The Department of Education has overall responsibility for management of the nation's schools estate, which comprises almost 4,000 premises and land serving a student population of around 950,000. This property represents an accumulated investment by taxpayers of many billions of euro. In my annual report for 2019, I sought to outline the Department’s arrangements for monitoring the condition of school properties, funding of maintenance and refurbishment and protection of the State's financial interest in those properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> Recommendations in the report include the conduct of a survey to assess the condition of schools nationwide in a consistent manner to facilitate strategic targeting of resources; the development of guidance and good practice information to assist schools in their maintenance responsibilities; the implementation of legal agreements where appropriate to protect the State's interest in the schools estate; and refinements in accounting practice. I am glad to report that all of the recommendations were accepted by the Department. The Accounting Officer has provided an update on progress made in implementing the recommendations since the publication of the report in September 2020.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">I welcome Mr. O'Leary and thank him for leading the delegation at short notice. I know it happened really quickly. As detailed in the letter of invitation, he has five minutes for an opening statement.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_4">
          <from> Mr. Gavan O'Leary<recordedTime time="2022-07-07T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_24">I am one of the assistant secretaries in the Department of Education. In beginning my statement, I have been asked to convey the sincere apologies of my Secretary General, Ms Bernie McNally, for not being able to attend the committee today. Unfortunately, she is unwell, and in line with current public health advice she is self-isolating and unable to be here.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> I thank the committee the invitation to attend today to discuss the Department of Education 2020 appropriation accounts, chapter 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2018, which deals with the purchase of sites for school provision, and chapter 8 of the 2019 report, which deals with the management of the schools estate. As indicated by the Chairman, I am joined by officials from the Department who will cover various aspects of the matters under discussion. We are also joined remotely by three assistant secretaries covering different areas of the Department. We have provided the committee with briefing material in advance and hope this has been of some assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> As the committee is aware, a new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science was established after the formation of the new Government in 2020. Functions previously performed by the Department of Education and Skills were transferred to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in 2020. The Vote 26 2020 accounts cover those functions that remain with the Department of Education and relate predominantly to primary and post-primary education.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The Department's net voted expenditure in 2020 was €8.379 billion. Of this, €925 million was capital expenditure. Net pay and superannuation account for approximately 78% of the Department's overall budget. In 2020, this provided for almost 93,000 public service employees and 42,000 public service pensioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> The Department’s programme expenditure now covers one programme area, namely, programme A. The overall net expenditure for 2020 was €8.241 billion and covered, for example, pay and superannuation costs for teachers and special needs assistants; grants to schools, including capitation payments; costs associated with teacher education; and provision of school transport. This sum also covered additional costs arising due to the impact on schools of Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Due to the transfer of functions I referred to earlier, the Department's Revised Estimates Volume, REV, was further revised to take account of the transfer of functions in 2020. Funding was also allocated as part of the further Revised Estimates process to cover costs arising due to Covid-19. In July 2020, the Government agreed a living with Covid package, which made funding available from the Covid-19 reserve fund to support the reopening of schools in September 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> As the impacts of Covid-19 developed, supplementary supports were also agreed during the remainder of 2020 and beyond. The funding for these supports totalled €639 million for the 2020-21 school year. Of this, €331 million was allocated for expenditure in 2020. This was allocated to cover additional costs arising due to Covid-19, such as additional substitution to cover teacher absences on sick leave, additional capital works to schools to enhance their safety in a Covid-19 environment, capitation for personal protective equipment, PPE, hand sanitisers etc. and school transport. The full amount was not spent in 2020. However, due to the uncertainties arising from Covid-19, it was prudent to make provision in the Vote for more negative scenarios in the later months of 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> Moving to procurement, the statement of internal financial control that forms part of the appropriation account provides details regarding the control systems in place. It also notes details of instances of non-compliance with public procurement rules. Such instances have arisen for reasons such as urgency, need for business continuity and sole supplier. The Department is vigilant regarding good procurement practice and is committed to following the guidance available. The Department is actively engaged with the procurement reform programme and is taking the opportunity to use centralised contracts and frameworks where appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> On the question of public sector reform, the statement on internal financial control also notes the Department activity in the area of shared services. The Department is advancing a range of initiatives across the entire education and training sector and is actively leading and participating in the rolling out of shared services.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> On the school capital programme, this committee meeting will also discuss chapter 7 on the purchase of sites for school provision and chapter 8 on the management of the schools estate. These chapters included a number of recommendations from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Department is actively addressing these recommendations, with significant progress made. The Department is taking every opportunity to continuously improve and strengthen its processes through its integration and harnessing of data, allowing for better strategic planning and delivery of its overall school building programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> I will mention briefly some developments in 2021 and 2022. The Covid-19 pandemic had an impact on the Department's activity in an unprecedented manner and the 2020 accounts. This impact has continued into 2021 and 2022. The education system's response was aligned to our core national priority of saving lives while being focused on ensuring continuity of education for learners, including a particular focus on more vulnerable students.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">On the Ukrainian crisis, the arrival of a large number of Ukrainian children of schoolgoing age has created challenges in finding school places for them and responding to their needs. There is a significant cost associated with this important work, which will be reflected in the 2022 accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> On special education needs, more than €2 billion of the Department’s budget is invested in special education needs. A significant amount has been achieved. For example, by the end of this year we will have 2,500 special classes across the country. However, there is still an amount to be done and the Department is working intensively to ensure that all children with special educational needs can access a high quality and inclusive education in their locality. I thank members for the opportunity to address the committee. We are happy to take any questions.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Deputy James O'Connor<recordedTime time="2022-07-07T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_37">I wish the Secretary General well and a speedy recovery. On a positive note, I recognise that 2020 was an exceptionally challenging year for the Department. It had to deal with a lot of new changes relating to Covid-19. Perhaps not everything was done right, but I imagine it was not a very easy experience for departmental staff. I also wish to acknowledge the work done by those on the front line in schools during that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> The first issue that I wish to raise is very much under discussion currently. It concerns the requirement for legislation to be rushed through to provide additional supports for children with special needs. It is an issue that is raised with me repeatedly. When I am running my constituency clinics, I am approached by many families looking for supports and school places for their children. The delivery of such supports and places in the Cork area is far behind where it needs to be. I am sure Ms Mannion will be aware of the issues in County Cork, in particular, and in south County Dublin, where the issue seems to be more acute than in other parts of the country. That represents a systems failure by the Department, and something that requires urgent action to be taken. I know that work is being done at the moment. I will provide an example. Recently, the Minister came to my constituency and we visited a number of schools. We visited one secondary school with more than 800 pupils, which has an allocation of just one SNA. That is shocking. This issue is being raised in other areas of the country. I am being repeatedly told, by school principals, that despite frequent requests being made to the local officer tasked with liaising between the Department and the schools, they are getting nowhere. That is affecting areas such as Midleton, Cobh and Glanmire. It is extremely serious. What is the Department doing to try to improve and build upon the work being undertaken to try to limit the scenario where the schools out there quite frankly cannot get the resources they require? As I mentioned earlier, I visited a school with 800 pupils to which only one SNA is allocated. That is not reflective of the needs of the students who require SNA support. </p>

          <p eId="para_46">The Department is committed to ensuring that every child has access to an appropriate placement to meet their educational needs. As the Deputy will be aware, the vast bulk of children in our school system are educated in the mainstream system, with access to special education teaching supports and SNAs. Approximately 1% of our children attend special schools, and another 1% are in special classes. The Deputy mentioned the Cork area. There are 244 special classes for children with ASD at primary level and 99 special classes for children at post-primary level in County Cork. That is a total of 343 special classes in the county. As my colleague, Mr. O'Leary, mentioned, we will have almost 2,500 special classes by the end of the year. In the context of setting out how we are supporting children, it is important to highlight that we have made significant investment in special education in recent years. There has been a fivefold increase in the number of special classes in the past decade. There are almost 19,000 SNAs in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> With regard to County Cork in particular, as the Deputy will be aware, we have opened one new special school in Carrigaline under the patronage of the education and training board, ETB. Another new special school will be opened in Rochestown later this year. The Deputy mentioned the challenges in south County Dublin, in particular. While there are challenges, overall, the development of special classes and special school provision across the country is going a significant way towards meeting the needs of children with special educational needs. Of course, we are conscious that we need to do more. The Deputy mentioned County Dublin. It might interest him to know that there are almost 336 special classes at primary level in County Dublin in 43% of all of the schools in the area. At post-primary level, almost 45% of the schools in the county have special classes. The number has significantly increased this year, notwithstanding that challenges remain in a small number of places. We are working closely with schools to ensure that we can deliver those places for September 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> The Deputy also made reference to the passing of legislation. We are grateful that the Dáil passed legislation relating to section 37A of the Education Act 1998 yesterday. The provision allows the Department and the Minister to have faster access to special classes, which is in the best interest of children with special educational needs. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, announced in May that for the third time, the process was being recommenced to allow for the delivery of extra special classes in the Dublin area. </p>
          <p eId="para_49"> On the issue of SNAs, as the Deputy will be aware, there are more than 19,000 SNAs-----</p>

          <p eId="para_50">I am sorry but I will have to stop Ms Mannion there. Time is limited. We have discussed the issue of SNAs. I appreciate her response. I mentioned gaps in provision. One of the areas affected is east Cork. I do not want to be parochial, but I want to use the area as an example. I am sure other members are aware of similar examples. If parents living in Youghal have a child with significant educational needs for whom mainstream education is not an option and he or she wants to attend one of the special schools, they are faced with having to travel to Cork city or Dungarvan. The journey to Cork city takes 50 minutes with no traffic, and 70 minutes if there is. The journey to Dungarvan takes 30 or 40 minutes. I acknowledge that the provision of transportation to special schools is not entirely within the Department's remit. I understand that the HSE has a role in the provision of these transportation services, and it does not transport children to special schools beyond the county boundary. To me, that is deeply frustrating. It is something that should be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> I will move on, because time is limited. I understand that Mr. Loftus has responsibility in the area of school construction and the building unit. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_53">The planning and building unit is shrouded in mystery. I am sure Mr. Loftus will be aware that I have tabled many parliamentary questions and have raised other issues of concern regarding school capacity in County Cork. My experience in dealing with the unit has been appalling. It has been one of the worst experiences that I have had in politics in engaging with any individual unit within the Civil Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">What epitomised it was the rapid build projects that were presented in 2012. There was a number of them around the country. One of them was in Carrigtwohill. At the time, it was the most expensive school project ever presented and one of the largest school capital developments in the history of the State. It was for a three-school campus. It was presented as a rapid build in 2012, but the sod has still not been turned on that project. It beggars belief that this is allowed to happen. There are other such instances. A major fire broke out in a school in Mallow in 2016. To this day the sod still has not been turned on the reconstruction of the damaged part of the school and additional facilities, which is appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> Can Mr. Loftus give an indication of why this happens? It is worth noting that it involves significant public funds. We are talking about hundreds of millions of euro and even billions of euro for capital projects for schools. Why is that allowed to drag on with no sense of accountability? Nobody seems to have been fired for the errors that took place in 2012. If it had happened in the private sector, someone would not last six months. I will give Mr. Loftus a chance to respond.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">I am disappointed if that is the perception the Deputy has of the planning and building unit. I came in as head of the unit in October 2017. One of my priorities was focusing on delivery of the national development plan. That is a significant programme of investment. It was revised last year and we have a €4.4 billion programme over the period 2021 to 2025. To give a sense of the scale of what we are delivering, between 2018 and 2021 we delivered almost 700 school building projects across the country. We do not focus on any particular area such as Cork or wherever. My job has a national remit and focuses on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">I have to give context in answering any question. In terms of the Education Act, building matters are dealt with more at patron or trust level than at board of management or school principal level. Obviously, they have a strategic interest there. When projects are being done, design teams are appointed. They are the professional people who are involved in projects. They have a remit and requirement under the design team procedures to provide monthly progress reports to the school authority, and that would typically be the board of management, on progress on those. In terms of the individual arrangements down at the detail of how the interaction with the board of management or school principal works, I am head of the planning and building unit with a remit across 4,000 schools so I do not get into the nitty-gritty of what happens within the bowels and boards of every school.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> At the more strategic level and at national level, we have a very large track record of delivery. We spend our allocation in our budgets. If our Department is compared to many others, and I am aware colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are present, ours is a Department that consistently delivers and spends in the capital area.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">The clock is ticking and I want to make one thing crystal clear. The model being used by the Department at present for the determination of where new schools are required is utterly flawed. Three and four years hence in east Cork, when the Department continues its current plan, which is not to construct a new additional secondary school in that area to serve the needs of the area, that model is going to fail. Extension after extension have been put onto approximately nine schools in the east Cork area over the past ten years, and they are all full. In the case of one school there are 600 pupils in prefabs. I am sure Mr. Loftus is aware of that in Carrigtwohill.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">It is daft that this has been allowed to continue. That is the one I referenced regarding the rapid build in 2012. I do not agree with Mr. Loftus when it comes to transparency, but the model that is being used is not looking at the demographic within the households; it is looking more at the construction of new housing. I think that is the model used. The information is not necessarily being taken from the census and it is not being used in the most efficient way it can be. Due to the rate of growth and development in a lot of metropolitan regions in the country, I urge that the model be adapted and changed as a matter of urgency to avoid what is currently happening in east Cork where there is a deficit of approximately 20, when the figures are boiled down. That is still a lot of children to be without a school place for September. I fear, from the information we have from the primary schools, that it will only get worse. Will Mr. Loftus give a brief reply?</p>

          <p eId="para_66">We have a huge amount of work done on reforming how we do our planning. We have a geographic information system, GIS, which brings data from the census, child benefit data and housing data together. The wider context here is that we are in a demographic downward trend with regard to primary schools. That is projected to fall by 100,000 over the next decade. That applies nationally, but it also applies to Cork. When we are looking at Cork and east Cork, we are looking at the demographics, the housing and where the primary is on the downward curve. The first port of call when dealing with extra provision is existing schools. That is consistent with Government policy on compact growth. Then we look at additionality and new schools. However, when one is looking at a 1,000-pupil school at post-primary level, for example, a lot of additional housing is required to achieve the cohort needed for that for a 50-year or 60-year lifespan there might be in that building. We are not far from peak at post-primary level in the east Cork area. If the Deputy wants a briefing, we are happy-----</p>

          <p eId="para_94">That would suggest that 41 sites outside of Dublin were acquired for €15 million or, basically, that two thirds of all sites were acquired for under 10% of the cost.

          <p eId="para_95">It can depend on whether the site is for a primary or a post-primary school. It can then depend on the size requirement. For example, in Leitrim a small primary school might be needed. In south Dublin a big 1,000-pupil post-primary might be needed. We have guidelines on site areas. Generally, at primary level, we might need, say, two acres to five acres and, at post-primary level, eight acres to 11 acres. Those are guidelines, however. We made it more explicit in our guidelines, following the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, that this is just guidance and that the size requirements are lower in urban areas. We looked to see how we could maximise the value of sites in terms of provision. Typically, we try to have campus sites wherever we can to maximise the value.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">We can provide that breakdown on a side-by-side basis.

That then guides our decision-making in respect of site requirements. More generally, however, as to where we are in respect of the cycle of demographics, at primary level, for the next decade or so, we will be in a downward spiral, with 100,000 or more fewer pupils.

The point I was going to make is that there would be less of a requirement for new schools in the context of that cycle of demographics.

          <p eId="para_104">That would be useful. When we deal with school applications for minor works or emergency works, my understanding is - I have lost the figure. Maybe the witnesses could direct me to the cost of those works annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> It strikes me that those works are often school-led in the sense that a school will make an application to the Department, which generally takes quite a long time. Then there are the likes of windows and other works that would have a benefit in terms of energy savings but also just for the obvious reasons. Is it the case that the Department acts only at the behest of boards of management? If, for example, a board of management is not as robust in checking the quality of windows, is the Department not proactive in assessing the standard of buildings?</p>

          <p eId="para_106">I will make just a general point. Looking at maintenance and how it is done currently, and the mechanisms and schemes in place to facilitate that, we have the minor works grant. That is for primary schools and is typically of the order of €30 million annually. There is the emergency works scheme and the summer works scheme. They are the main mechanisms. Typically, that would be in or around €100 million a year in total. The figure can go up or down a bit, but that is the average. Obviously, an emergency is an emergency, so that is school-led or there might be an architect or whoever else out at a school. The minor works scheme is a mechanism to enable schools to do small-scale works and gives them the flexibility for that. The summer works scheme is a multi-annual scheme. There are various categories of works within that. Schools then apply on that basis. We work through that in priority order. In that regard, first, as part of our climate agenda, we will have a strong climate action focus in respect of summer works. There will be more clarity on that in the autumn in terms of detail and an application process for schools. Second, coming back to the point Deputy Carthy raises, we are moving towards a more system-led approach to maintenance to help pick up on the scenarios to which he alludes of a school principal or a school that may not be doing as much on the maintenance front. As part and parcel of that and of forward-planning from a climate perspective, we are doing energy profiling of the school estate. We have 580 schools currently being surveyed as a first tranche of those, and we envisage the bulk of the balance of schools to be done over the course of 2023 and 2024. That then gives a clear picture of where the priorities are from a system perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Obviously, schools can pick stuff up as well. A combination of both will go through.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">I thank all the departmental officials for the work they have been doing, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. It has been a challenging time.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> Turning to deal with the schools building process and the process we have regarding schools building projects, and especially the tendering process, the whole context of the system has now changed. A tender could be submitted today and the price for that project could be completely different in six months’ time. Has there been an examination of the current tendering process? I raise this issue because I was involved with a school where the contract was offered to the lowest tenderer. There was, however, a substantial delay from when the tenders for that project were received to the time the offer was made. The tenderer could not then take the contract at the relevant price. The contractor offered to undertake the project for a slightly higher amount but that would still have been below the value of next lowest tender. The Department’s attitude was that it could not do that and that the price could not be adjusted once it had been submitted. It ended up that the contract in question went to the fifth tenderer. The other four companies that tendered said they could not undertake the project at the prices they had originally submitted. The whole project cost approximately €1 million more than envisaged, whereas if the Department had negotiated with the lowest tenderer, €750,000 would have been saved. Has a review of the tendering process been undertaken? What are the mechanisms for dealing with tendering now in view of the changing situation in this regard, with building costs increasing substantially in a short period?</p>

          <p eId="para_112">Across the construction sector, whether involving schools or other projects, we are seeing issues impacting construction inflation. These include Covid-19, Brexit, the war in Ukraine and supply chain issues. Therefore, it is a difficult and challenging environment. From the Department’s perspective, we have revised our basic building cost limit, which acts as a guideline and reflects tender prices, etc. We have updated that cost limit by 21% since May 2021. It has gone from €1,640 per sq. m to €1,990 per sq. m. From our perspective, we are anxious to ensure that projects get to the construction stage and that we keep a good, steady flow of projects going to construction all the time. Currently, we have more than 250 projects at the construction stage. We are conscious of getting them through. The current environment in the context of inflation has made that more challenging to achieve. We are conscious and appreciative of the work by the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, in respect of helping to manage the situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">The problem is really with the timescale from when tenders are received to when the contract is awarded to the tenderer the Department deems appropriate to undertake the job. Has this aspect been examined in respect of determining whether it can be expedited to secure progress and move these projects forward? I know of other projects, not involving this Department, where there was such a delay in accepting the tender that the company awarded it walked off the site and said it was not possible to undertake the project. The delay was such that it looks now like that project will have to go back out to a public invitation to seek new tenders to undertake the work.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">From the Department’s perspective, we have no strategic interest in delaying any projects getting to the stage where work can be undertaken on-site. Regarding the turnaround times, from our perspective, that is something we do quickly. Any issues that would delay the process are probably more on the tenderers’ side. They may be concerned about whether they have the capability to stand over their tender prices in the current difficult and challenging inflation environment. The important point I was making earlier is that the OGP has updated the contractual arrangements in the context of public works contracts and put a co-operational framework in place in respect of dealing with inflation on existing projects. This all helps to create a better climate and conditions to enable contractors and tenderers to stand over their prices.</p>

Those all help to reduce the lead-in period from a procurement perspective and, ultimately, to get projects to the stage where work is carried out on-site quickly.

We set out a list of 396 schools that had rented prefabs at the start of 2021. That equates to about 10% of schools overall. We then did a review at the end of 2021. Over the course of that year, about 12% of those rentals had ceased. We had building projects in train for about 80% of those schools and we were working through the balance in respect of a delivery mechanism.</p>

That figure has come down significantly from when it peaked in 2008 at around 8%. Therefore, in respect of temporary accommodation and when it might be needed, and the pressure points in that regard, this might be dictated more by the demographics and the flow of demographics.

          <p eId="para_156">The process by which schools are supported into the DEIS process involves an algorithm that effectively identifies a number of factors. Postcode is one factor that feeds into the system. It feeds into that part of the system that identifies the HP index, which identifies deprivation within an area. The system is configured such that information which is unique to each child is fed into the system. That information in turn allows us to identify where there are particular challenges. It includes, for instance, information relating to unemployment. In the current iteration of the data programme, we included information on where there was homelessness and other factors that we felt-----</p>

          <p eId="para_159">It is a very simple question. If the Department is now using postcodes to identify whether a school should be given DEIS status, how does that identify whether the resident in a postcode owns the property, is a housing assistance payment, HAP, tenant, or in receipt of social welfare? In those cases, the Department's algorithm is not working because I know of a number of schools where DEIS status should absolutely be applied and is not. They have failed in appeals. As Deputy O'Connor said earlier, I suggest our system is badly flawed and our children will suffer greatly because of it. Does Ms Mannion agree with that? Does she believe she is happy with how DEIS status is determined?</p>

I am not saying it is the witnesses' fault but they can surely agree that it is outrageous. I know of a number of unsuccessful appeals and the matter makes no sense whatsoever. I will ask for this committee to recommend a complete review of all the schools that have not been given DEIS status.

          <p eId="para_190">There are five stages. We take a structured approach, in line with the public spending code, to the appraisal, design, tendering and construction. The value of that structured approach means that projects are well-designed and well-developed before going to tender and construction. For the benefit of the committee, we have recently done a review of projects that have a contract price, which is the tender price, to see how that compares with the final account. That can be an indication of what particular issues might have arisen on-site. Across a large number of projects-----</p>

          <p eId="para_195">At times, there does not appear to be a continued focus on the various stages. Other Deputies have raised issues in their constituencies. I represent Dún Laoghaire and I am aware of a particular school which has been in prefabricated units on-site since 2005. The State pays for the upkeep and maintenance of the prefabs annually. About three years ago, one of the prefabs was condemned. We thought that was wonderful because the prefabs would be moved, but instead the State purchased or rented another prefab. The school has been on this temporary site for about 27 years, although the Department owns it. Mr. Loftus outlined five stages, which sound quite simple, but I know it is complex. The Department probably selects land owned by the council or State land first and then if that is not available, it seeks to acquire land, if possible. I am sure Mr. Loftus will agree that 27 years is a long time to spend in prefabs. It has an impact on the school, although not on the quality of education, which is excellent. It has an impact when people visit it. When will the prefabs be replaced or when will there be a permanent building? I will come back to that in a second.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> The Department had capital expenditure of €4.1 billion in 2021. Some €165 million was spent on temporary accommodation, according to the briefing note supplied to us. Some €29.4 million was spent on renting temporary accommodation. Does €165 million include the €29.4 million or is that in addition to it? I know those are not all prefabs and that temporary accommodation could include other things. Do the witnesses have a figure for how much the Department spent on prefabricated units in the period we are discussing, which is 2021? Does the €165 million for temporary accommodation include the €29.4 million for temporary rental accommodation?</p>

          <p eId="para_197">Our annual spend on rentals is about €29 million. It is consistently around that level over the years. An area I have looked at as head of the planning and building unit is broadening out our different delivery mechanisms to maximise the roll-out of the national development plan. Part and parcel of that was looking at modular accommodation and the creation of a modular accommodation framework. That is very positive from the climate agenda because it works off a decarbonised heating strategy. One variation of that which we put in place this year was a timber-frame modular framework. When looking at the spend, the recurring annual spend is the €29 million and the investment that we put into modular accommodation or other delivery projects is more general investment. The modular accommodation has a 60-year lifespan.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">I appreciate that. Of the €29.4 million, I am not saying that all of that is in respect of prefabricated units that are there for long-term accommodation but how much of it is reoccurring? I mean prefabricated units that are being used on a continuous basis as either a school or an extension to a school. Does the Department have that figure?</p>

          <p eId="para_201">As I said earlier, we did a review of 396 projects that were in rented prefabs at the start of 2021. Some 12% of those schools were no longer in prefabs at the end of 2021 and we had a building pipeline for 80% of the remainder in terms of a pathway forward. There will be new projects coming into the pipeline too but in the main, with the way the demographics have evolved, I would see fewer new ones coming into rentals. My approach would be more to purchase modular accommodation and for that to become a solution and more the norm.</p>

          <p eId="para_203">We are engaging with those schools to see what the pathway forward is for them and whether they need a building project solution or whether the demographics are evolving in those areas in relation to those schools. In terms of forward planning, we have good capacity for primary and post-primary levels. At post-primary level nationally, we have around 20,000 school places as capacity in the system and at primary level, we have capacity of the order of 50,000 school places in existing classrooms and other spare classrooms too. Earlier, we used Dublin as an example of an area under pressure. We have primary schools with about 80 spare classrooms. Those are the areas that we are looking at in the context of reconfiguration for special classes or if the Government decides to change the pupil-teacher ratio or whatever.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">That is all very important. The demographics of those areas can speak to why there is spare capacity. I ask the Department to look at the building I mentioned from 2005 and follow up with a detailed note please. The roll number is 20056P.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> Finally, there is a small extension that began in a school with the roll number 19258U. It started in August 2019. It is overdue by 12 to 14 months. The school has tried to engage with the Department and the contractor. Principals are becoming project managers here. Many of them do not have the time, resources or the skill set to do this. Yet the Department is paying a contractor to do work but the contractor is not on site. In such instances, what can the Department do to ensure the contract is done and dusted and that ultimately kids can go into that classroom? What happens then?</p>

There is a design team there and its job is to manage the delivery. One thing I have done as part of reforming how we do our business and setting us up more strategically to do that is to put in professional management supports. We put them into education and training boards. They are a good support for delivering projects both inside and outside of the education and training board sector. There are also buildings officers in other key stakeholders too. There are a lot of professional supports being put in there to help, streamline and support delivery. If there is a particular case we will certainly look into it and get back to the Deputy.</p>

It involved work that had to be done within the Department of Education because it could not be carried out by the State Examinations Commission, SEC, as it had not legal authority to carry out the work. An executive office, using the executive powers of the Minister was established within the Department. Staff from various parts of the Department and the SEC were seconded into the calculated grades executive office and were devoted to it. Work was contracted to a company, Polymetrika International, based in Canada. That company had helped in the initial stages with research and development of the ideas of how a calculated grades system could operate. We were in entirely uncharted territory. We had 60,000 students for whom we could not run a leaving certificate. There was a great deal of work to be done on how it would be possible to create grades that would be fair to those students and their ability over the time that they had studied.</p>

The clerk of works is a support role because the clerk is there on a full-time basis whereas an architect might only visit the site every week or so. The clerk is able to provide records and clarify issues or queries that an architect might have about the project.</p>

In terms of planning, the project to complete the construction phase seems a long way off. According to a response to a parliamentary question, a demographic analysis of the construction element was being undertaken even though the project had been approved. I am trying to get an understanding of a project’s life cycle. My colleagues have already discussed this, but it would be useful if the committee was given an understanding of durations, project stages and what is required. Principals are asking us questions because they have no connection with the Department. There is a gap, so I ask the witnesses to provide this information when they have the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_253">It is the patron or trustee, which could be a diocesan trust or a general trust, that owns the school. Those trusts are typically set up as a charity and the objects of that charity would ultimately determine how sale proceeds and so on can be used. From the perspective of the Department and the Minister, we are looking at how we can ensure that where there is a need for a school, that a building that is sold will be retained as a school.

          <p eId="para_260"> We all have concentrated on our own areas, and possibly because it is easier to describe things. Kildare - I represent part of it - doubled in population between the 1970s and the 1990s and it doubled in population again between the 1990s and now. According to the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, the largest class sizes in the country are in Kildare. It is a sizeable population and had the biggest number of commencement notices of any county last year. The trend is set to continue. As a consequence, education will be a big feature.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> I will pick a few things out, where some things are done well and the schools are delivered. There is a lot of stuff that there are queries on. I would like to ask Mr. Loftus about Magee Barracks, for example, in Kildare town, which was sold by the Department of Defence for €8 million. The land was then rezoned for housing. Then the Department of Education purchased a site at an inflated price for the construction of a school. Putting it benignly, that seems to be the wrong, and more expensive, way to do things. Given the profile of a county that is growing in population, why was it not foreseen that there would be a need for a school and this was a potential site?</p>

          <p eId="para_262">I am conscious I am head of the planning and building unit since October 2017 and I cannot necessarily know the history of life that went on before. As a general comment, the school that is going in there, which is the Curragh Post-Primary School, is being done as part of a regional solution. It is not necessarily the case that that particular school at that particular site is serving that particular town. That is an important point to make.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">If Mr. Loftus cannot answer me about that particular school, I would like to get an answer or a note on that because I am finding it difficult to get information by way of parliamentary question. However, that, effectively, is what has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> I would like to ask Mr. Loftus about another one where there was a problem. It was on the building programme and should have commenced in 2018. I refer to the Mercy Convent in Naas. A 24-classroom school, it is not completed yet because we have gone to stage 6 as opposed to stage 5. Stage 6 is when one's contractor terminates and one has to re-tender. That is my description of it anyway. There will be additional costs associated with that. I would like to know why the contract was terminated. It is important that we understand why this happened so that it does not happen again. There would have been additional costs in that there was security on the site on a permanent basis. There were temporary buildings put in for a protracted period of time because the pupils were there and required the accommodation. At one point, there were subcontractors shut out of the site. Obviously, there would be an additional cost associated with that because they could not get their plant and equipment. It is to go back to tender now. It certainly will not be completed until there is a tender and somebody gets back in on the site. It is unlikely to be completed this year. It should have commenced in 2018. One would nearly build the children's hospital in the time that it will take to build this particular school. Can Mr. Loftus give us some indication of how one prevents that kind of, not unique but unusual, thing happening where it will add to the cost and create chaos? There are children who have gone through their entire schooling in temporary accommodation because of what has happened there. Does Mr. Loftus know what happened there?</p>

          <p eId="para_265">The Deputy is correct that the situation is not unique but I would say it is very unusual. The issue there relates to the contractor. I suppose what one has with a contractor, and a tendering, is the contractor committing on a contractual duty to deliver a project to the standard required within a set timeframe and that was not being delivered. That would be the context for the termination there. To follow procurement rules, that requires a re-tendering and that is the issue that has led to the delay in this case.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">I would not necessarily think so but, if we are coming back to the Deputy with a note, we can clarify that. I suppose what one has there is a design team. An architect would be the lead on that. He or she would be the employer's representative. The architect's job would be to make sure that the contractor is delivering on its contractual obligations. The judgment and assessment that was done there was that a termination was appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_271"> There are some questions I myself have on the clerk of works issue at the hearing in October 2020. It is well-established now that the problems that arose in large building projects in the eight or ten years before that arose, were not - the design of the building was not changed - because the architect fell down but because there was no supervision from the employer's representative - in other words, the Department - on site. One of the major problems was simply down to the wall-ties not being dropped on the concrete blocks when the two sets of walls were being constructed. I note now that the Department has committed to, and confirmed that there is, a clerk of works on every large project site and I welcome that. Generally, is the clerk of works an employee of the Department? I want to keep the questions short.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">No, no. Hold on a second. There is a contractor engaged. There is a design team or project team. I understand all that, but that was not where the problem was arising. The problem was arising because, to put it straight, there was not somebody there on behalf of the taxpayer or the Department. I mentioned that here two years ago. It may seem like an old-fashioned suggestion but it seems like a common sense suggestion to me that there would be a clerk of works. Typically, the clerk of works would not have gone through university. The person might originally have been a carpenter. Most of them were carpenters.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">On small schools, I have a bit of a concern. I read the material in respect of the issues we raised two years ago. It is a bit flaky in terms of what happens with the smaller schools. Mr. Loftus will appreciate that with smaller schools, you will not have a clerk of works standing on the site all day. He clarified that in the context of larger projects, clerks of works are present the whole time, which is welcome. With a smaller school, however, do they visit regularly, maybe weekly? Are the visits unannounced? Give a brief answer to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">One last thing. I attended the opening at Trumera the other day. It is a fantastic job, and well done to everyone involved. It is a very small school - probably the smallest one that will be opened this year - and it looks fantastic. Would a clerk of works have been visiting that site regularly? I am just trying to get an indication here that, from a public accounts point of view, the interests of the taxpayer and the State are being protected.</p>

          <p eId="para_343">Thanks for that. By and large the scheme works very well. There are problems with it from time to time, and especially this time of the year. Inevitably, some parents will come to us, or schools will come to us and I want to raise this with the officials. I spent the morning of last Monday week trying to get through to the school transport section in the Department in Tullamore or trying to speak with a human being, and I failed. I want to address this with the officials. If we go back ten years ago, I would probably have been able to phone somebody on the couple of occasions every year when there were problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">That is not possible now. All of the phones ring out. If people are working from home and they are supposed to be able to take calls, if they are not connected up by phone, they cannot work from home. I know people who are working from home, such as my sister-in-law. When the phone rings in her office, it rings twice and goes directly to her mobile phone. She can work two days a week at home. The point I am making is that there is no answering service and no way of leaving a message. I cannot get a name of anybody. I appeal to Department officials, on foot of what I am raising, to give me a name and phone number of somebody. If they cannot do it now, maybe one of them can do it after the meeting. I am raising it here because I am at my wits' end with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> We talked about demographics. The demographic situation in the Portlaoise area, as Mr. Loftus would know, is that the population is increasing. Great work is being done providing new schools. There is still a need for new school buildings, for example at Kolbe Special School. There is a situation where there are no primary places. Children from a number of different households and backgrounds, including foreign nationals and some Traveller children, are affected. There are 21 children who need a bus to go Barnashrone National School. The principal and I were told that each one of those has been informed they have to go through a section 29 appeal. It will take much time to work its way through, and these are people whose first language is not English. I have a copy of a letter from the three primary schools in Portlaoise town that states they are full and have no spaces. Barnashrone National School is a DEIS school. It is suitable for these students. It is in the Mountmellick area. As it happens, it is only about 4 miles out the road and about 3 miles from where I live. It has the space and it is a wonderful school. If the school inspector looks at it, he or she will see it is a school that has performed very well. As a DEIS school, it has taken many children who have certain challenges and it has been very good. That needs to be looked at. If they have to go through a section 29 appeal, surely once the schools in the Portlaoise catchment area have confirmed that there are no spaces, that should be done and dusted.</p>

          <p eId="para_346">I am aware of the case. I know that the Chair wrote recently to the Secretary General in respect of this and that we have issued a letter by return.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> On the first point the Chair raised, I can only apologise for the customer service if he could not get through on the phone. I can certainly provide him with a phone number and the name of an official he could contact directly.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> On the particular case, we have written to him clarifying the position. In terms of eligibility, as the Chair knows, eligibility for transport is based on one’s nearest school. After that, it is based on one’s second nearest school and so on. The principal and parents have been advised that there is no requirement for a section 29 process to be undergone. Confirmation from the principals of all the schools between that family and the school they wish to attend will be required to confirm that there are no places available in those schools. That is the position on that. We are happy to follow up with the Chair on that if he requires further clarification.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">That was the initial information we were given. I do not want to be too parochial about it, but I wish to ask a question. There are 21 children concerned here. If Ms Conduit can come back to me with the name and phone number of the contact person in the school transport section in Tullamore, that would be helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> I wish to address the assistant secretaries here. I am favour of people working from home. I think it is a good thing for a whole lot of reasons. However, if somebody who has to be available to take a phone call cannot take a phone call at home, then he or she cannot work from home. There cannot be a system like that. There is not an answering service and one cannot leave a voicemail. The whole thing is completely circled. There is a wall that one cannot get through. That is deeply frustrating. We have parents, boards of management and principals coming to us and asking if we can get in contact with somebody. That is a crazy situation and it cannot be tolerated. It is not acceptable. There is close to €9 billion going into the Department every year and if there cannot be somebody to answer a phone in the school transport section, it is totally unacceptable. It is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> There are people in the Department who are able to take phone calls and are accessible, whether it is for school principals or a local Deputy or Minister. I just want to make that point; I do not want to labour it. </p>

The general point I would make is that is the very same approach and logic that we have been using in terms of providing and identifying school accommodation options for all of the Ukrainian children who are in our schools. There are more than 7,000 of them. We set up teams at ETB level with the wider stakeholders as well. We in the planning and building unit provide those teams with all of the capacity information about all of the schools and where the children are enrolled.

          <p eId="para_387">I am a newly elected Deputy and I have engaged a lot with the special needs and disability sectors. Recently I met the family of two very special needs children, both intellectually and physically, who are now adults and their transition from primary to post-primary education was extremely difficult. In 2001, a fundamental part of their education in terms of the delivery of special needs was the provision of a special needs assistant who worked on a one-on-one basis. When I met the mother of these boys recently her attitude was that in 2011 when one-on-one interaction was taken away it resulted in negative impacts on one of her sons who had fewer requirements then than his brother and would have been capable of holding down a job or living alone. In 2011, the assistance was removed and it has never been put back. Assistance is now provided on a piecemeal basis and the teacher decides what is required and who gets what, which is counterproductive and costs the Exchequer more in the long run. Has the Department of Education carried out a value-for-money analysis, and I hate to use the term "value-for money" in this instance, following removal of that system of special needs education and assistance compared with the current services provided? Does the Department cut ties when special needs children reach 18 years and, therefore, are no longer in the Department's education system?</p>

We have a number of strategies to support the transitions of children with special education needs. In the first instance, we have a steering group that rotates the Chair between the HSE and the National Council for Special Education, which has at its heart a process to provide access for all school leavers who require specialist support through an appropriate transition programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">The Deputy has raised an important issue about the effectiveness of the special needs assistant and the teaching resources for children with special educational needs. International evidence suggests that the best people to work with children with special educational needs are those who are most highly trained and, therefore, the teaching staff so the degree to which one can maximise face-to-fact contact between the student and the teacher is the best way to ensure the best outcomes for the child. That means if one wants to support the child in the longer term, and get the very best outcomes, it is better to put the resources, to a greater extent, into providing teachers, and huge numbers of teachers have been put into the system, rather than into special needs assistants. There are some children who obviously have physical and other needs so a special needs assistant is absolutely vital to them for either toileting or mobility reasons. It is important that the provision of special needs assistants does not get between the teacher and the student. The evidence from a lot of international studies is that special needs assistants or classroom assistants can, in some cases, become a barrier between the teacher and the child. So it is really important that the emphasis is placed on the provision of the teaching, and teaching of a very high skill, for the good long-term outcomes of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> The age of the child is relevant as we talk about special needs assistants. Young children often do need a special needs assistant and often benefit from one. For the psychological and long-term well-being of the child, as the children become older many do not want a special needs assistant. If one is not careful in how that is managed, the children feel they are being undermined in their own development and maturity because of a special needs assistant tagging along. It is a really delicate operation to choose when and when not to use the special needs assistant. The very best people to make decisions about that are probably the principal of the school and the teachers involved. </p>

What we are seeing, and certainly what has been explained in all of the schools that I have visited, is that the SNA, and the allocation of an SNA - especially when a SENO is asked for input - concentrates on the physical ability of the child as opposed to the intellectual capability.</p>

I was trying to explain to the Deputy that the quality of the teaching input is the most vital part of the provision made for the child. The evidence suggests that the more we can give the teacher support and facilitate the teacher's engagement with the child, then the better the intellectual, social, cognitive and other development of the child will be.</p>

Regarding new schools, the vast bulk of new schools are done through a patronage competition. Most of those are multi-denominational. It is not necessarily a competition <i>per se</i>, but it reflects the survey undertaken of the local parental community in respect of what sort of school provision is deemed desirable in the area. Typically, those schools are being established in buildings owned by the Minister. The school entity which is set up is a tenant in the pre-built schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_428">Let us picture a scenario whereby we have a Catholic school in a patron-owned building and that school reconfigures, for argument’s sake, into an Educate Together school or a community national school. The existing live school reconfigures. The ownership of the building itself remains with the patron or trustee. The building does not come over with the school <i>per se</i>. Therefore, it is nearly the reverse of the situation where a building is owned by the Minister. The reconfigured school in this scenario is essentially a tenant in the building already there.</p>

They reflect the circumstances of an individual school in respect of the level of investment that might have been made in that school in modern times, for example, as well as the level of future investment that might be planned. Those are the types of factors that come into play in that kind of scenario. To give the Deputy a guide, some schools would have been done through that process in the past and the sorts of rental arrangements might have been of the order of 10% of what might have been deemed local market rents.</p>

          <p eId="para_432"> Turning to another topic, can we get an update on what has happened with the Harold’s Cross site? This matter came up in previous meetings of this committee in respect of the valuation. It happened to be the exact figure that the then Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, was indebted to. Some €23 million was paid for that site, which had restrictive zoning. It was subsequently zoned for education. At the time, there was a question mark about the valuation, because it would have been very different if the valuation had been in the context of educational and institutional as opposed to residential. A residential zoning was the comparator used when the site was purchased. What has happened on that site? What level of investment is expected in the land purchased?</p>

          <p eId="para_433">The Harold’s Cross site has six acres. It was bought in May 2018 for €23 million. The cost was determined by the Valuation Office, using relevant local comparators. Under Department of Public Expenditure and Reform procedures, that is the appropriate mechanism for determining the valuation. The Valuation Office produced the valuation that was binding on the Department of Education and on the IGB. That was the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> It is a six-acre site and we are using it for two schools. One is a 1,000-pupil post-primary school, Harold’s Cross Educate Together Secondary School, and the other is a 16-classroom primary school, Harold’s Cross Educate Together National School. That is the long-term plan. This major project has gone through the design phase and into the detailed design stage. We have gone through the planning permission process. An Bord Pleanála appeals have impacted on our timeline. We are at the stage now, however, where this project is going out to tender later this year. Our intention is to be on-site in 2023. In the meantime, we have put some interim accommodation on that site to meet the need, conscious that our timelines have been impacted by the planning permission process.</p>

          <p eId="para_438">It was on the list to acquire a site. There are three schools on one campus in<b>
						</b>Donaghcumper in Celbridge. This was all under the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA. There was some progress on acquiring the site quite recently. I talked to the Department about the demographics in north Kildare. There will be a pinch point next year with regard to the secondary school, and a primary school has been based in permanent prefabs since it was founded. The other school I particularly want to ask about and is St. Raphael's Special School, which is attended by very highly dependent children and children who require medical assistance. The school had difficulty taking in pupils because of the accommodation. When does Mr. Loftus expect permission to be applied for in respect of those schools? When are they likely to be delivered?

As the Deputy said, there was NAMA involvement. It took a while to get it over the line. We have been looking at our best delivery mechanisms to deliver on that project. It will be a major campus project and it will be great when it is done. Obviously, it is taking longer than we would have liked given the issues in terms of getting the site.

At a more general level, the Department would have been looking at all opportunities for getting sites as quickly as possible through the State and through NAMA, and everything else as part of its site acquisition programme.

In the seven years between 2012 and 2019, there was a spend of €4.1 billion on them, with €3 billion on major capital programmes and the rest on maintenance, summer schemes, etc. There was a recommendation from the Chief State Solicitor's office in 2009 that the Department of Education would implement a legal agreement to protect the interests of the State. There is a significant risk to the State's investment, which should be safeguarded, if there is a change in patron or the site is sold to a third party. What has happened in the interim? The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted this in his 2018 report. Recommendation 1.3 was that the Department should ensure that legal agreements are in place between it and the school authorities in order to ensure that the members' interests are protected, and that this should be done as a matter of urgency. I understand that has not happened to date. What is the position in this regard?</p>

Where it is patron-owned, the deed of confidant in charge is where we have engaged with the Chief State Solicitor's office. One of the things on which I have engaged with the Chief State Solicitor's office and my own team is that we take a more strategic approach on this. A patron or trust might own maybe 100 schools. Rather than doing individual legal agreements for 100 schools 100 times, I have tasked our team to see whether we can be more strategic and have an overarching agreement that can manage and do that in a more strategic way without having an army of work or army of cost sitting in the Chief State Solicitor's office, Department of Education or the Property Registration Authority. Equally, it is far more efficient for the patrons as well. That is the area we are actively engaging with the-----</p>

          <p eId="para_459">Generally, we are very happy with the engagement we have. We work very collaboratively with the local authorities and, in fairness, equally with patrons and trustees. To give the Chairman one example, we have had much engagement with the Spiritan Education Trust. One part of that is a large site in south Dublin at Templeogue. What we are doing as part of that engagement is opening up opportunities for another school to go on that site, which will be a special school to cater for 150 students. That saves us the cost of a site in south Dublin, which is significant, but it also makes real added value in terms of special school provision for south Dublin.</p>

It is going to be difficult to disaggregate the extra ones who go on this year’s as distinct from people already in the system. We will be able to give the committee the total number of SNAs who are on the payrolls, both the Department payroll and the ETB payrolls.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">That is fine. With regard to how they are allocated, I know there are always debates about this issue and the inspector over that section, Mr. Hislop, outlined the criteria and how the assessment is done. I want to highlight with regard to the allocation of funding for such schools that, as I see it, there are different levels of need and there are situations where children's level of psychological or physical disability would not be very intense. However, the Kolbe school has been told it is overstaffed. I visited the school a number of times and I know the students have very intense needs, both psychological and physical. The first time I was there, I came away and wondered to myself how anyone would get through a day, given the level of need the children have is so intense. However, the school has been told it is overstaffed. Children stay there until they are 18 years of age and there are teenagers there who are a lot bigger than me, which presents significant challenges. I do not want to go into too much detail but I have witnessed it at first hand. The staff are really challenged and people have been injured, and there are many things I could say about it to the Department privately. We cannot have a situation where the criteria are the same for that school. I appeal to the Department and Mr. Hislop to examine that.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> The parents are greatly challenged and the summer period is very difficult for them. When children go to the Kolbe school during the day in the normal school term, it gives parents of bit of breathing space, but the staff take over and it is a very challenging situation for them. Speaking on behalf of the parents and staff, for September the school needs a couple of extra SNAs, given what they are saying to me, and I appeal to the Department to look at that.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">I appreciate that. I want to make clear that the general allocation we are talking about in terms of teachers and SNAs to special schools and special classes is what comes with the opening of the special class, so it is one teacher and two SNAs in a class of six children in either a special class or a special school. However, we absolutely understand there will be children within those cohorts who will need individual SNAs to support them through their education. The National Council for Special Education will work with schools to ensure that where the needs of those children merit an individual SNA - I did not get the opportunity to say this to Deputy Verona Murphy before she left - the system has not changed in terms of individual children no longer needing an SNA or no longer being able to access an individual SNA, if that is what they require. If the level of care need is such that an individual SNA is required for an individual child, the NCSE has the scope to provide that in those circumstances to those children.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">It is good to hear that. I have been in units in special schools where children had special needs. While I do not want to be parochial about it, I could not go home today with a clear conscience not having raised that. The level of need in Kolbe is far higher. It has an extra three or four pupils coming in this September. I do not need to remind Mr. Loftus about the building, which is of the worst standard. They are still in prefabs. There is only one solid classroom unit and everything else is prefabs. That is difficult enough in an ordinary school, for want of a better term. However, there are children with challenging behaviour and severe physical and psychological disabilities in this school, yet there is no sensory space and all of that is missing, which compounds the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> I ask the Department to keep its foot on the accelerator. The school has been told to go to tender. I appeal to the building unit of the Department to push that on as much as it can. The Department might come back to me, on foot of today's meeting, with a note on where things stand and whether the timeline for the next stage can be expedited.</p>

          <p eId="para_481">Grangegorman has moved over and that is under the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. The Department of Education purchased Cathal Brugha Street, which was a former DIT building, and Rathmines. At Cathal Brugha Street, we did a lease arrangement with the City of Dublin ETB and that provides us with a very good opportunity for four schools with 2,500 students in permanent accommodation, and with significant special needs provision. That is a good strategic use of that asset from a State perspective and creates a college of further education in the north part of the city, which would be good for the north inner city as well. To answer the question about Grangegorman, that is under the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. We have a primary school on the margins of that campus which is currently under construction.</p>

          <p eId="para_496"> In the first category of correspondence in which members have flagged items for discussion is No. 1324 B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. It is dated 23 June and provides information requested by the committee on the updated interim remedial national broadband plan. The Secretary General clarifies that the mechanism by which sanctions are applied under the contract is by way of reduction of subsidy payments to National Broadband Ireland.

          <p eId="para_497">The Department has said the national broadband plan is 12 months behind schedule. Eight and a half of those months have been attributed to Covid, which is strange when one considers that works were permissible throughout the Covid period. The correspondence does not indicate whether a sanction has been applied to date regarding the other three and a half months' delay, which the Department accepts is not Covid related. It seems the Department is stating if remedial targets are hit it will not impose a sanction. I request that we seek clarification on whether any penalties have been applied. The target was that 60,000 homes would be passed by the end of 2021. In January, the figure was only 34,000. The most up-to-date figure I have is from mid-June, when 56,600 premises had been passed. This means as of the summer we have not even met the targets set down for the end of last year. It would be useful if we were to receive an update on the current milestones, particularly the number of premises that have been passed to date, and get an update on whether sanctions have been applied.</p>

With regard to sanctions, the second part of the letter mentions that for the non-achievement of network builds and associated milestones within the time limit determined in the contract the delay payment arising can only be calculated once the respective milestone is complete. It states that in the event of the non-achievement of performance targets for operating and maintaining the network, financial sanctions will be imposed by way of reduction of future subsidy payments due to National Broadband Ireland. I take it from this that a sanction has not been imposed, but we will seek clarification.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">The original target for premises to be passed by the end of January this year was 115,000. Then the revised plan was 60,000. These are premises to be passed and not connected. The number being connected is far smaller. Something that concerns me is that when the legislation was going through the House, I raised this issue and so did a number of other people with the then Minister, Deputy Bruton. I was given to understand there would be a stand-alone penalty. What this states is that there will be a delay in payment. Given the fact there is leeway for construction inflation we must wonder whether there is any real pressure on National Broadband Ireland and the contractors to expedite this any quicker. If there is room for manoeuvre on construction inflation and they get paid as they complete the works-----</p>

          <p eId="para_505"> No. 1330 B is from Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy chief executive officer of the National Transport Authority, NTA. It is dated 28 June. It provides information requested by the committee on the draft greater Dublin transport strategy for 2022 to 2042. The correspondence states that following the Minister's consideration of the draft strategy a copy will be provided to the committee. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.

          <p eId="para_506">I attended a meeting of the transport committee last week because it was dealing with this specific matter. It had been furnished with a copy of the draft strategy. Its role as part of the consultation process was to discuss it. The NTA was at the meeting. We know how important this is and how important it is if a project is not included. I will give an example from my constituency. The DART+ project is to go to Maynooth. In actual fact it includes railway sheds. There are eight railway sheds to be constructed 350 m from the station in Kilcock. The train line will not go as far as Kilcock. The DART will go to Kilcock but people will not be able to get on a train there. The reason the NTA cannot amend the railway order is because Kilcock was not included in the previous project. There will have to be a separate process so that the current process will not be challenged. It shows the importance of having projects in the plan that make sense. I would have thought that wider involvement in the consultation process rather than restricted involvement would have been the way to go. Given that the strategy covers the period from 2022 to 2042, there is a value in making sure the plan is correct in the first instance and that we do not leave out very obvious measures that should be included.</p>

You start wondering whether consultations are a box-ticking exercise or a meaningful engagement. I would have thought, for example, that Deputy Carthy knows Cavan-Monaghan and the Chair knows Laois better than I would. It is the same situation for people who are in the greater Dublin area.

          <p eId="para_526">Okay. That will be for next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> The next item is C, which is correspondence from private individuals. Item 1343 is for myself. It has been dated 5 July 2022. It is a request that we make inquiries with the HSE regarding the expenditure on Erkina House, Rathdowney. This follows on from the consideration of an issue raised by Deputy Hourigan last week and our agreement to hold an engagement with the HSE in relation to mental health and expenditure in the community health organisations, CHOs, 4 and 8. This information will help inform that meeting. Is it agreed to request that? </p>
          <p eId="para_528"> The background to this is that the HSE had decided to close the facility. Very few people seemed to know anything about it, including the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. The Minister of State confirmed on the floor of the House that she was consulted about it and that it required her say-so before it could be closed. There have been significant improvements made to that development. There are 12 very vulnerable people who are living there. It is a great facility in the town of Rathdowny, in south County Laois. The HSE said that they have four such units in Laois-Offaly. If one is going to put two in Laois and two in Offaly, this facility is in the centre of the south of the county and is therefore ideally located. It is on a fabulous site with fantastic gardens. An examination of the site is being undertaken at the moment by the HSE. A relevant point is that we want to try to get a figure for the spend on that building in recent times in order to see how it works. I know that a huge re-roofing was job done in the past year on the building. The building would seem to me to be in good shape. It is a similar situation in some ways to the Owenacurra Centre. This building is certainly a substantial structure and is in good condition. It is important from the committee's point of view that we find out what has been spent to date on it. Is that agreed? </p>

          <p eId="para_530">Thank you. The final item of correspondence is 1338C, which is dated 23 June 2022. It concerns the wards of court fund. It requests that the committee examine the issue. The correspondence states that there have been substantial losses to the fund and that there is a lack of proper State oversight of the fund, which is in excess of €2 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> While the Committee of Public Accounts as of the 31st Dáil, published a report in July 2015, on the wards of court fund, the Committee of Public Accounts of the 32nd Dáil considered the matter. It decided that it was more appropriate that it was under the remit of the then committee on justice and equality and closed its consideration of the matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_532"> The difficulty is that the fund is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Therefore, it does not fall within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts. In September 2020, this committee also considered correspondence on the matter. It referred related correspondence that was received from the Department of Justice and from the Courts Service to the correspondent. It advised that its consideration of the matter was closed. It is proposed that we advise the correspondent that it remains the case that matter is most appropriate to the remit of the Joint Committee on Justice, particularly because the fund is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The correspondent also states that in 2010, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, assured the Justice for Wards group that legislation was being drafted to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to have oversight of these funds. Matters of legislation are also for that committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> To try to assist the correspondent, I would suggest that we clarify the position and that we advise that we might wish to bring the matter to the attention of the justice committee. Does any member wish to comment on that item of correspondence? </p>

          <p eId="para_534">First, I thank the correspondent for again bringing these important matters to the attention of the committee. There is a role for this committee, insofar as commitments have been given that the Comptroller and Auditor General would have oversight of what I understand to be more than €2.2 billion in expenditure that the State holds for wards of this nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> Could the Comptroller and Auditor General could give an update as to whether or not there has been any interaction with his office in respect of this happening? If it has not, I think we should write to the relevant Department, which I understand to be the Department of Justice, to ask if that is still the intention and, if so, the timeframe for same.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> We should inform the correspondent of that, as well as the points that the Chair has mentioned. There is also reference to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill. It highlights some problems there. I understand that Bill is under the remit of health, as opposed to justice. In that vein, perhaps it would be useful if we could also send this correspondence to the health committee, in order to make it aware. It is my understanding that that legislation has gone through the Dáil and is now before the Seanad. However, perhaps the health committee might appreciate this correspondence. </p>

The first engagement will be on the mental health services in community healthcare organisations, CHOs, 4 and 8. The second engagement will be on emergency services.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> Before opening the floor to Members, in terms of our schedule for September and early October, I propose the following: that we consider using our first meeting back to deal with correspondence and any other business, bearing in mind that when we come back, it will be on a Wednesday afternoon and we will have a packed meeting the following morning. Given what has happened in previous years, following the summer period a substantial amount of stuff will need to be dealt with. It may happen that something urgent pops up over the summer period that the committee may have to come together to make a decision on. If that happens we will try to manage that. I just wish to flag that. Is it agreed we use our first meeting in that way?</p>

          <p eId="para_561">It is not a special report on broadband but a chapter, so there will be the usual annual report with a number of chapters in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> In terms of special reports, the one that is closest to completion is the one on the purchase of ventilators. I expect that one will be available in the autumn. There is also the triennial progress report on the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA. Again, that one is coming to completion. There are a number of others in the works but they are not at a stage where they would be ready for the autumn.</p>

          <p eId="para_570">I remind the committee that it talked an engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in enough time to influence this year's appropriation accounts circular, the one for 2022. I think there were a number of things, specifically relating to the pay note in appropriation accounts, where suggestions were made as to things that could be looked at. In the engagement with the Accounting Officer when he was here, I think the Deputy asked for the Department to come back with proposals. It might be useful to engage earlier on, let us say in October, on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">I found that engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform one of the most frustrating sessions we have had here. I am not sure we got a whole lot out of it. I was questioning at the end of it what the purpose was of the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">When we are dealing with the expenditure on emergency services, I suggest we raise the issue of the National Ambulance Service with the witnesses because the two issues cannot be separated. There are real problems with the efficiency of services if ambulances are backed up outside of accident and emergency units, with patients in the ambulances for hours. That situation causes problems with how emergency services at hospitals function.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> We will have an engagement with the HSE on expenditure on mental health-related services in CHO 4 and CHO 8, and a further engagement to examine its 2021 financial statements, highlighting expenditure on emergency services as an area of particular interest to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> At this point we will not go much further. I suggest we pencil the HSE in somewhere because we have found the HSE is such a big gig, it is very hard to dig into the detail, and I think the committee is at one on this. I have spoken to a few members privately on it, and some of them have raised it with me, that there is a specific piece of work to be done on HSE estates, its properties, sites and what is and is not in use. The HSE is a big outfit and potentially there are a lot of loose ends there. Perhaps the committee would consider that.</p>

          <p eId="para_584">Absolutely. That meeting could go be taken somewhat like this morning's session, where much of it was taken up with school estates. That whole meeting could have been around that as opposed to just 80%. We need 100% with the HSE because given the scale of the HSE-----</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-07-07T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_585">I completely accept that and I think it is very valuable to do this. However, there has only been one facility where attention has been drawn in CHO 8. I am presuming there is more. We want to just see if there is a comparison between how the two CHOs handle things, as much as looking at the issue to see whether it is different across the HSE.</p>

          <p eId="para_587">It seems that the starting point is what the strategy is in relation to the kinds of services that are wanted delivered. After that, it seems there are targets in relation to the level of provision that will be provided for populations. If you like, for example, one could take a population area in CHO 4 or CHO 8, look at what the total objective or strategy for that area and population, and then look at what is in place, the quality of it, the utilisation of it and the plans going forward.

          <p eId="para_592">Yes. It is how we get to see how they are managing what there is, whether it is effectively managed and whether there is waste, which is an issue. We are looking at waste but also talking about delivery of a service.</p>

          <p eId="para_593">An awful lot of those kinds of services are done with what is called a spatial analysis. There is a map that shows where people are living, which comes out of the census, and it can then be overlaid on that where the services are delivered and whether the two things are matched up. Catchment areas can also be designed around individual facilities and see whether there a match. For example, in one facility there might be eight beds for a particular population and another facility serving a bigger population might have 16 beds. That partially answers the kind of-----</p>

          <p eId="para_594">What they want can change from time to time. I know from the most recent meeting we had with HSE management that at the present time, a ten- to 12-bed unit is what seems to be the optimum in terms of what works.</p>

          <p eId="para_596">There is also suitability of locations. Obviously, if these facilities are put on the side of a busy road where there are no shops, it is an issue, because people who are somehow independent and will go to a local shop if it is close by may be stuck out in the suburbs somewhere, so there is all of that to consider. I suggest from this discussion, if it is agreed, that we hold a meeting on HSE estates and mental health facilities in those two areas. That might be the way forward. We will leave it at that. However, if we need to tweak that a bit, we can, but just for now we will go with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> Members will be aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General’s Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021 will be available at the end of September. They might want to prioritise further areas of examination once we have sight of that. We will see how we go with that, but we need to pencil something in to start off with. The secretariat and guests as well, in fairness to them, need a month to prepare. We need to be looking kind of six weeks out. We need to have an idea of where we are going six or seven weeks out. That has worked well over this year, if members are happy enough with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> Are there any other matters that members wish to raise in relation to our programme? No. That concludes the consideration of our programme for today. The last item on the public agenda today is any other business. Are there any other matters that members wish to raise? No. The meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts stands adjourned until 14 July, when we will engage with An Bord Pleanála.</p>
