            <p eId="para_2">This is to ask the Minister for an update on the reform of the junior cycle, particularly in light of the fact that a teachers' strike is imminent on 2 December.</p>

          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">I have met with the teacher unions five times since my appointment as Minister. Three of these meetings were solely to deal with issues relating to implementation of reforms to the junior cycle. I agreed to Dr. Pauric Travers chairing negotiations between the Department and the unions, and I also agreed to both the timeframe and terms of reference for those talks which were proposed by the unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> On 10 November, I presented a compromise proposal that included a State certificate for all students on completion of the junior cycle; final examinations in third year to account for 60% of junior cycle marks, to be set and marked by the State Examinations Commission, SEC, and 40% relating to other components to be assessed by classroom teachers within agreed criteria - for this 40%, the State Examinations Commission would check 10% to 15 % of the marks to ensure consistency and fairness; and well-being to become a compulsory element of junior cycle, including SPHE, PE and CSPE.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> I thank Deputy McConalogue for his support for my position, which I believe represents a reasonable compromise relating to the implementation of these reforms. The unions did not accept this proposal but acknowledged that it was significant. At a meeting on 19 November between myself and the unions, there was again little movement by the unions. The teacher unions have decided to strike on 2 December, with a further event being proposed for January. I have said publicly, and will repeat again here today, that this is disappointing, and I believe it to be a disproportionate response to the compromise proposals which remain on the table.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> I urge both unions to reconsider their position and re-engage in talks rather than proceeding with a strike that serves no one's interests.</p>

            <p eId="para_7">I thank the Minister for her response. I welcomed the Minister's row-back on the need for the junior certificate to continue to be a State certified examination and for 60% of the final examination to be externally assessed. I had been calling for that for more than two years, as had others, but the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, was not in listening mode throughout the three years in which he held the post the Minister now holds. Unfortunately, the situation we now find ourselves in is that the document and what the Minister has announced, which is rowing back the position the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, had adopted, goes back to the original proposals put together by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, which were on the table even before the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, came to office. That has been the contributing factor to us finding ourselves in strike action, having previously been in a situation where there was industrial dispute.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">The Minister's position is that she will only talk to them if they accept at the outset that there will be 60% outside assessment and 40% inside assessment. That is a barrier to real negotiations and getting down to the nitty-gritty, which can lead to a resolution. Will the Minister go back to the talks, do a real assessment of the remaining issues, and try to come to an agreement which will see a reformed and enhanced junior certificate programme?</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">I thank the Deputy. I have listened to the concerns I have heard since I became Minister. I have had a number of meetings with all the interests involved. That is the reason I put the proposal on the table. One could say I have moved 60% from the position originally balloted on. Significantly, and the Deputy referred to it, the certificate will now be a State certificate, fully certified by the State Examinations Commission. It will not be 60% certified but 100% certified, including the school-based assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> Negotiation involves movement on both sides. We had Dr. Travers chairing discussions. I have moved, but I need to see some movement on the other side. My door is open. I am willing to engage again, but there has to be some response in terms of the central principle that assessment within the schools with class teachers involved must be part of the reform. Otherwise, we will not achieve many of the goals we want to achieve in this reform process.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_10">
            <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">The Minister's response to the decision of teachers to strike, and I have called on teachers to call off the strike and engage with her, also requires her leaving the door properly ajar for discussions with them. Rather than being a progression, the Minister's U-turn, which brings us back to where we started, and her corresponding stance that any talks are dependent on the unions agreeing to 40% of the final examination being internally assessed, to which the teachers have a principled objection, makes those talks impractical in the sense that it has put teachers in the position where they have not been able to engage with her. For this issue to progress, the Minister must sit down and tease out the genuine concerns to allow a final agreement be reached, which will see a reformed curriculum put in place that is workable and will greatly improve the way students engage and learn at junior certificate level. I urge the Minister to do that because striking is unnecessary, and I believe the approach taken by the Minister has led to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_16">I am willing to talk to the teachers but they have told me that they object in principle to school-based assessment, and school-based assessment is part of the proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">If they are not willing to come back to the table and engage in any way in respect of school-based assessment with participation by class teachers, then they have not moved at all. As I said already, in any negotiation there must be movement on both sides. The movement I have put on the table represents a considerable change from what was balloted on by the members of the two unions concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">It is a similar question. To move the process on a little, I am keen to know what steps will be put in place to try to resolve it, as opposed to getting an update.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">I am afraid my initial answer is somewhat similar. Since September I have been engaging with the teacher unions in respect of the reform of the junior cycle. I have met the union leaders many times, as have my officials. Dr. Pauric Travers has chaired the meetings. We met trade union representatives over three days to negotiate the reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> I tabled a compromise proposal on 10 November to unblock the obstacles identified by the unions. When I met the unions on 19 November, they acknowledged that the proposal was significant but were not willing to move from their position. I asked them to reconsider their decision to strike and I regret that they will take strike action on 2 December.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> I have told the unions that my door is open. I am willing to discuss the resources required to support the implementation of these reforms, but any discussion about resources must be underpinned by agreement on the reforms that need to be resourced. Since my appointment I have sought genuine engagement with all education partners, including parents, students, management bodies and teacher unions. I genuinely believe that the compromise proposals which I tabled on 10 November offer a reasonable solution to the dispute and I call on the unions again to reconsider their position and re-engage in talks rather than proceeding with a strike that serves no one's interests.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">There are several issues. I imagine all sides would agree that most of the issues could be resolved, but the main outstanding issue is internal assessment and that is the real block in progress in the discussions. Will the Minister outline the rationale for the internal ongoing assessment? What is the educational principle underpinning this move by the Department? Will the Minister explain it to us? The Department maintains this is based on an assessment for learning. Will the Minister elaborate on that?</p>

            <p eId="para_24">Several schools are already implementing a school-based assessment with class teachers involved. Deputy O'Brien will be aware that at least one of these schools is in his constituency. This is part of the proposal because it represents a genuine engagement in learning between the teachers and their students as well as the other teachers in the school. The idea is that there is feedback and a learning process within that experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> We have information from other countries and considerable research data suggesting that this is good for students. It is particularly good for disaffected students, young people who switch off from school, particularly in disadvantaged areas. This occurs frequently in the early years of post-primary education. We are keen to re-engage those students. The information we have suggests that this type of interaction with teachers is particularly effective in the learning experience of students who are likely to drop out or who are likely not to do well in State examinations. That is the rationale behind it.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> There is extensive guidance on how projects, etc., should be marked. The State Examinations Commission is involved and is willing to stand over this 100%. Deputy O'Brien is probably right: we need to explain a little better why we are proposing this and the rationale for the school-based assessment as well as explaining the evidence that this produces real learning and engagement. It is the kind of thing that happens in post-primary education and post-leaving certificate courses. It is done already by members of one of the unions involved at least. Deputy O'Brien is probably right. We need to explain it.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">As the Minister stated, the assessment for learning is all about providing feedback to students and guidance. I reckon much of that happens in the current context. As parents we get feedback on our children through parent-teacher meetings and Christmas and Easter examinations. Students get feedback in one-on-one meetings with teachers, through career guidance and so on. What is happening here is that we are moving from an assessment for learning to an assessment of learning. I believe that is the wrong way to go.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> The Minister referred to research. One could produce research to argue from the teacher position as well. Let us consider all the countries that have internal assessment in place currently. I have in mind Australia or Netherlands, which has the mix that the Minister is proposing. There is no empirical evidence to suggest that such a model improves educational outputs. I am keen to see the evidence the Minister is using. Will the Minister put that on the table? Will she show the Opposition spokespersons that what she is proposing is backed up by empirical evidence and that there will be an improvement in educational outcomes?</p>

            <p eId="para_29">Certainly, we have evidence and I am absolutely willing to give Deputy O'Brien whatever we have in that regard. We have a considerable amount of evidence. It is important to note that these proposals of assessment within the school, involving school classroom teachers with their students, is supported by the Irish Second-Level Students Union, parents councils and management bodies, etc. There has been extensive consultation with all of the partners in education and with a considerable number of people who are already operating the proposals within the school system.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> I believe it is entirely disproportionate to take all the children out of school on 2 December rather than come back and negotiate meaningfully in respect of the significant shift that I have made. The most important element is that the State Examinations Commission, which is entirely trusted, as far as I can see, is willing to fully stand over the junior cycle certificate that will be given at the end of the three-year cycle.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">Will the Minister for Education and Skills support the integrity of the junior certificate for students by retaining the principle of having externally examiners grade the examinations? I welcome the debate because we need a detailed debate in this area. The bottom line is that the Government wants the abolition of an independent State assessment. School-based assessments with teachers grading their pupils in State examinations will not work because it leaves out one major factor. The role of the teacher is to support, nurture and develop the pupil. They have a different and rather special relationship. This important aspect has been missing in the debate.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">Let me be absolutely clear: the integrity of the existing junior certificate will be maintained and improved by my proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> It is essential that students are marked by their teachers to promote better student learning and improved student outcomes. School-based assessment empowers teachers to support the unique talents and skills of the students in their classrooms. It allows for a far more rounded picture of student achievement to emerge. What is assessed is valued; school-based assessment promotes a learning culture in schools which recognises and rewards skills that cannot readily be externally assessed. This, in turn, improves the validity and integrity of the assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> Parents and teachers have raised concerns with me about school-based certificates and I am happy to address those concerns by retaining the State certificate. However, State certification is not only about putting the harp on a certificate. It will be underpinned by the assurance that the procedures leading to the award are robust, including the school-based element.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> The unions are questioning how standards will be maintained. The combination of a 60% examination set and marked by the SEC, combined with quality assurance by the SEC on the school-based elements, has allowed me to be confident about issuing State certificates. This reform is not about protecting systems; it is about improving standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">The bottom line is that an independent outside examiner does not know where the pupil comes from. He does not whether the pupil is rich or poor, male or female. He is coming at it objectively. Teachers have led the charge for reform. School assessment and project work goes on every day in every school in Ireland. The Minister referred to the rationale and children dropping out of school. I worked in a disadvantaged school.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">The best way to keep pupils in the system is to work, nurture and develop them, and build on the relationship. Seán O'Broin, as the principal of Kinsale Community School, saw his students reach great heights of achievement, particularly in the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition. He has seen the dividends of close application of hard academic slog and is a respected educationalist. He said, "Teachers correcting the school work component may jeopardise the public's trust in the integrity of the assessment." He hit the nail on the head. While everybody supports reform, the Minister must maintain the integrity of assessment. This is the issue, and parents see it coming down the line.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">Although a written exam after three years can assess certain things, which we value, it cannot assess everything. The Deputy referred to the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition. A written exam at the end of three years does not assess the kind of work we see at it. I am sure everybody here will have visited it and seen what these fantastic students are doing. They work together in groups, do project work, get lots of feedback from their teachers and produce interesting, creative projects. A written exam will not examine those achievements. If one gives no marks for something, there is pressure on schools not to spend too much time doing it. Assessments would contribute to students' marks, fully stood over by the State Examination Commission. I am not abolishing independent State assessment. I will continue to have the State independently providing these certificates. If one does not give some value to the ongoing assessment and the feedback involved, it has no value at the end of the year, there is pressure on the schools to spend less time doing these important things. Higher education lecturers value those skills when students come to third level. They want secondary students to get the opportunity to have these skills valued.</p>

            <p eId="para_40">The Minister is a great woman for distracting us. She is misrepresenting most teachers and educationalists. The teachers support a move away from reliance on a terminal exam, and we all support that principle. The problem is the actual assessment. Take a small school in a village or parish. What about the parents who make their presence felt every day in the primary schools and micro-manage every aspect of their children’s lives from their social lives to who they sit beside at school? Some of us would call them pushy parents. Imagine the pressure on the local teacher if such a parent does not like the junior certificate result his or her child gets. Imagine the pressure on the teacher going to the shops or across the community. The Minister is missing out on a very important aspect, independent assessment where no parent can accuse a teacher of giving a preferential mark to his or her own child. This must be examined closely. It is a major problem in wider society. Pushy parents are out there. The Minister and I both know them. They come in and tell people what to do left, right and centre, and they could be a problem in the assessments.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I announced the 2014-2015 minor works grant on 25 November. The grant, amounting to €28 million in total, will issue over the coming weeks to all primary schools with permanent recognition. Funding under the grant will continue at existing levels with schools receiving a basic grant of €5,500 plus €18.50 per mainstream pupil and €74 per special needs pupil on the rolls on 30 September of the year prior to the issue of the grant, which, in this instance, is 2013. The funds being transferred to the schools must be spent on the physical infrastructure of the schools or on items of furniture and equipment for educational use, including IT related equipment. The minor works grant is an important funding injection for primary schools and I am pleased to be able to provide it this year. I know the funding is put to very effective use by schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">I very much welcome that the minor works grant will be paid this year. Many schools are waiting for funds and finding it very difficult to pay their bills and are existing on overdrafts. Unfortunately, no clarity was given to the schools throughout this year as to whether this very important grant would be paid to them. The first time they had any certainty that it would be paid was when the Minister, thankfully, made the decision in the past few days to pay it. As the Minister pointed out, it is worth €5,500 to any school, and €7,500 to the average school. We welcome the fact that it is being paid. As the Minister did not allocate money in her budget for it, she is taking it from the capital budget. Could she detail the implications of taking it from the capital budget? From where, exactly, will it come and what projects will miss out as a result of it? Last year, when this announcement was made, a summer works scheme of €40 million was also announced. Will there be no summer works scheme next year?</p>

            <p eId="para_51">November has been generally the time the minor works grant has been announced, in the past two years when there was one. There was no minor works grant in 2012-2013. The grant is issued by the building unit, and is not in the annual calendar of grants circulated by the central funds section. The money is found in the building unit. With a very large capital programme, money that one thought would be spent in 2014 might not be spent until 2015. We have been able to find the money in the capital allocation and it will not stop any projects happening in terms of school buildings and replacement of prefabs.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">I do not accept the Minister’s answer. The fact that she has taken €28 million from the capital budget means many schools that are ready to go with their building works and whose building works are in progress are being stalled into next year to provide the money. This is not money that the Minister finds, nor was it before the Government came into office. It was normally allocated in advance in the budget so that schools were told they were to get it. It was always in the primary grants calendar because the money was specifically allocated for it in the budget. Only under the Minister and her predecessor has it been the case. They scramble around to see if they can find money from other sources, namely, by stalling school projects. The Minister should not try to tell us that taking €28 million out of the capital budget will have no impact on schools. This is not reality. Capital projects will miss out as a result. Fianna Fáil is the only party that has put money in its pre-budget submission to provide a capital works grant next year. The Minister has not done it, and this time next year she will be scrabbling around to see if she can take it from somewhere else.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> Will there be a summer works scheme next year? Last year, when local elections were held, the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, managed to find €40 million for that scheme from the capital budget. Clearly the Minister cannot find that sum this year, so I take it that there will be no summer works scheme for primary schools in 2015.</p>

            <p eId="para_55"> As the Deputy knows, the five-year schools buildings programme finishes next year and we are now working on the next programme. Many schools did not get into that five-year programme and they are almost ready to go now. I am aware of many of them around the country and since becoming Minister, I have met with people concerning those schools. Early next year, I will be announcing the next programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> At the moment there is no allocation for the summer works scheme. I do not know at this stage whether or not there will be extra capital, but at this stage there is not. I am being straight up on that. For the last three years, the minor works scheme has been announced in November, so that is the practice I am following this year. I am pleased that I am able to announce it.</p>

My Department is currently working to develop this model and to assess the impact of the new model on schools and on children. I have asked my officials to report on whether, and from when, this new model could be brought into place.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> In the meantime, pupils with Down's syndrome will continue to receive resource teaching support from teachers allocated to schools either through the general allocation model or by the NCSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">I thank the Minister for her reply. She has confirmed that there will be additional resources for children with disabilities, for example, in 2015. However, there has to be some level of stability and guarantee for all children with disability so that when they attend their local primary school, resources will be put in place for them. It has been proven internationally that such pupils thrive educationally in these situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> Now that the foot is off cutbacks in resources, we need to keep the focus on such services. Many of these services have been cut over the last four or five years. Huge hits have meant that the Minister was unable to deal with class sizes, which is an important issue when one is working with children with disabilities in mainstream classes. Our primary classes are still the second largest in the EU, so we need to examine that in next year's budget. </p>

            <p eId="para_64">I acknowledge that Deputy McGrath has campaigned for a long time for, and has taken a particular interest in, children with special educational needs, including those with Down's syndrome. As he indicated, I was able to announce extra resource teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, in the recent budget. They will be provided for schools during the coming year.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> The NCSE has presented proposals on changing the model and I am sure the Deputy has had a chance to examine them. This is in line with what the Deputy said about having resources in schools when the children come in, rather than having a diagnosis. In terms of Down's syndrome that is not terribly difficult, but other conditions can be quite difficult to diagnose. In some cases, parents spend money they cannot afford in order to obtain a diagnosis. We therefore want to change the system around.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> The consultation process is ongoing in this regard. I expect to get some information back on that consultation quite soon through the NCSE. The question is whether we will be able to implement the proposals for the next school year or whether it might be later. Much of that will depend on what happens in the consultation process and the effect the change would have on schools. Essentially, we want to provide for need rather than providing to schools simply on the basis of previous models that were used, particularly the medical diagnosis model.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">I acknowledge that the Minister was very positive in the budget in providing for extra SNAs, teachers and other resources in the primary school sector. I support that major step in the right direction. We need to radically reform our education system constantly to ensure that it is inclusive. There is a broad range of pupils' needs across the disability sector, including more urgent cases than children with Down's syndrome. I take the Minister's point but they need well planned supports to be in place from September to June.</p>

            <p eId="para_71">My Department, in conjunction with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, has initiated a major reform of the primary curriculum. This reform will examine the entire curriculum, including its structure and content, to identify areas where revisions or updates are required. One of the aims of this reform is to ensure that the primary curriculum is appropriately structured to provide pupils with the necessary knowledge, skills and dispositions for positive educational outcomes without overburdening them or their teachers. Priority has been given to developing a new integrated language curriculum and a new mathematics curriculum, as these are core priorities identified in the national literacy and numeracy strategy. The wider primary curriculum review will be initiated in 2015 with a public consultation process. This will provide all stakeholders with an opportunity to outline their views on the existing curriculum and their priorities for the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_72">I welcome that review, including the public consultation process. In recent years, many different organisations and groups have been putting pressure on schools to implement their programmes. Some of these programmes are excellent, including ones for health, child safety and smoking. Special programmes deal with such issues in the primary school curriculum every day but many teachers tell me they find it difficult to fit such programmes into a daily timetable from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> I accept the Minister's point that she is putting a strong emphasis on languages and mathematics, which are important for the country's future development. To go back to the overload, however, teachers are worried that so much responsibility will be put on them that they will not be able to deliver serious aspects of the primary school curriculum.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">The current curriculum dates back to 1999, so it is time to review it. However, excellent work is going on in primary schools. I have had an opportunity to visit a number of them in recent days and I saw the great dedication of primary school teachers there. I was in a school in Swords in north County Dublin the other day which was receiving a digital schools of distinction award. I have been to a couple of such award ceremonies. It is great to see how they incorporate IT and use new methodologies to strengthen the way in which they teach core subjects like literacy and numeracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> However, as the Deputy said, there are many pressures.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">People say this, that and the other should be done in primary schools but the important thing is that the curriculum is child-centred and focuses on basic skills like maths and literacy. We must ensure the experience is positive for children. This, essentially, is why the curriculum is being reviewed and why we are having consultations on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">On reform and dealing with the overload, when we move away from austerity I want to see an end to the moratorium on promotions in schools as this will improve leadership. Teaching principals should have greater release time as this would be valuable in assisting the development of class teachers. Teaching principals perform the roles of teacher, administrator, social worker, security person and, in some disadvantaged schools, bouncer. My point is, overload in this area must be examined now that the economy is seeing better times.</p>

            <p eId="para_78">I also welcome the review of the curriculum. While the curriculum has not changed since 1999, some of the teaching methods have changed and this has been very positive. One of the best aspects of this is that we can now identify students with learning difficulties at an earlier age due to changes in the curriculum and how it is taught. Any review should take account of this but it also presents challenges because the recognition of learning difficulties at an earlier age creates the need for resources. My comments complement what the Minister said on the previous question regarding the new model.</p>

            <p eId="para_79">On Deputy McGrath's point, my meetings with the Irish Primary Principals' Network, IPPN, and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, have underlined the stressful jobs that principals face. We have worked hard on the recovery of the economy and I hope there will be an education dividend. I will fight strongly for extra resources in the education sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> On Deputy O'Brien's point, Aistear, the curriculum for children in the range from zero to six years that is used in pre-school and early-years primary school, has brought about significant changes. I compliment teachers because they have been very responsive in adapting to the needs of all children, particularly those with learning difficulties. Primary schools are very inclusive in involving children who may have greater difficulty learning than their peers.</p>

            <p eId="para_93">That was short and sweet. I agree that we must prioritise capitation grants but we must also catch up, given the hits taken by the education sector, particularly primary education, in recent years. The overall hit is 15%. I ask the Minister to focus on three aspects: class sizes, resources for children with disabilities and targeting disadvantage in early education. It has been proved that early intervention works. When I worked in education years ago the Breaking the Cycle programme was initiated by the Minister's former colleague, Ms Niamh Bhreathnach. Huge work was done for schools in disadvantaged areas and the focus was on young children so they would not be lost in the system later. The target must be on educational disadvantage and children with special needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">On educational disadvantage, we are reviewing the DEIS programme as it has existed for some years. DEIS has done great work but it is time for it to be examined to ensure every element has positive results. Some schools did not qualify for DEIS, particularly schools that did not exist when it was initiated, so the area must be addressed. When I was in Deputy McGrath's position as an Opposition spokesperson I took a strong interest in educational disadvantage and this is an area I will address as Minister.</p>

There are many talented young teachers with great IT skills and a huge number of children are computer literate so the country has a great future in this regard.

Speeds are slower in other schools and I acknowledge this. As I said, the strategy will be published shortly. I have seen wonderful things in primary schools; some children can write computer programmes using Scratch, a method of making films and the like. This is all very well when schools have high-speed broadband so we want to roll out the service - it will be fully rolled-out for post-primary schools by the end of this year.</p>

Looking at the plan of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, it is clear that many primary schools will be waiting until 2020 to receive any serious level of broadband connectivity. Unless we see a serious strategy over and above what he proposes, we will see primary schools unable to avail of the educational opportunities that would be there with broadband.</p>

Has any progress been made to move from a paper-based system in schools to tablets? Some schools are very innovative in regard to that. This matter is more important than broadband as the software can be downloaded onto the tablets in advance of class. The great advantage of tablets is that an academically very bright pupil can proceed ahead in class because the technology allows that. Children who are a bit slower can have the advantage of going at a slower pace rather than to have everyone in the class working at a uniform rate. It can be a huge advantage as a tool for teachers as tablets can facilitate children progressing at different paces. Has the Department made a definitive decision to progress the roll-out of tablets as an education and teaching aid?</p>

            <p eId="para_108">I wish to advise Deputy Charlie McConalogue that I will meet the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, in the next week or two to engage on these issues. Approximately 3.5% of primary schools are still on connections of less than 2 MB, of which approximately half are awaiting the installation of improved services of 8 MB or higher. The other half are the subject of current tenders under the framework. More than 80% of primary school projects will be put out to tender in the first half of 2015 as their current contracts expire. It is expected that this will lead to improved services. We are moving on this albeit I acknowledge that there are schools, particularly in isolated areas and certain parts of the country, where speeds are not as good as they should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_109"> I note to Deputy Naughten that I would be very encouraging of schools, but we must give them the high speed connections and the resources. We are doing that. I acknowledge that progress has been much better at post-primary level than primary, but it is probably the right approach to ensure that all post-primary schools have high-speed connections as a priority. We are moving in the other area and I have seen examples where school websites are used to communicate with parents and there has been a reduction in paper-based activity. Some schools are doing what Deputy Naughten suggests we should do in all of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> In an earlier response, I said we hoped to have more resources with the recovery. We have extra funding in education for the first time this year and I intend to ensure that we get more next year. The area referred to by Deputy Naughten will certainly be given attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_112">Approximately one in six children misses more than 20 days in school each year. We continue to have a significant problem with truancy. Under the law currently, a parent is not legally entitled to receive child benefit unless the child beneficiary is attending school. I want a tie-up between the Minister's Department and the Department of Social Protection whereby we could threaten to suspend child benefit payments where a child does not attend school. It is a far better use of resources than to tie up the National Educational Welfare Board and the courts in prosecuting parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_113">I am happy to have my Department facilitate any request from the Department of Social Protection for data sharing to ensure the effective delivery of public services in a manner which is fully compliant with the requirements of the Data Protection Acts. Earlier this year, my officials met with the Department of Social Protection to explore how data on enrolments could be used for verification purposes in respect of social welfare payments, including for example continued payment of child benefit where children over 16 remain in full-time education. My officials are due to meet further with the Department of Social Protection on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_114"> I note that Deputy Naughten's specific concern is to use this process to address issues about children not going to school. I take that point and will respond further in reply to supplementary questions.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">I thank the Minister for her response and I am glad to see that officials from the two Departments are now meeting. That is all well and good in regard to children who are over the age of 16. However, school principals nationally must fill out and return 600,000 letters on a quarterly basis to be issued by the Department of Social Protection to parents asking them to verify that a son or daughter is still within the education system. Would it not make far better sense to use the available technology on school enrolment and the reporting mechanism to the National Educational Welfare Board, or NEWB, where a child misses 20 days from school? Where that could be linked up with the Department of Social Protection, it would eradicate the need to fill out 600,000 letters which constitute enough paper to cover the pitch at Croke Park two and a half times.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">Our officials will meet with those of the Department of Social Protection in the near future. Educational Welfare Services, which was formerly known as NEWB, is the statutory body for school attendance and is under the remit of Tusla, which is in turn a body within the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. We are talking therefore about three Departments and perhaps need to engage with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs also. The failure of children to attend school is something the Government feels very strongly about across Departments. We must ensure that there is an effective mechanism to prevent children being deprived of their educational opportunities. My Department is willing to do everything possible in terms of data sharing to ensure that we have an effective system in that regard. I am willing to ensure that the matter is raised in discussions with officials from other Departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_117">I thank the Minister for her response. She has hit the nail on the head. The problem is that three Departments are involved - her own Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Social Protection. Everyone is passing the buck and saying it is an issue for someone else. The fact is that one in six children in our schools is missing more than 20 days a year and some Minister will have to take a leadership role in relation to that. I urge the Minister to take the lead in relation to this. We can make a significant impact on the issue of truancy in the State by linking up the information collected by the Departments of Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs, and Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_118"> All we ask is that the law is enforced and that where parents fail to send their children to school, they are threatened with the suspension of child benefit payments. That is better than to drag them through the courts and ending up in a situation where children lose a year of school before orders can be made to force parents to return their children to the education system.</p>

            <p eId="para_123"> These resources have been protected, or in some areas increased, despite requirements to make expenditure savings in other areas. As part of budget 2015, I recently announced that an additional 365 special needs assistant, SNA, posts would be provided in 2015, as well as an additional 480 resource teachers, to take into account increased demand and demographic growth and to ensure that children can continue to have access to additional supports in school.

            <p eId="para_126">There are 130 new special classes coming on stream and the extra SNAs and resource teachers as I have indicated. The NCSE is consulting on a new model of allocation to ensure that the resources are in the school when the child arrives rather than the parents having to in some cases pay for a diagnosis and wait for the supports to be put in place. We want to ensure that the child is at the centre of this, particularly the special needs child, and that we provide resources, whether in the mainstream class or a special class attached to a mainstream school or, in a small number of cases, in special schools. We have allocated extra resources for this and we will look to provide a more child-centred model.</p>

One area the NCSE is looking to address is to get a sense of the kind of need in a particular area so that schools will be given the resources in accordance with that. It is looking for background data, for example, from the Health Service Executive, HSE, early childhood services where there would be evidence of children with special needs about to go to school who will need certain services. The council will co-ordinate that information to ensure the services are there for the children.</p>

            <p eId="para_131">All special schools receive enhanced pupil teacher ratios ranging from 6:1, to 12:1, depending on the disability categorisation of pupils attending. These enhanced ratios are provided because pupils attending special schools have very significant special educational needs. Special schools also receive very high levels of special educational needs assistant staffing support.</p>
            <p eId="para_132"> It is not appropriate for special schools to implement a policy of regular suspensions of pupils. Where a pupil is suspended from a school, a parent may appeal this suspension under section 29 of the Education Act 1998. Where a pupil is suspended from a school for more than six days, or is absent for an aggregate of more than 20 days in the school year, the school is obliged to notify the Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency of this absence. Advice and support is available for special schools from the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and the Special Educational Support Service.</p>

            <p eId="para_133">I posed this question in the context of a difficult case in my area involving the parents of a young man with severe problems and some behavioural issues who has been to several schools but got a place in a special school. However, because the school did not seem to be able to manage his behaviour, in the parents’ opinion, he was routinely suspended, although the school was supposed to be his place of refuge. The parents have got private applied behaviour analysis, ABA, tutoring for him and have themselves done a lot of work with him and they believe the problem is the way the school is handling him rather than any inherent difficulties in the young man. If a different approach had been adopted, perhaps the results could have been better.</p>
            <p eId="para_134"> They told me he is an intelligent man in many ways. His learning has been absolutely impacted on by the fact that on many occasions he has been suspended. The idea that it is a school for children with special needs and he has been expelled because of the difficulties arising from those needs does not make any sense. Is that a routine policy? I note what the Minister said about how they may appeal but does this not sound particularly odd in those circumstances?</p>

            <p eId="para_135">Parents would be advised to engage with the school in that situation. I presume they have done so. I need to be careful about commenting on a particular case when I do not know its circumstances. In the first instance, the parents would be advised to engage with the school principal and board of management. Under section 21 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 the school is required to notify in writing an educational welfare officer where a student is suspended from a recognised school for a period of six days or more or where the aggregate number of school days on which a student is absent from a school during a school year is 20 days or more. On receiving that notification, the educational welfare officer will make all reasonable efforts to ensure that provision is made for the continued education of the child and his or her full participation in school. The educational welfare officer should have a central role in these cases, dealing with the school and possible alternative schools. I referred to section 29 and NEPS is also available. I am not sure whether these bodies have been involved in this case.</p>

            <p eId="para_136">The good part of the answer is that suspension should not be the first port of call and should be quite unusual. That reassurance is being sought. The difficulty is that in the opinion of some professionals, which has been sought, regular suspension of a student can demonstrate to him that if he is bold he will get off school the next day which can cause problems. Other penalties such as internal suspension or taking the child out of the immediate environment but keeping him in the school environment and other milder sanctions might be better than leaving him at home with the parents struggling and making it more difficult for them to bring him to school the next day.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">It is not possible at this stage to accurately estimate the costs associated with the development of new apprenticeships. I have established the Apprenticeship Council which will make a call for proposals, hopefully before the end of this year, from enterprise sectors partnering with education and training providers for the development of new apprenticeships. The amount of financial support required will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of sustainable proposals that come in. We hope that through engagement there will be a lot of interest in this. There is a lot of talk about it and it is up to industry to get involved through the various structures and come back with proposals which will be analysed. That will give us an idea of how many proposals can be moved on to be developed as an apprenticeship model and a fair idea of the costs. As the year progresses, we will get a better idea of this but at the moment it is very hard to project. </p>
            <p eId="para_141">We are hoping through engagement that there will be a great deal of interest in this.

            <p eId="para_142">I thank the Minister of State for his answer. The review of the apprenticeship system provides us with huge opportunities. When we discussed this matter at joint committee level, we received very positive feedback from all quarters about the expansion beyond the traditional apprenticeship schemes and targeting of more women, which is also important. I suggest that the focus on secondary skills, such as literacy and numeracy, is the most important aspect of this whole issue. For too long, people who have done apprentice schemes and qualified in a particular trade have suffered as a result of the crash-boom, crash-boom economic cycle in this country. When this country has been in recession, these individuals have been out of a job. They do not have the secondary skills to step aside into a different profession. The focus that is being placed in the new scheme will be of huge benefit. I want to make sure it will be resourced adequately. I think there is huge potential here.</p>

            <p eId="para_143">I accept that the Deputy's comments are totally genuine. I think most people are supportive of what we are trying to do here. The Deputy is right. The new design and the new model will cater for that. It will make sure not only that people can build long-term careers on top of their apprenticeship qualifications, but also that much more is covered by the qualifications in the first instance. The costs should not be an issue. It should be possible to cater for numeracy and literacy issues and set the curriculums around the new proposals within the existing budget. We are within that budget at the moment. We are not yet sure of what the cost of the subsequent enterprise engagement will be. It is more than likely that such costs will not come in until towards the end of next year or early in 2016. This system is designed to ensure the other core parts of the education of these people are dealt with through the existing budgets, which are quite sustainable. As the Deputy knows, the budget in this area has been protected. Indeed, there has been a slight increase. It is an area we are focussing on. The idea is that people will not be caught out in the future by virtue of the timing of their skills. It is about having skills that are transferable. The Deputy will agree that the number of apprentices in this country is far too low. I hope this initiative will lead to an increase. I stress that we must see industry involvement here. I think the Deputy will agree with me in this regard. Companies in various sectors are telling us on a weekly basis that they need skills for the future and that they need help. There has to be engagement. Apprenticeships all over the world are based on enterprise engagement. There is a collaboration between education and enterprise. Enterprise must step up in this case.</p>

            <p eId="para_144">I concur with what the Minister of State has said. The engagement of enterprise when people are being trained is a critical cog in the success, or potential success, of this scheme. If enterprise comes on board, it will facilitate long-term planning and vision in terms of the courses we are designing. That is critical. We cannot have the system that existed in the past, when people were qualifying in trades that had gone into decline by the time they eventually qualified.</p>

I am confident that as a result of all the new reforms and structures - I refer, for example, to the apprenticeship council, SOLAS, the five-year plans and the annual service-level agreements with the education and training boards - the right system is now in place to make this happen. If enterprise is involved in planning and ongoing engagement from an early stage, as Deputy O'Brien has suggested, our predictions should be right and we should no longer be behind the curve from a skills perspective. It is likely that other initiatives will come through from the apprenticeship council model and the call for proposals. Such initiatives might be better suited to a traineeship or some other scheme. We can design and work on that. It is about trying to find out exactly what is needed. We have a fair idea from the work that is going on at the moment. We need to get in the firm proposals. If they are better suited to a different scheme, we will have to tailor them as appropriate. I hope there will be a great deal of interest in this. I hope all the players who have shown an interest in it over the last couple of months will follow through.</p>

            <p eId="para_148">I would like to ask a supplementary question on the issue of apprenticeships, which has been raised by Deputy O'Brien. In the past, one of the reasons the semi-State companies were so respected and liked was because they offered a significant number of apprenticeships. Much has been made of the comparison between the development of rural electrification by the ESB and the establishment of Irish Water. The ESB used to offer many apprenticeships. It was an important source of employment throughout County Clare, particularly in Ardnacrusha and Moneypoint. Irish Water does not really offer apprenticeships. As the ESB has become more commercial in its operations, it has not offered the same number of apprenticeships. It does not take on people unless it thinks there is an actual market there for them. Will the apprenticeship council engage with semi-States to see what training opportunities may arise? Even if the semi-State companies do not have a long-term plan to keep those who might be taken on as apprentices, they can fulfil a very important social and educational function by providing apprenticeships. If people have a City &amp; Guilds qualification, it can help them to enter the labour market in Ireland or elsewhere with a view to coming back to Ireland at a later stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_149">I am glad to confirm for the Deputy that we have spoken at length about the need to ensure the semi-State companies have a role in this initiative. I remind the House that the new chairman of the apprenticeship council comes from a semi-State body. The chief executive of the ESB is the chairman of the council. That appointment was made to ensure we have the necessary engagement in this area. As I said earlier, we want to make sure all the sectors are at the table when the council is making decisions. That will make them step up to the mark as well. In addition to advancing this initiative through the semi-State companies, we are also trying to see how we can use State contracts to address certain needs. We discussed that at a management meeting yesterday. I refer, for example, to social clauses like that which applies in the case of the Grangegorman site. A certain number of apprentices could be required. I am glad to say that the Office of Public Works started another round of apprenticeships in the last couple of months. In many of these cases, the number of places dried up in the last while. A number of new apprenticeships have been made available in the Office of Public Works. That is a key area for the development of talents. There has been a general increase in apprenticeships in all the trades. Deputy McNamara is right. We will monitor this to ensure the State bodies are involved.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcNamara" eId="spk_102">
          <from>Deputy Michael McNamara<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_153">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_154">In page 12, after line 33, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_155">"(3) The Register, including details of the owners and mortgagees of all ships but excluding such Parts as the Minister may specify in regulations, shall be open to public inspection.".</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I could argue about the extent to which amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related. Many promises were made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in advance of the last election. Some of those promises have not been realised because of ideological differences. I suppose that is reflective of the democratic mandate that was received by each party. Some of the promises have not been realised because of a lack of funds. There simply has not been enough money available to realise them. Other promises have not been realised because of sheer incompetence. One of the key promises made by both parties was to change how government is done in this country. We said we would increase openness and transparency in the operation of our government and legal systems so that people could see how laws are made in this Parliament. There was a great deal of talk about how governance structures would be changed. For example, it was suggested that backbenchers would be empowered to introduce legislation and make amendments, etc. It is in that context that I am proposing this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> One of the key provisions of this Bill, the purpose of which is to consolidate our merchant shipping legislation, is the introduction of a register of ships. I support the purpose of the Bill and the introduction of the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">However, it seems strange that the Minister is proposing the introduction of such a register – there is a public interest, given the fact that these ships carry an Irish flag no matter where they are in the world, claim Ireland as their base and submit to Irish law, including Irish employment law, the national minimum wage, etc. – without making it open to public access. The Minister’s amendment proposes that a person "shall have access to the Register in accordance with regulations made by the Minister", but he is free to make whatever regulations he wishes. For example, he could introduce restricted access to the register. Even if he introduced a statutory instrument allowing broad public access to the register, it would be left open to his successors to change that with the stroke of a pen.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> There has been a worrying legislative trend in this and previous Dáileanna to limit the power of the Dáil and to hand more power to statutory instruments or secondary legislation, which is legislation by civil servants. One imagines that, in many instances, it is a case of asking a Minister whether he or she would like a biscuit with a coffee and, by the way, here is a statutory instrument for signing. In reality, this is the level of scrutiny that the State has of statutory instruments. During the Seanad referendum, there was a great deal of discussion about how the Seanad would analyse and possibly even debate statutory instruments in great detail, but none of that has come to pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> If we are to establish a register of ships, a proposal that I support, we should be like practically every other country in the world and make it open to public inspection. What is the point in having a register if its purpose is not to be publicly accessible? That it is open to public inspection should be stated in the law establishing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> The purpose of this Bill is to set up the register and consolidate Irish merchant shipping law. In 1995, the British Government introduced similar legislation, the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. Its section 8(7) does not state that a Minister, if he or she is benevolent, may make regulations to do this or, if malevolent, may not. Rather, it unambiguously reads: "The register shall be available for public inspection." I believe the Minister supports this concept. I have raised it on Second Stage and, although I am not a member of the transport committee, on Committee Stage. From what I understand, the Minister is in favour of some degree of public access to and inspection of the register. If that is the case, is there any reason not to insert that provision in the legislation? The Minister referred to data protection sensibilities and commercial sensitivities but this provision is good enough for the UK, which has a shipping industry that is vastly larger than ours and is one of the largest in the world. It does not seem to have the same concerns about commercial sensitivities or data protection sensibilities even though it is subject to the same EU data protection laws that we are. If the UK can leave its register open to public inspection, why can we not?</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> I mentioned that there was an important public aspect to this matter. If people have an accident with a boat, they will want to know who owns it and who is the mortgagee. If people are seeking employment, they may wish to find out who their employer will be. It is not the case that this provision will only apply to a select group of people. Most Deputies would find daft the prospect of setting up a land registry that the public could not inspect. If one visited King's Inns or the Land Registry, one would find members of the public there checking out who owned what, as is their entitlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> There is a further important aspect. While there is a convention on maritime<i> liens</i>, neither Ireland nor the UK is a party to it. If mortgages registered in Ireland in accordance with the proposed register - the Bill refers explicitly to registering mortgages - are to be given effect in convention countries, whoever wishes to do so must be able to demonstrate that the register is public. I would be more concerned about the Bill's manifestations for employees and so on than I would for ships' mortgage holders, as the latter are usually under the remit of international commerce. However, it is a concern for those who own mortgages over ships registered in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> The Minister should move away from empowering legislation. He can introduce regulations. He already has that power under the Bill, and I do not propose to remove it, but he should state unambiguously that the register is open to the public in our model of open and transparent government.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">I support Deputy McNamara in his amendment. It makes eminent sense that the register would be available for public inspection. Every other asset register is open to the public, for example, the property register. By all means, if the Minister needs to introduce statutory instruments to clarify how the information is to be presented and made available, he can do so. I hope that he will support the amendment. If he cannot for some reason, I suggest an amendment to his own proposal that would go some way towards meeting Deputy McNamara's. The statutory instrument that the Minister is proposing could require the formal approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. This has been done a number of times previously. In this way, we would ensure that the detail of the statutory instrument on public availability was discussed and that a Minister seeking to amend the statutory instrument in future would have to justify the proposal before the Houses. However, the simplest and cleanest way of dealing with this issue is as has been set out by Deputy McNamara. Let the statutory instrument elaborate on how public access is to be provided. I hope that the Minister can accept the amendment.</p>

          <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_166">I thank the Deputies for their contributions. Deputy McNamara has been present on all Stages of the Bill, including by attending a meeting of a committee of which he is not a member. He has put forward and cogently argued a detailed line of thinking on this matter. He and I have been in correspondence at different points concerning how to address this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> It is important to emphasise that there is already a register in place. We are integrating it into a new electronic and centrally held register so as to facilitate accuracy and the kind of ease of access that the Deputies mentioned. More broadly, having a single registry is also meant to ensure that the regulatory compliance of ships flagged in Ireland can be tracked more easily. We are seeking to make the existing register more integrated and efficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I am not proposing any change in the current level of public access. In response to Deputy McNamara's points, I have inserted "shall" in my amendment, which was not the case previously. Now, a person "shall have access". I am still being specific about what that access might be, how it might come about and why it might need a statutory instrument because we are trying to create a new IT system and we must determine how the project will be structured.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">Until that is done, I cannot be more prescriptive in primary legislation as to what that access should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> However, the key word I have included in the amendment is the word "shall", in that the register shall be open to the public. It seeks to maintain the access that currently is available and by including the word "shall", I am trying to address the point Deputy McNamara has raised a number of times. I intend to make it as open as possible, except where there is either a security or commercially sensitive concern, in line with many of the registries available to the citizens and other people. I am including the word "shall" in the amendment to try to address the points made by the Deputy. I have tabled this amendment because while I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment at this point, I am trying to address its objective in a different manner. I propose to change the Bill in response to the points the Deputy has made at different Stages. In addition, in the interim period before this Bill returns to the Seanad, I may continue to consider how it could be structured to ascertain whether there are further ways in which this area should be addressed. However, I will conclude by emphasising again the focus on the phrase, "shall have access", which is a strengthening beyond the present position.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">I understand I will then have the further possibility to conclude at the end. I thank the Minister and do not disagree with the purpose of this Bill, which is to amalgamate previous registers. I support that initiative and have so done from the outset. However, if one shall have access to something in accordance with regulations but there are no regulations, then one does not have access. Moreover, if one shall have access to something in accordance with regulations that are very prescriptive and narrow to the point where they are almost meaningless, then that is what one has. Rather than stating that people will be allowed to have access to this register through regulations, as I have argued from the outset, I seek a statement of principle - by which the Minister and any future Ministers will be bound - that the public will have access to it but of course it may be necessary for it to be restricted.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> The Minister also mentioned the difficulty he would have, in that he cannot give access immediately to a register that has not yet been collated and put together. I completely accept this and it is no different to any other regulatory initiative, such as, for example, the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011. This is why commencement orders are available. The Minister can of course include a commencement order to satisfy that part of it. While I appreciate the inclusion of "A person shall have access", what if one was to appear before a foreign court and state there is a public registry in Ireland and therefore, the mortgage which is registered in Irish ships must be recognised by a Spanish court, for example? There is a considerable amount of shipping activity between Ireland and Spain in particular, because of fishing and so on. I am unsure whether one would be able to persuade a Spanish court that in effect, one had a publicly-accessible register as of right, because that is not what it is. It is stating there will be a register and that perhaps the Minister might make regulations and that, as it is put, "A person shall have access in accordance with regulations" to the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> While I am conscious of the time, the Minister also stated he cannot be more prescriptive at this Stage. While I do not wish to be unkind, one might suggest the Minister should revert to this Legislature when he has more detail and is ready to tell Members what exactly he plans to do. Members have had experience of giving Ministers empowering legislation and to be told it would be all right on the day. This was done quite recently, approximately one year ago, with regard to Irish Water. I do not suggest this is a fiasco like Irish Water but Members have experiences of giving Ministers<i> carte blanche</i> to do something only for it to not work out well. It is important that when Members vote on something, they should vote on certain principles and policies and that the Minister does not have<i> carte blanche</i> to do whatever he or she wishes but is bound by certain principles and policies when making regulations. In this case, the principle and policy is the facilitation of public access.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">I have listened to the Minister's remarks and propose a solution. The simple solution is for the Minister to return and get the approval of the House for the statutory instrument. It should be written into the legislation that it requires the approval of the House. I acknowledge the Minister's officials will advise him against so doing, as they do in every single Department. However, there is precedent for so doing and it has been done in the Minister's own Department a number of times. I recall the late Minister, Seamus Brennan, sitting in that very seat and accepting an amendment I had tabled on that basis, namely, that it would require the statutory instrument to come back before the House and receive its formal approval. Normally, such approval actually takes place in a committee discussion and it merely is approved formally here in the House. However, doing this allows for the detail of the Minister's statutory instrument to be discussed. It addresses the genuine concerns Deputy McNamara has raised in this regard and facilitates the Minister in having the flexibility he requires to provide the requisite detail in the statutory instrument with regard to the accessibility aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> I accept doing this can be difficult to construct in primary legislation but this would be a halfway house that meets the concerns expressed by Deputy McNamara, as well as those of the Minister. However, it would take a decision by the Minister to acknowledge this is a valid point and to accept the proposal to allow the statutory instrument to come back before the House to get its formal approval. Moreover, future alterations also would need to come before the House. The Minister need only include a simple amendment in this legislation to allow this happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">I will respond to three points raised by Deputy McNamara, after which I will respond to Deputy Naughten's comments. Deputy McNamara made the point that if there is a degree of regulation in this regard, the net effect is to state this is a register to which the public does not have access. I respectfully take a different view, as the Government is maintaining the access that exists at present. However, by including the word "shall", it is being stated clearly that this is access I expect to be maintained in the future. On the Deputy's point on how it may be necessary to restrict it, I suggest in response this is the reason I am using this approach, because a change to the restriction at a point in the future would require further change to primary legislation. This would then necessitate a revision of this Bill again and the process in respect of a Bill would start again, whereas the use of a statutory instrument gives the opportunity to look at what that access could be and to change it if need be. However, I must note it all must take place in the spirit of having in place the word "shall". In respect of the recognition that a foreign court may have in this regard, I will check this because it is a point I have now heard from the Deputy but I am not informed at present that there has been any difficulty regarding the recognition of this register by foreign courts.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">It is a good point that I will check and I will be clear on that point as I move through. However, as I speak to the Deputy now, I am not aware of such difficulty. Given that I am maintaining the access that exists at present and am including the word "shall", if that difficulty is not there at present and if the provisions are being strengthened by the inclusion of the word "shall", at the very least the position in respect of foreign courts is being maintained, if not improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> As for the overall point regarding the legislative process, I can only say in response that I am changing the Bill in response to the arguments I have heard. The Deputy may well contend that I am not changing the Bill enough, as is his right as a legislator. However, I am changing the Bill. I am doing what I consider to be appropriate and correct to address the issue the Deputy has put to me.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">Yes, but I wish to do justice to the points the Deputies have put to me because likewise, Deputy Naughten came into the Chamber to support another Deputy on a matter of principle. He could have been doing other things and I wish to respond to his point. This is something I will consider. As for what officials may or may not advise me, I am making this change here because Deputy McNamara convinced me that this is something that needed to be changed and it is an improvement in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I am not committing to doing what has been suggested because I do not wish to mislead the Deputy. I am aware, however, that there is precedent in some areas and I will, therefore, reconsider the matter to see how the system operated in the past. I urge the Deputies to recognise that I tabled amendment No. 2 in response to the points raised by Deputy McNamara.</p>

          <p eId="para_184">I recognise that the Minister is intent on changing the Bill. However, I am not necessarily convinced that the change involved is significant. I acknowledge that the Minister, on the advice of his officials, is seeking to amend the position. I appreciate that Ministers are obliged to act on the advice they receive in order to bring forward the best legislation possible. In that context, one of the avenues which tends to be taken - I stress that this is not a power grab on the part of the current Minister - is to give future Ministers as wide a latitude as possible to amend legislation without being obliged to return to the House to do so. This means that as few principles, policies and constraints as possible will apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> The amendment in my name suggests that the bare bones of the information relating to the identities of those who own ships or who have mortgages on them should be accessible to the public. I am not stating that there should not be restrictions or that people should not be obliged to pay a fee in order to obtain certain information from the relevant documents. I understand that such restrictions and fees apply in respect of the UK register and in the context of the property register here. Amendment No. 2 in the Minister's name states that "A person shall have access to the Register in accordance with regulations made by the Minister and such regulations may include ... the nature and extent of such access". I accept that this is an advance on what is currently contained in the legislation and I commend the Minister on seeking to amend the position. Is there any reason we could not go a step further and state "the register shall be available for public inspection in accordance with regulations made by the Minister and such regulations may include ... the nature and extent of such access ... different categories of access ... and the amount of any fee to be charged for such access"? This would enshrine in the primary legislation the fact that the register shall be available for public inspection in accordance with regulations. Making information available for public inspection is a key aspect of open and transparent government. If this changes the meaning and the manner of what is involved and makes it unacceptable, perhaps the Minister might address why the section could not be changed to read "the register shall be available for public inspection in accordance with regulations made by the Minister" when we come to deal with amendment No. 2.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">I move amendment No. 3:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_200">In page 52, to delete lines 4 and 5 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_201">“Arklow, Ballycotton, Baltimore, Castletownbere, Clogherhead, Cork, Dingle, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Dunmore East, Galway, Greencastle, Howth, Killybegs, Kilmore Quay, Kinsale, Limerick, Ros A Mhil, Skibbereen, Sligo, Tralee, Union Hall, Waterford, Westport and Wexford.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Section 30 makes provision for the list of ports of registration included in Schedule 3. The Bill also provides that the Minister can, by means of regulation, add ports to the list. Amendment No. 3 in my name proposes the addition of Ballycotton, Baltimore, Castletownbere, Clogherhead, Dingle, Dunmore East, Greencastle, Howth, Killybegs, Kilmore Quay, Kinsale, Ros a Mhíl and Union Hall to the list. The list contained in the Bill, as it stands, probably dates from a period when shipping was probably not as well developed. Some of the ports included on the list are traditional ports which have been in operation since the 19th century or the early 20th century and at which shipping business is carried out. I refer in this regard to Sligo and other ports. Included on the list proposed in the amendment are a number of fishery harbour centres at and out of which a great deal of fishing, boating and shipping activity takes place. Killybegs is the largest port, by volume, in the country. In fishing terms, Castletownbere is probably as busy - in value terms - as some of the shipping ports.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> In the context of the ports I wish to have included in the list, I am of the view that it would be important for fishermen to be able to register their vessels in their ports of origin. The amendment seeks to ensure that the people who use the ports in question would be given registration numbers which apply to those ports. As I understand it, what I am suggesting would not place a huge additional administrative burden on the Department. Basically, all it would need to do would be to draw up new registration lettering codes for the relevant ports. The Bill also provides for the transfer of registrations from one port to another. All of the boats operating out of Killybegs are either registered in Dublin or Sligo. Many of our fishing vessels operate in international waters off Norway, Scotland, France, Spain and north and west Africa and it would be psychologically important for the owners and crews of these vessels if their home ports were recognised within their registration numbers. That is what I am hoping to achieve by means of the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> In view of the fact that doing as I suggest would not give rise to a major administrative burden because the register is digital in nature and there would be no need to open additional registration offices, I hope the Minister will accept amendment No. 3 and allow the names of the ports to which I refer to be added to the list contained in the Bill. That would be better than what is going to happen when the Bill is passed whereby people will make representations to try to have ports added to the list when they become aware of the fact that this is a possibility. The latter will lead to a continual and piecemeal process of representations being made to have ports added. The Minister may also be pressured into adding certain ports but not others. I am of the view, therefore, that the amendment would be of assistance in streamlining the entire administrative process.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">I support the amendment. The list of ports contained in the Bill, as put forward by the Government, has diluted the status of other ports which are not included on the list and which have traditional and strong connections to the fishing sector. I would welcome it if boats operating out of Dingle, for example, had the relevant letters included on their registration numbers in order to show that it is their home port. I would like the Minister to examine the possibility of including in Schedule 3 the ports to which Deputy Pringle refers. He should give favourable consideration to the Deputy's amendment because there is a need to confer on certain places throughout the State the status of being ports of registry.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">When I was responding to Deputy McNamara earlier, I made reference to the fact that this Bill would be in the Seanad. I wish to correct that because it was dealt with in the Seanad under my predecessor. I want to make that clear on the record of the Dáil because I would not want to mislead the Deputy unintentionally in any way. I take a considerable amount of legislation through the Seanad and some of my Bills originate there. I gave an incorrect impression to the Deputy earlier that I now want to correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> With regard to the Deputies' points on the amendment, I am afraid I am not in a position to accept it now. I have examined this matter in respect of the point that Deputy Pringle put to me. Deputy Fleming also raised this with me on Committee Stage. I am not changing the existing ports of registry in the State through this Bill. I am not seeking to reduce or change the number, for some of the reasons Deputy Ellis touched on. Although we are getting to the point of having a centralised register, I accept that registry is recognised in 13 locations. I am not changing this arrangement or seeking to reduce the number. Schedule 3 of the Bill lists the 13 ports of registry, as Deputy Pringle acknowledged. I understand the registrar of ships operates in 11 locations at present. My concern is that if I were to make a change, there would be increase in magnitude. I would be doubling the number, from 13 to 26, at a time when my objective is to have a single register in place. It is for these reasons that I am not accepting the amendment. I emphasise again that I am not seeking to change or reduce the number of registers in place, and this is why the 13 ports are recognised in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">I thank the Minister for correcting the record because it was my understanding that the Bill had been dealt with in the Seanad. Nevertheless, the Minister, when on his feet, undertook to consider certain important aspects of the legislation before it is finalised. I urge him to examine these aspects, particularly the question of whether mortgages registered in Ireland could be recognised in convention countries. Ireland is not a convention country and does not plan to be. The United Kingdom is not a convention country either and, as the Minister stated during the previous Stage, many states are not. That is accurate but, nevertheless, it is important that mortgages registered in Ireland be given effect in convention countries, particularly because Spain and other such countries are convention countries. The Minister undertook to examine this and I thank him for it. I urge him to examine the matter. Obviously, the Bill will not now go to the Seanad so the only way he can proceed is to adjourn proceedings on the Bill. By doing so, he could look into this one matter and then resume and put the Bill to a final vote, if a vote is deemed necessary by the House. While we all have tabled amendments and wish to make relatively minor changes, I do not really believe there is any substantive opposition to what the Minister seeks to achieve, namely, the establishment of a central register. Generally, the objective is supported by everybody in the House, and it was probably supported in the Seanad. I urge the Minister to consider this matter before Fifth Stage and sending the legislation to the President to be signed.</p>

          <p eId="para_211">With regard to the Minister's response to the amendment, I acknowledge he said he is not seeking to change the number of ports. I would probably add the word “yet” based on having heard what he said. However, even the Minister’s argument against accepting this amendment makes the case for me. There are 13 ports of registry listed in Schedule 3 to the Bill. The Minister is claiming he does not want to extend the number because there could be pressure to create additional offices of registry. There are 13 ports in the Schedule and only 11 offices of registry around the country. Therefore, there is not a requirement to have an office of registry for a port that has the right to register vessels.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> There is no administrative burden associated with increasing the number of ports and facilitating fishing and shipping people to have their home ports recognised as ports of registry. My proposal is simple in terms of the single register providing a registration code or other arrangement for a particular port. There is no requirement on the Minister to have additional offices. What the Minister will do if he proceeds as intended is create an administrative burden in respect of dealing with representations from ports seeking to be added to the register. An issue will arise as to whether the Minister should draft regulations to increase the number at some point in the future. We could actually do this here today without placing any additional administrative burden on the Department or Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> No additional offices are required to increase the number on the list. At some point in the future, the Minister will probably seek to rationalise the number of offices, but this will not affect the registration of the ports. Therefore, the Minister can address this very easily today. Doing so would reduce the number of representations he will receive on this.</p>

          <p eId="para_219">I wish to respond to what Deputy Pringle said on the administrative burden. My Department will undertake any administration that is necessary if a port needs to be recognised as a port of registry. I am sure the Deputy is already familiar with section 30 of the Bill, which lays out that ports may be added to or removed from the list in the Bill, by order, but that this must be based on certain principles. All the principles, which cover demand, the importance and location of a port and its level of maritime activity, are laid out. If we were to list all 26 and there were to be a change, it would require a change to the Bill itself. As matters stand, I am not seeking to change the number of ports that are recognised. The Bill recognises the 13 existing ports and lays out a process whereby the list may be changed or amended in future.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_321">In page 6, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_322">“ “stillborn child” means a child who, at birth, weighs not less than 500 grammes or has a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks and shows no sign of life, and “stillbirth” shall be construed accordingly. These also include an unborn child who dies in the womb of the mother due to death of the mother but otherwise meets the weight or age criteria herein;”,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">We discussed the matter at some length on Committee Stage and I do not wish to go over all the same ground again. I am a little confused at the Government's position on the matter because we are all trying to achieve the same objective, namely, to enable the registration of a stillborn child in certain circumstances. For many years it was thought one could not do that under the law as it stands, but the Government has recently received legal advice to the effect that this is not the case and it is possible to register certain stillborn children. The Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, kindly provided me with a copy of the legal advice on the previous occasion we debated the matter and I discussed it with a number of lawyers. Needless to say, they all disagree with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> We are trying to achieve a certain objective. The Government has decided to achieve it by taking a strange, contested interpretation of the law, which is currently being hotly disputed before the courts. Our approach is to put forward a straightforward amendment that would achieve the objective without any difficulty. It may be that the amendment contains something else that could lead to further unforeseen consequences. If there is, perhaps the Minister of State would indicate what that is.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I welcome the debate. We also discussed the matter on Committee Stage. We are aware a legal case is pending on the matter. Could the Minister of State indicate, as he did previously, that the Government will examine the matter, when the cases are finalised? At that stage we could seek to ensure that the intention behind the amendment on which we have been lobbied, which is to ensure that registration is possible in all instances of stillbirth, is fulfilled, and that it would not interfere with other laws. That would ensure progress on the matter and might satisfy the family in question which has lobbied on the issue. There are others who wish for recognition in the tragic cases they have highlighted to me and probably other Members. It might be appropriate if the Minister of State were to provide confirmation of what he said on Committee Stage, rather than dividing the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">Deputy Willie O'Dea is quite correct; we are all trying to achieve the same purpose, namely, that a stillborn child can be registered. The current legislative proposal covers that aim. As Deputy Willie O'Dea will be aware from his own profession, if one puts solicitors and barristers in a room and asks for advice, whoever pays the price will get the information he or she wants to hear.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> The provisions on stillbirth are clearly outlined in the legislation. They relate to the time and the weight. The advice of the Attorney General is that the issue on which Deputy Ó Snodaigh has been lobbied is covered. He is correct that a court case is in train. The Department of Justice and Equality has been informed of the legal advice and has written to the Coroners' Society of Ireland advising of the legal advice. The Enright case, which we are discussing, is a very tragic case. Based on the legal advice we received, we are confident that the legislation covers the vast majority of cases. I am only aware of one case. Other cases have not been brought to my attention. I accept Deputy Willie O'Dea's point that we have debated the issue at length both in the Seanad and also on Committee Stage. I do not propose to accept the amendment at this stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_335">Speaking today at the launch of the HSE service plan for 2015, which outlines in detail the spending budget of just over €13 billion, the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, stated the funding will not be sufficient to fully address the increasing demand being placed on our hospital system, in particular the growing waiting lists for elective surgery. We have been here before, in terms of having no confidence in how the Government has formulated health budgets over the past three years, and we have been proven right on every occasion. Again we have a concern that the budget is being built on sand, in that it does not have sufficient funding in place to ensure the basic levels of service required in our public health system. This is not Deputy Billy Kelleher stating this, it is Mr. O'Brien, the head of the HSE, who will be directly charged with implementing the spending programmes on behalf of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> In October, 7,000 people were on trolleys and 377 people were waiting on trolleys yesterday. More than 2,000 beds are closed, 56,000 people are on waiting lists for inpatient day care and 370,000 people are waiting for outpatient appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> Last year, a young man died in an emergency department in Limerick. He was admitted to hospital and marked as urgent, but was not seen for more than three hours. People on the front line have been consistently raising the issue of the pressures the public health system is under-----</p>

          <p eId="para_339">-----in particular our emergency departments. There seems to be consistent denial from the Government that the health services are in crisis. If the Tánaiste wants the evidence, she should read the reports of the harrowing case of the young man in Limerick last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> The broader issue is that we have had spin and lots of it, but next year the Government will already have a budget deficit on 1 January because of the demographic increases and the demands being placed on the health service, plus the fact that it is carrying over €500 million. Does the Tánaiste agree the spin from the Minister will not be sufficient to run the health services next year and that what we need is a proper funding system in place to ensure the health services can deliver what they are meant to do?</p>

          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_341">As the Deputy knows, the Department of Health, the HSE and the Minister for Health received significant additional resources this year, with an increase in the ceiling, and significant extra resources in respect of next year. I understand the Deputy's argument, that he would like to see more money made available to the HSE, but I would first like him to acknowledge that very significant extra resources have been made available. In this context, the Minister has undertaken to continue the reform programme in the HSE and provide to additional resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> According to the HSE's most recently published data, the total number of patients on inpatient and day case waiting lists to the end of September was 56,902. This is an increase of approximately 3,400, or 6.5%, on August. Of these, almost 10,000 adults had exceeded the target waiting time of eight months for a procedure and 1,930 children had exceeded the target paediatric waiting time of 20 weeks for a procedure. A total of four out of five people receive treatment within the target time. The Minister has committed to addressing the issue of improving the targets in the context of the significant additional resources available.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> Trolley waits are an unacceptable feature of anybody's hospital experience and I am perfectly aware of the distress it causes to individuals who use them, and even more particularly to their families who accompany them to the hospital emergency department. The figures to 21 November show that compared to the baseline year of 2011, there were 11,774 fewer patients on trolleys. However, compared to 2013 there was a small increase in the number on trolleys. This is something for which the Minister has been given resources and he has undertaken to make it a priority as he seeks to have ongoing reform of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> With regard to the Limerick case, as the Deputy knows, the family of the patient who unfortunately died during the summer last year consequent on being in University Hospital Limerick asked that their privacy and confidentiality be respected. They said so to all of the parties. The Deputy is aware from previous discussions on the case that the man was in the hospital on a particularly busy night. The notes state he came in on 9 July last year, was seen by a triage nurse, was assessed as triage category two, which is a fairly urgent category, and was placed on a trolley. Subsequently he was in and out, as I understand it, to have a smoke and unfortunately subsequently the man died. As I stated, I am limited in what I can say about the case because of the desire, understandably, of the family to have their privacy and the man's privacy protected.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">What is of concern in all of this is that the Tánaiste is beginning to believe the spin also. The difficulty we have is that the Government is in denial. The Tánaiste spoke about the HSE being charged. In the programme for Government it is proposed to abolish the HSE. It is also proposed to have universal GP care for everybody by the end of 2016 and to cut waiting lists to zero. We have seen no progress in these areas.</p>

The Deputy wants to have an honest discussion.

          <p eId="para_365"> The investment in primary health-care services, as the Deputy knows - he did not reference it in his comments - is increasing very significantly with new primary health care centres opening throughout the country. They are able to provide a number of the services that used to be provided in hospitals, particularly services for children and older people living in their homes who can now get a service at a local level thus taking the pressure off the emergency departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> The Deputy needs to acknowledge that there are now 11,774 fewer patients on trolleys than was the case when we took over from the Government led by the Deputy's party.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">As the Tánaiste may be aware, very serious long-standing allegations of sexual abuse by the late Domhnall Ó Lubhlaí, teacher and founder of Coláiste na bhFiann, became the subject of an internal Garda review in April 2013. The review was initiated under the watch of former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan. The review was deemed necessary because of very serious concerns relating to investigations into these complaints of abuse by An Garda Síochána. Victims feel very let down by the Garda and the criminal justice system, although it should also be said that other agencies of the State, including the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, similarly failed victims in their quest for justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> Their experience of botched investigations and institutional prevarication amount to what they believe to be a cover up. The scale of abuse perpetrated by Domhnall Ó Lubhlaí is truly shocking. Some estimate that as many as 100 victims may have suffered at his hands. One of his victims was 13 years old when he was abused. His name is Gearóid Ó Conchubhair. I raise his case today at his request and with his consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> I now understand that the Garda internal review has concluded on the watch of Ms Noirín O'Sullivan, formerly acting and now confirmed Garda Commissioner. I understand that the review report has been with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, since July. I have with me a copy of the letter sent to Gearóid Ó Conchubhair, refusing him access to that review report. The letter very coldly informed the victim that the review has concluded, but that he will not receive a copy of that review detailing findings and conclusions. Other victims have received the same letter.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> I am sure the Tánaiste will agree that this is mind-boggling. However, equally concerning is that Tusla has informed victims that its inquiry into these abuse complaints is being held up because the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice and Equality have failed to pass on necessary information. What is going on? Will the Tánaiste join me in calling on the Garda Commissioner to make the review report available to victims immediately? Will she join me in calling on the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality to instruct that all information required by Tusla be passed on without delay?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_179" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_379">As I am sure the Deputy will agree with me, all sexual abuse, whether of adults or children, is reprehensible. The Deputy might possibly join others in the House in condemning all sexual abuse. We recently had a discussion on that issue regarding the Maíria Cahill case. If I recall, her response regarding that case left much to be desired.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> On the case the Deputy has referred to, as she is aware I do not have access to the kind of detailed information that she has just brought to the floor of the House. Down the years I have heard suggestions and reports of what might have happened in that case and with the person who has been identified as the accuser. Given that this case is one that has been talked about over a long number of years, I am sure that those people have suffered grievously. I extend my sympathies to anyone who may have suffered at the hands of this individual whom the Deputy has identified. In order to deal with this in a responsible way the Deputy should raise the issues, which presumably she has obtained on a confidential basis from some of the people affected by the abuse, directly with the Ministers for Justice and Equality, and Children and Youth Affairs, particularly in the context of the very detailed statements and allegations she has made.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> I am sure everybody in the House would be deeply concerned about any suggestion of a cover up. We heard in detail Sinn Féin describe the cover up of sexual abuse that happened on its watch in communities in the North of Ireland and with supporters in the Republic. We heard about that in detail. We have had that confirmed in detail. Sinn Féin Members said that such cases had to be examined in great detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">I suggest the Deputy takes this up first with the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs because in terms of the detailed allegations she has now made on the floor of the House I am not in a position to respond on the detail of those allegations. I think she is very aware of that. If she is seeking to assist with the victims, it might be more appropriate to go through the Ministers who have responsibility directly in relation to this in the first instance and then we can deal with it when we or they are in a position to determine, in relation to the inquiries and the allegations she has made, as to how then to proceed and respond.</p>

          <p eId="para_387">One might ask why this request has been made. The simple reason is because these victims have faced a brick wall, institutionally, through the various Departments that I mentioned to the Tánaiste - Education, the Gaeltacht, the HSE, the Department of Justice and Equality and, indeed, An Garda Síochána. That is the reality. There is little point in the Tánaiste saying to me to say back to those victims to go to those various agencies again. They have tried that and that has failed. We know that there has been an internal review within An Garda Síochána. We know the review is complete. We know it has been with the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for four months. We also know, through the victims who have asked me to raise it here today, that Tusla is being held up because of a refusal of the Garda and the Department of Justice and Equality to forward on information.</p>

We have tried to raise with you that the remarks made by the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection here in her last contribution were defamatory in the extreme and were aimed at Members of this House. According to Standing Orders, when such a defamatory remark is made in the House we have an opportunity to raise it with you there and then so that you can ask the Member in question to withdraw. You did not do so and you were not inclined to do so, which is why I took umbrage with the Chair.</p>

          <p eId="para_560">I read with interest the housing document launched by the Government yesterday. While I welcome any initiative that will deal with the housing crisis around the country, I have said repeatedly that it needs three strands, short, medium and long term. It is clear from the document that the focus is almost exclusively on the medium and long term, referring to 2017-2020, a timeline beyond the lifetime of this Government and we can understand why. I see nothing in the document that will alleviate the current emergency situation that leaves hundreds of children homeless tonight. I had hoped to see something that would relax the rent supplement limits which are a key issue forcing people into homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> In 2014, a total of €344.1 million was available in the social protection budget for rent assistance. That has been reduced to €297 million for 2015, a 14% cut at a time when rents are rising and there is a housing emergency. The medium and long term solutions are essential and many will come to fruition in 2020. That does not provide an immediate solution for the 800 children and the families who are homeless and will be homeless this Christmas. </p>
          <p eId="para_562"> The Government seriously underestimates the level of homelessness because there are countless families supporting relatives, allowing them to sleep on couches. I know whole families occupying one room, as I am sure the Tánaiste does, given the location that elected her. How long can a mother and her children sleep on a couch? That cannot be a semi-permanent solution, which it is at the moment. They cannot wait until 2017 for a solution. How many new houses will come on stream in the lifetime of this Government or is that known? Does the Tánaiste agree that the rent supplement limits are completely out of line with market rents? Will she seek a supplementary budget and immediately relax the rent limits to address or stall the homelessness crisis?</p>

          <p eId="para_563">I am very concerned, as I know Deputy Catherine Murphy is, about any family which has problems securing a long-term tenancy or ownership of a family home. We all share a common objective to ensure that as many as possible of our people are properly housed. That was the purpose of yesterday’s announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, the largest committed investment by this State in a very long time to a programme of social housing which will see all of the people on the waiting list housed over the next few years. It did not deal with all the money being spent this year to bring back some of the 2,000 flats and houses currently boarded up or ‘voided’, which is the term used by the local authorities. They are coming back and we anticipate that over the next six to nine months, 1,000 of those will be made habitable for families who need homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> I want to correct one misunderstanding the Deputy may have about rent supplement. There is no reduction in the funding for renting homes in the private sector. In the Estimates for next year there is a provision to move a significant part of the current rent supplement budget dealt with in the Department of Social Protection to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to fund the move and the development of people moving onto the housing assistance payment. This reform has been widely welcomed because it will remove one significant difficulty for families on rent supplement, that very often if they get an employment opportunity they are not in a position to take up the employment because they may be at risk of losing their rent supplement. I assure the Deputy that there is no reduction whatsoever. There are just under 73,000 families or households availing of rent supplement at a cost of an estimated €344 million for this year. The same kind of costs will be incurred next year but some of them will be in the budget for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with those families who move to a long-term arrangement with a county council. There are very significant funds being used to address homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Of course people become homeless for a variety of different reasons. The protocol which has been in operation since the middle of June between the Department of Social Protection, organisations like Focus Ireland and the local authorities in the Dublin region has successfully secured ongoing tenancies for over 220 families. I want us to start looking at rent supplement cases on a case-by-case basis. There are two issues here. First, the community welfare service has discretion in law to raise the rent supplement.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">The other issue is that people on rent supplement are unable to go back to work because the conditions of the rent supplement scheme do not provide for differential rent, whereas the housing assistance payment and local authority differential rent systems allow people to take up work and calculate how much their rents might increase by.</p>

          <p eId="para_568">The money that transferred across to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is still less than the budget that was available last year, even when the €20 million that transferred to the housing assistance payment scheme is taken into account. I accept the point that has been made about rent assistance as a poverty trap. I have made that point continually over the years. While I welcome the decision to address it, sufficient staffing resources will not be available at local government level to deal with it in a practical way. We are asking landlords in some areas to take a 30% reduction. That figure is based on the difference between the market rents and what will be available under the housing assistance payment scheme. There are very serious issues in regard to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> There is no doubt that the Dublin area is the epicentre of this problem. I fully accept that. There are 90,000 individuals or families on the housing list nationally, some 45,000 of whom are in six local authority areas, including Kildare and Cork city. Even though I fully acknowledge that the problem of homelessness is at its most extreme in Dublin, I do not think the solution to it can be confined to that one area. Targets are being set for the next Government, or even the Government after it. This Government does not appear to be setting targets for dealing with homelessness progressively. It is completely unacceptable that a stone's throw from here, we can talk to people who are sleeping on the streets. The extent of this problem and the kinds of conditions in which people are living are being significantly under-estimated. We need to find better ways of capturing the true position of homelessness. It is not good enough for many family members to have to exist in one room, with four or five of them sleeping on the floor and three or four of them sharing a bed.</p>

          <p eId="para_573">I agree with Deputy Murphy that the provision of good-quality, affordable housing to individuals and families is one of the biggest challenges facing Irish society. The allocation of €2.2 billion over the next three years is one of the basic social dividends from the budget. As I have said previously, it takes some time to build houses. The problem with the current housing market, which needs to be addressed as quickly as possible, is that no social housing has been built really since 2002. For reasons I do not fully understand, the then Government decided to move away from any provision of social housing by local authorities.</p>

The target for the increase in the number of houses by the end of 2015 is 15,000. This is not a long-term target. Deputy Murphy is correct when she says that there is a short-term objective, which is to bring all the voids into play. I refer to the 1,800 or 2,000 empty properties that are boarded up.</p>

Some time ago, the Mandate union referred Dunnes Stores to the Labour Court in connection with zero hours contracts. Representatives of Dunnes Stores did not turn up at the Labour Court hearings. In effect, workers who have been put on zero hours contracts by some companies in this country - I refer to Dunnes Stores, in particular - are basically guaranteed no hours whatsoever. I am aware that the industrial relations (amendment) Bill is currently the subject of a consultative process. There is an urgency about this issue, particularly in light of the recent unemployment figures. People are saying that employment is increasing, but at what cost in terms of employment? To what extent are zero hours contracts being calculated into those jobs figures?</p>

I also understand that, in some instances, people will not wish to avail of the legislation, but the right should still exist. It is long overdue and I urge the Tánaiste to progress it.</p>

          <p eId="para_610">Thousands of jobs are being lost around the country. Consider the hallmarking (amendment) Bill on metals. In the fabrication industry, there is no joined-up thinking between the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Social Protection and the Environment, Community and Local Government. New CE markings are required for welders. It costs €20,000 to get each company certified. Government policy has done nothing to resolve this problem. Will the Tánaiste enlighten the House as to whether there will be joined-up thinking to stop the rot of job losses around the country?</p>

Therefore, I anticipate that this Bill will be before the House in the first half of next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_614">Every year, families are dragged through the courts at significant cost to the Exchequer because they are trying to get answers about instances of medical malpractice. The Tánaiste will recall the case of baby Mark Molloy, whose parents, Mark and Roisin, needed to go through the courts to get some answers about his death. It was the Portlaoise babies incident, which was exposed by "Prime Time" earlier in the year. At the time, the then Minister for Health promised the introduction of medical (open disclosure) legislation later this year. However, it does not seem to be on the legislative programme. When will it be published? It would allow families to get the truth of what happened to their loved ones without needing to go through the courts and entering into confidentiality clauses and without the State needing to fork out large sums of money. All that people are looking for is the truth.</p>

						</b>I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_632">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I will make a few brief points in seeking leave to introduce the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Right to Personal Autonomy and Bodily Integrity) Bill 2014. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a referendum to delete Article 40.3.3o, the controversial eighth amendment to the Constitution, which equated the life of a woman with that of a foetus. Its purpose is to delete that provision and replace it with a simple sentence declaring and acknowledging the rights of all citizens to personal autonomy and bodily integrity.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> The basis for this Bill originated in the incredibly successful and well-attended conference organised by the Coalition to Repeal the Eighth Amendment in September 2014 in the city. Hundreds of delegates attended, including medical practitioners, legal people, young women and men, campaigners for women's rights over decades and for human rights, as well as civil society organisations. There were discussions at the conference about what needed to be done to take forward important issues of women's health and bodily integrity. The conference welcomed the fact that Fine Gael backbenchers had recognised the need to repeal the eighth amendment. The delegates recognised that a number of Labour Party Ministers had also stated that a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment was necessary. However, the conference rejected the suggestion that this should be left to the next Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> The reason the conference did so was very much in the context of the tragic Y case that occurred over the course of the summer, which was another verification of how our laws mean that it is poor people and those of vulnerable immigrant status who pay the price for this amendment. The delegates decided we could not wait for the next Government and we should take on board and avail of the facility afforded by the Government's agreement to hold other referendums next year. Consequently, the Technical Group decided to use its Private Members' time to discuss this issue on 16 and 17 December. Members do so while being very much cognisant that the Constitution as it stands actually enshrines hypocrisy. I wish to use the words of the former Minister for Justice and Equality, who put it more eloquently than did I when he was the Minister for Justice and Equality and when Members last discussed this issue in the House. He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_636">It can truly be said that the right of pregnant women to have their health protected is, under our constitutional framework, a qualified right [as is their right to bodily integrity]. This will remain the position. This is a republic in which we proclaim the equality of all our citizens but the reality is that some citizens are more equal than others.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">He also stated that "In the absence of constitutional change, there will continue to be a British solution to [an] Irish problem". I simply do not accept this is valid. It endangers women, it undermines human rights in our society and because of the interests of all our citizens, it cannot wait until the next Government takes office. Members must discuss this issue now and will discuss it on 16 and 17 December. Hopefully, the Government will be persuaded by these arguments in order that this proposal can be put to the people next year. It actually will tally with the opinions of the people, which repeatedly have been in favour of the need to deal with this constitutional block to women's health and bodily integrity rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_665">As I noted yesterday, this legislation represents an updating of the regulatory regime for the health insurance sector in this State. Some of the Bill continues what I acknowledge, as the health delivery system currently is structured, is the necessary system of community rating, which helps to ensure that consumers are charged the same premium for a particular plan regardless of age, gender or health status, thus preventing price discrimination against those more likely to require medical treatment. Unfortunately, it is also but a way of propping up the ailing health system. Members still await details of the Government's long-promised universal health insurance proposals. In the interim, many people continue to take out private health insurance because they cannot rely on the health service when they or their loved ones are unwell and this, as I already have stated, in itself is a tragedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> As long as the type of health insurance market and the type of health funding system that exist in this State are retained, the regulatory regime provided for in this Bill will be necessary. Accordingly, I record that Sinn Féin will not oppose the Bill's passage. It involves a complex system of risk equalisation to support the community rating principle. This entails the transfer of compensation from insurers who carry lighter risk burdens than those who carry heavier risk burdens. All this requires regulation, monitoring, enforcement and as provided for in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> In the absence of such legislation, the unregulated market would discriminate against the old, the sick or any other group or individual that insurance companies decide to be a greater risk. The legislation is, therefore, supposed to be a protection against the working out of the raw profit motive in the health insurance sector. It is supposed to be based on solidarity between generations and also between the healthy and the sick. That is welcome, in so far as it goes. However, as I have already stated on numerous occasions, Sinn Féin would go much further and would extend the principle of solidarity to the way we fund, organise, structure and manage our entire health care system. I will return to this point later.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> Risk equalisation makes possible the scheme of community rating which ensures that all consumers are charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan regardless, as I have already said, of age, gender or health status. The State continues to subsidise the private for-profit health system with private occupancy of public hospitals. Private health insurance still represents a fast track to care for private patients while public waiting lists grow and involves the dual working of hospital consultants in the public and private sectors. The background to private health insurance is laid out in the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2013. It includes such principles as intergenerational solidarity between all those covered by insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> The concept of risk equalisation is used in community-rated health to distribute the risk of insuring citizens with different risk profiles. A risk equalisation scheme has existed in the private health insurance market since 1 January 2013. Young, old, well and less well citizens are balanced to create premia that are more acceptable to all those choosing to take out private health insurance. In light of the system we currently have in place, this is a good thing. It is designed to stop market forces deciding to cherry-pick only healthy patients. Rampant capitalism does not have a place in health care in any circumstances. I am glad the Government recognises that. I am at a loss, however, to understand why it feels it appropriate to apply this rampant capitalism to its planned so-called universal health insurance plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> The private health insurance model used by this and previous Governments allows for a hospital bed charge payable from the risk equalisation fund for each hospital visit involving an overnight stay. The main aim of this Bill is to outline the overall premium payable in respect of young adults and also to allow people to change insurers without being obliged to observe an initial waiting period. The Bill will also make changes to hospital bed credits and to the levels of stamp duty collected.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> Section 2 makes provision for a sliding scale of health insurance premiums for young adults up to and including age 25 and will remove the requirement to be in full time education or to be dependent on the policyholder. The new subsection 5A to be inserted into the principal Act will mean that if offering young adult rates, health insurers shall offer the full range of rates within the specified bands. The regulations to provide for lifetime community rating will come into effect on 1 May 2015. After this date there will be late-entry loadings for those aged 35 and over who have not bought private health insurance up to this point. It will be a loading of 2% per year up to a maximum loading of 70% at age 69 and over. This is to encourage younger adults to take out insurance at a younger age than might otherwise have been considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> Section 4 deals with those people who are to transfer from one policy to another and lays out that waiting periods need not apply in these cases. This is a common-sense approach. Section 6 and 7 revise credits payable from the risk equalisation fund and section 8 specifies the applicable stamp duty rates for the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> Despite everything I have just stated, it seems that the Bill will not have the desired effect because most younger adults who do not have private health insurance are reported to have no intention of taking it out even if these measures are introduced. We have also seen that the HSE is directing hospitals to charge private health insurance patients as much as possible. We welcome the recouping of these costs but we also recognise that this will force more members of the public to turn to the public health system, which is currently ill-equipped to deal with any further increase in use of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> This Bill arises out of a necessity to have social solidarity in the private health insurance sphere. Why not then extend social solidarity across the entire health care system? Unfortunately, it seems that Fine Gael and Labour are wedded to their flawed plan of providing universal health insurance at some unspecified point in the future. Theirs is a system that would see competing private insurance companies gobble up much of the overall health spend and those moneys spent on administration and advertising, with the balance hived off to satisfy the insatiable appetite of investors for profits and dividends. In the case of an insurance system based on competing private health insurance companies, which, as we see it, is the least desirable model, the profit motive and the interests of shareholders - rather than public health - become paramount.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> We still need to know much more about the funding of universal health insurance. What is compulsory health insurance going to cost people who have neither medical cards nor private health insurance at present? We still do not know the answer to that question. Sinn Féin wants to see the development of universal public health care based on medical need and funded from fair and reformed general taxation. We note that recently the Irish Medical Organisation has expressed concerns about universal health insurance as a method of funding universal health care. I welcome the IMO's intervention. We are again calling for an open debate on this matter by means of which we can examine all options for health care reform and funding, not just the flawed proposal of the Fine Gael and Labour Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> The Government is proposing to bring in universal health insurance with the State subsidising those who cannot afford to pay insurance premiums. The State will still have a huge regulatory, managerial and funding role. Why then bestow on private for-profit insurance companies such a central place in the system? What contribution will they make? These companies are funded by the consumers who buy their products. The insurance companies, on behalf of policyholders, will buy services from private or public hospitals or other service providers. They will be obliged to make substantial profits in the process. The Minister has already recognised the failure of the insurance companies to reduce their outgoings and to address their cost base. Why not cut out that profit for the privateers and keep the money involved within the health system or in the pockets of citizens?</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> When Fine Gael and Labour should have been aiming for a system of universal health care that would allow timely access to suitable care - free at the point of delivery for all citizens - they looked instead to universal health insurance as a solution for everything. In reality, it is merely a funding model and a deeply flawed one at that.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">It is a model that has been widely criticised, including by the medical profession, and many examples that have been held up are both flawed and very hard to compare with an Irish context.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> Sinn Féin is strongly opposed to the pro-business and for-profit slant of Fine Gael on health care. Universal health insurance represents a fillip for private health insurance companies and the for-profit health care companies. Similar models in the Netherlands have seen the quality and range of care continually reduced, with premia rising by up to 40%. Further, the majority of the population purchases additional insurance cover to make up the shortfall in the universal health insurance basket of cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> Another important fact is that the Dutch had made a large investment in primary care prior to the introduction of universal health insurance. We, on the other hand, have under-resourced primary care for many years now. In the United States, the system of privatisation simply diverts badly needed funds away from front-line services towards administration and introduces the forces of the market economy, with "consumers" buying "products". The multi-payer model also requires much regulation, again taking the focus away from treating patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> Sinn Féin has long held that an equitable system of health care must be based on a progressive funding model to ensure that those in poverty, or those who are most in need of health care services, can access a service of an acceptable level without having to pay hand over fist at every turn. Again, we do not know what the cost of the Government system will be for an average family. Can we really trust the Government that gave us Uisce Éireann to overhaul the health service? I think not. We have no idea as to the quality and kind of care that will be provided, or even when we will see this system.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> We in Sinn Féin want universal health care, based on equal access for all and on the basis of need, and need alone. We want that to be State provided, funded from fair general taxation and free at the point of delivery. This would involve a higher contribution in tax from the highest earners than they contribute at present. We do not favour the model of insurance-based funding. However, if health insurance is to be the basis for funding, it should involve a State insurance scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> We simply cannot continue to have a two-tier system in which people die simply because they do not have private health insurance. I do not exaggerate. I recall again in this House the tragic case of Susie Long who passed away in 2007. She had been referred for a colonoscopy in 2005. She waited seven months for this test. She found out in 2007 that another patient who had been lucky enough to have insurance had been referred and diagnosed within days. That she lacked insurance contributed to her delayed diagnosis. It is a great shame that we have not moved very far on from this system. While we hope this could not occur again, we know those who rely on the public health system rely on a system that is creaking and groaning under massive strains, dealing with a larger and sicker population, and doing less with less.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> It is appropriate to pay tribute to front-line service providers, including consultants, doctors, nurses and the various other specialists and support staff, particularly across the network of hospital sites. They are doing heroic work at a very difficult time within the health service and personally considering all the strains that have visited all our lives, our families’ lives and our communities over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> The deeply flawed two-tier system is reeling from the health cuts of the Government and its predecessor, yet it is being asked to deal with ever-increasing demand. The promised market-based private health insurance system is not the route to real and necessary reform of our health services. We demand an open discussion on the most progressive and equitable ways to fund a single-tier system, free at the point of care, that provides for all on the basis of need, and need alone. We ask the Government to accept that it has chosen a bad model. We ask for a fair system. That surely is not too much to ask of those currently in government who claim the mantle of James Connolly.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> I dtosach na haicíde is fusa í a leigheas. Ba chóir dúinn éirí as an bplean seo sula gcuirtear blianta eile amú air.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> Like its predecessor, this Bill is a necessary measure for the insurance sector as it stands. Overall, however, the future of health insurance and the entire health system generally under this Government needs re-examination or we will risk wasting further years before we have a system that we can rely on and of which we can all be proud.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_429">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_689">On the face of it, this Bill is not one that one would oppose, and it seems like a reasonable attempt to deal with a problem. The problem, as the Minister knows, is that there is a crisis in the health insurance sector — I hate to use the word "market". I will state later why I hate to see the words "market" and "health" together in the one sentence. However, given that health insurance exists and that many people feel obliged to take it out, this legislation, on the face of it, is a reasonable attempt to deal with the fact that rising insurance premiums, combined with the impact of the recession, income cuts and the consequences of unemployment, have meant the number of people in a position to retain their health insurance has dropped pretty catastrophically over recent years. The percentage has dropped from over 50% to 44%, a big drop.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> Anecdotally, we know people must question all the time whether they can maintain their health insurance or, as somebody told me yesterday, avail of it for six months, then drop it and take it out again when he can afford it. I refer to obtaining cover intermittently. There is a real problem in this regard. In so far as these measures are going some way towards making health insurance a little more affordable, obviously against a background of premiums rising very significantly, by an average of €100 per year over the past couple of years, the Bill seems to be an attempt to contain the dramatic increases in the cost of health insurance and the falling off in the take-up of health insurance cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> However, it is worth saying that the Minister has said publicly he can give no guarantee these measures will actually contain the prices. He is quoted as having said the Bill will create an environment in which the health insurance industry can contain the increase in fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> Ultimately, however, that decision will be taken by the private health insurance companies which is a matter of significant concern because those companies are out to make money. The private health insurers' primary interest is not to maintain affordability or, for that matter, to ensure that subscribers are covered, but to make money by whatever means is best. The Minister might say it is in their interest that greater numbers take out health insurance and therefore the insurers will want, where possible, to make premiums affordable, but the two do not necessarily go together. That is a matter of concern. The bottom line is it is left in the insurers' hands to determine whether insurance premiums are affordable.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> On the face of it the Bill is a reasonable attempt to deal with a problem that we all are aware of, but to my mind this is like a sticking plaster on a gaping wound. It fits in with an approach to providing health care for the population that, ultimately, will not work and can result only in a two-tier health system which also is not particularly good value for money in terms of health expenditure generally, that is, the model of a health insurance market and of generally making a market of the delivery of health services. It just does not work. The problems we are seeing on a range of levels are merely the symptoms of a fundamentally flawed approach to health. The fundamental flaw is the idea that the private market is the appropriate vehicle to deliver universal health care for ordinary citizens and the crisis, in terms of the affordability of private health insurance, is one significant indicator of the unsustainable nature of that approach to health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> The other side of this coin is the crisis in the public health service which is reaching dramatic proportions. For a number of years there has been a very severe crisis which has been dramatically worsened by the €3 billion of cuts in the public health service since the crash of 2008 and which has resulted in an incredible 10,000 staff being taken out of the health service, not to mention the closure of 2,000 beds across the country in the past couple of years and thousands more that have been taken out over the previous number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> Where all of this really stares us in the face is when we hear now on the radio as we drive home the proliferation of advertisements for the Mater Private, the Beacon clinic and the Blackrock Clinic. It is blasted at us, day in, day out, that for a price, if we have the money to take out the particular private health insurance package that is required to get into the Mater Private or wherever, we can deal with a crisis heart situation. If we have an accident and emergency matter, if we have the money, we will get it seen to in these places. With a dire situation in the public health service resulting from cuts, the pressure is on to do precisely that. Otherwise a person will wait a year, as 40,000 people do, for procedures or the person may die, as one young man did recently in Limerick. As was discussed earlier, a patient may die on a trolley waiting for care in the public health service. Certainly, a person could sit on a trolley waiting in the most unacceptable circumstances, as so many people do.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> Some 6,977 patients waited on trolleys in October 2014, an increase of 63% on the number on trolleys in 2007. Those statistics indicate the disastrous situation we face. For those who might be tempted by the advertisements which imply they will not have to go into that nightmare which is the public health system if they can afford the premium packages of private health care, increasingly, for ordinary low and middle-income families, these are completely unaffordable and they are screwed if they do not have a lot of money. That is not an acceptable way to deliver health services which should be a basic human right in a civilised society.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> Neither is it good value for money. Fine Gael often would pride itself on being the party that cares about the efficient use of resources. I point out to the Minister that in the United States, where there is one of the most privatised models of health care in the world, approximately 40% of all health spending is on administration, such as billing and all that is associated with a privatised model. It is spent not on the delivery of front-line health care, but on the making of profits for the private health sector. Is it not obvious that private companies will take a slice of the funding that should go into health services? That is what they are about. Inevitably, where there are private providers, in insurance or in services themselves, they will take a big slice for themselves and that is funding that should go into the health services. The alternative, as the Minister will be aware, is the National Health Service model, funded through progressive and fair taxation and delivering, not universal health insurance but universal health care, to all citizens at the point of need, and without which the Minister will be faced inevitably with the contradictions, crises and anomalies that he is trying to deal with in this Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_430">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_698">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill. This is an important debate and I am glad the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is in the House. It is important, when discussing this legislation that we not only analyse the Bill, but also put forward suggestions for reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> For too long, this debate has gone on and it is time to deal with the real reform agenda, both in the area of health insurance and in the broader health service. Whether we like it or not, health will always be an important issue and it will always be on the political agenda. One can always judge a society by the way it treats its patients and runs a health service. We have seen in recent years the huge crisis in health insurance services.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> Before I get into the details, I welcome the reforms of the medical card issued yesterday. I genuinely hope that these will work because we must ensure that sick and disabled children are guaranteed a medical card as a major priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> We also must look at the broader issue in particular hospitals that have to deal with a crisis of patients on trolleys seven days a week. We have to do something about that. Despite the Government talking for the past four years about that issue, the situation is as bad as ever. It is not good enough. In my constituency, Beaumont Hospital urgently needs supports. It needs a quality system that will free up the beds for many patients who are stuck in accident and emergency not only on trolleys, but also on chairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">Some nights one cannot even get a chair. I know that from direct experience myself because over a year ago I spent 24 hours on a chair before I eventually got into the system. We must face the reality in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> We are discussing health insurance and reform of the health service but I wish to take the opportunity to refer to the disability sector. The sector has been penalised for the past four years due to repeated cuts. The Minister has an opportunity to put disability back onto the agenda and to reinstate and develop disability services. We, on this side of the House, will support him. The efficient management of resources is required. I strongly support such an approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> We should take a broader view in the course of the debate. The health service should never be looked at as if it is just another business service. It is not a private business. We must accept that. Changes are required to be made very quickly when a crisis occurs such as flu or other epidemics such as Ebola. We must ensure we have the infrastructure to deal with issues as they arise. I do not enjoy listening to people prattling on as if the HSE is an SME when it is a health service. Like many colleagues, I firmly believe we should have a broader, universal health service that is paid for out of general taxation. That is part of my political vision for this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Currently, 700 people are in hospital who should be in other caring environments. If the matter were addressed, it would immediately free up hospitals beds which are urgently required in many hospitals. We must be radical, reforming and creative.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> A total of 250,000 people dropped out of the private health insurance market in the five years to the end of 2013. Increases in premiums ranged from 7.3% in 2011 to 12.1% in 2012. In 2008, the average premium paid per insured person was €729, but in 2013 the average premium had increased to €1,050, representing a 58% increase in the period 2008 to 2013. That is an absolute scandal. Families are being hammered left, right and centre. Politicians wonder why people are very angry with the Government and disillusioned. Another reason for their anger is the significant increase in the premium for private health insurance. The average cost of claim per insured person increased by 12.6% per annum between 2008 and 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> The age structure of the market saw a significant ageing of the insured population. In 2003, a total of 13.3% of the insured population was aged over 60 but that had increased to 19% of the insured population by the second half of 2012. We must plan for the fact that people live longer. That is fantastic news, but we must also develop a long-term approach to deal with such issues in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> The number of people in this country with health insurance was in decline from 2009 to the middle of 2014 but since then there has been a small increase of 1,000 people. However, people have major concerns about the overall decline and in particular the age profile of people with health insurance cover and the impact that might have on the sustainability of the health insurance market as a whole. We must be conscious that the health service is not a private business and things change by the moment. People live longer, cures are found and there is a general improvement in the quality of life. That is the case for approximately 70% of people, which leaves 28% of the population who are in a severely disadvantaged situation, who impact on the health service. There are also health implications for the 28.6% of children who were living in poverty in 2014. We must address the issue of economic disadvantage or we will have more problems in the health service and more people using the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> The market has also been affected by the increase in premiums and claims at a time of reducing income among consumers. In 2012, a consultative forum on health insurance was set up, which I welcomed at the time, as I considered it a very important development. We must get people involved who know the issue in a bit more detail. The Minister for Health has appointed a new chairperson, Pat McLoughlin, and the forum has already produced two reports. We must ensure that the reports and positive aspects of the legislation are included in the broader debate on health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> The legislation seeks to amend the existing health insurance legislation. The principal Act is the Health Insurance Act 1994. The Bill also introduces a system of graduated discounting of health insurance plans for young adults aged between 18 and 25 years, inclusive. It would also permit an insured person to move from a restricted membership insurer to another registered insurer without an additional waiting period. I welcome the change.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> As part of an annual process of adjustment, the Bill seeks to specify the amount of risk equalisation credits payable and the amount of hospital bed utilisation credit applicable from March 2015. The Bill also seeks to amend stamp duty levies and some technical amendments to health insurance legislation. These measures are designed to address the increase in premiums and stabilise private health insurance in the interests of consumers. I support the approach, which is sensible. The key point is that we must protect the interests of consumers – I prefer the term "citizens". I am concerned that our focus is still too much on a two-tier health service. We must deal with the immediate problem in terms of the Bill before us and the impact of market forces. However, we must also look to the longer term. For me, that means a universal health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> The Minister probably would not agree with me but if he wants to see a good quality health service in a very poor country, he should take a trip to Havana for that purpose.</p>

          <p eId="para_721">This is very important legislation. It is about containing the cost of health insurance for families across the State and it is very important that we have the Bill enacted before the end of the year. We lost our slot two weeks ago because the deputy leader of Sinn Féin had a temper tantrum and decided to have a sit-in in the Chamber.</p>

          <p eId="para_728">I thank the Minister for being present to listen to the few of us who are present at the moment. Parts of the Bill are good but I worry about other parts. Many families in the country are in distress with their mortgages currently and are afraid of more money being required by them to buy insurance. If they are struggling at the moment, they will struggle even more if we try to put more burdens on them. Before we impose charges on people to buy their own insurance, we must examine the procedures involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> I have health insurance. A few years ago, a day procedure was not covered by health insurance but if one spent a few hours in a bed at night that stay was covered. A root and branch analysis is required of how costs can be cut and how efficiencies in the system can be implemented. For example, there is a need to deal with the cost of medicines in order to bring that cost down.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> Deputy Finian McGrath informed the House in his contribution that 250,000 have dropped out of health insurance cover for the simple reason that between 2008 and to date, people did not have the money. People with young families who cannot afford to pay that bill will not pay it and they will hope for the best that they will not need the cover. </p>
          <p eId="para_731"> I am thinking about a young person in Roscommon, Leitrim or Ballinasloe who knows that the accident and emergency department in Roscommon is closed and there is speculation that Ballinasloe will be downgraded to a 12-hour accident and emergency department. I ask the Minister what is the buy-in for the people in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> The recruitment of consultants and junior doctors is a concern. I offer a constructive suggestion to the Minister. If young people entering college are prepared to commit to working in the country for five years, I suggest that the Government would waive their college fees. This could apply to doctors and nurses as a carrot to dangle in front of them to keep them in this country. If we struggle to replace consultants and junior doctors, then we are in trouble and it is becoming a significant problem in many parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> People with disabilities need to be helped. I refer to cuts in funding for Ability West and the services run by the Brothers of Charity. We have to deal with the situation whereby a person in one part of Ireland is three minutes away from an accident and emergency department and another person is two hours away from that service. We need to be upfront and honest with people. The health service needs a radical overhaul because, in my view, we are going nowhere. The system is in chaos with elderly people currently waiting 15 to 20 weeks, a situation the Minister is endeavouring to address and this is appreciated. However, we cannot keep going from storm to storm because sooner or later the boat will sink in the sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> I am not critical of the Bill because it contains some satisfactory provisions but we need to show the people a clear way forward. We are spending money educating medical and nursing students but once they have graduated they take a one-way flight. We need to invest in those people, to dangle the carrot in front of them. We need to be pound wise in this regard for the future. If we do not tackle that problem I foresee that it will be difficult to fill vacancies and it is a no-brainer that the health service will not work. I hope the Minister will take note of some of my suggestions. </p>

          <p eId="para_736">I welcome the contributions from the previous two speakers which I consider to be constructive and the Minister can speak for himself in that regard. It is heartening to hear Members being constructive on issues such as this because the purpose of this Bill is to attempt to reduce insurance premia so that the figures which Deputy Finian McGrath outlined of 250,000 leaving private health insurance over the past five or six years is tackled. An essential component of our integrated health system is that individuals have the option of taking out a health insurance policy but this must be affordable. A significant issue in recent years has been the ever-increasing cost of insurance premia from private insurance companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> This Bill will encourage younger people to take out health insurance as they are vital to the lifetime community rating concept. Their participation is to their own benefit as they progress in life and it also supports older members of the community who may find insurance premia too expensive as they get older.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> I welcome the proposal in the Bill to remove the 2009 interim scheme in respect of age-related credits and levies. From 1 March 2015, additional discounts of up to 20% will be available for those aged under 17 years and 17% for those over 18 years. I am a father of two young sons and I have a family insurance policy. The premium covering my two sons has been reduced by 50% which is very beneficial and will apply to many families who rely upon private health insurance companies to ensure they can access affordable health care. Such insurance is essential when one has children aged one year and three and a half years old and when one counts the number of visits to Temple Street hospital and to the GP in the past three years which would put a large dent in my and any family's cheque book. Children are prone to illness and to accidents and one must be ready to cater for those situations. Families need affordable health insurance policies because the waiting times to see certain consultants in the public health system can be as much as 18 months. The previous Minister and the current Minister have worked very hard to ensure that those waiting lists are reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> The number of individuals taking up health insurance has increased for the first time since the beginning of the recession, albeit it is a modest increase. This is reflective of the approach of this Government, the Department of Health and the insurance companies to deal with the spiralling costs. As the economy improves, the concept of private health insurance policies being a luxury commodity will, I hope, diminish, and people will begin to recognise the importance of such insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> I take this opportunity to note, welcome and recognise the work done with regard to medical cards, the more humane approach adopted by the Minister and the Department, in particular, when dealing with terminally-ill patients. This is a welcome development, even if late in the day. I acknowledge that this is part of the reform agenda which is taking somewhat longer to implement than some of us would wish.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> Over recent years, the number of individuals between the ages of 18 and 25 who dropped out of health insurance has reduced by 31%. The age cohort of 18 to 25 year olds are the backbone of the private health insurance business because they pay their premia, they do not claim because they are for the most part young and healthy and they support older people who tend to avail of insurance a little more, for obvious reasons. This Bill will encourage younger people to take out health insurance policies along with initiatives by the insurance companies and this is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> The lifetime community rating is a modification of the 2009 scheme and it aims to incentivise people to take out health insurance policies at a younger age. </p>
          <p eId="para_743">Under the system those who take out insurance at a younger age and maintain it will pay lower premiums than those taking out health insurance at an older age, and this in itself it an incentive for those fortunate enough to be able to afford such a policy and who are in work. As the economy and the jobs market improve, and figures for this were announced yesterday, I very much hope we will see more individuals being able to take up insurance again, if their wage packets allow them to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> The Health Insurance Authority will mount a communications campaign on the changes being made in the health insurance market. Given the introduction of lifetime community rating on 1 May, such a campaign should start as soon as possible. Informing the public of precisely what we hope to achieve, not only through this Bill but through other measures taken by the Department of Health, is of paramount importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> I am pleased to see credits for up to three years of unemployment since 2008 will be provided following the expiry of the grace period on 30 April for those who previously had health insurance. During the economic crisis premiums simply became unaffordable for many people throughout Ireland. Unfortunately such premium increases are an inevitable consequence of fewer people taking up insurance in the first place, because the fewer people in employment, the fewer policies are available. The cost of keeping such policies then becomes unaffordable and insurance companies must raise premiums because they are losing their customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> Any measure by the Government to address these issues is welcome, as are attempts to reduce the cost of the provision of health care in the first place, to improve waiting times and to address issues such as those raised by other Members on important posts in the health service. The <i>www.publicjobs.ie </i>website is constantly looking for consultants of certain types, and it is very difficult to fill these positions, presumably because of the salary scale involved. Any measure to reduce the overall burden on the Exchequer for the provision of health care is welcome and this is one of those steps.</p>

          <p eId="para_747">Rather shockingly, I must admit to being the third of the past five speakers to have visited Cuba. I did so a number of years ago on the expectation that President Castro would not be around for much longer and the country would greatly change in the coming years. While certain aspects of the health service might work pretty well, the Minister referred to cancer survival rates not being very hectic. What really struck me is that one is advised as a tourist to bring certain items which children in school often do not have, such as pens and pencils. I remember being part of a group that met two young lads. When we handed over pens and pencils to them, they smiled back most graciously. I was struck by the fact they both had immaculate sets of braces on their teeth, despite the fact they were barefoot and had virtually no clothes. Certain aspects of the health service in Cuba might be admirable, but the dire poverty in which most of the population lives, not to mention the political circumstances in the country, are hardly something which are desirable for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> I welcome some of the announcements made this week, particularly with regard to medical cards. Much pain, upset and angst were caused to people, particularly in the earlier part of 2014 with reviews and the loss of medical cards. The system announced and proposed by the Minister at the start of the week is a welcome development, and will ensure those who have terminal illnesses will not have their cards reviewed, and those subject to review heretofore will not be reviewed again. I welcome the Minister's actions in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> I also welcome some of the announcements made today on the HSE's service plan and the provision of approximately €10 million extra for the fair deal scheme. The waiting times at present are certainly too long and I hope the €10 million will go some way to significantly reducing the waiting periods. I welcome the inclusion of capital funding for the new emergency department medical assessment unit and endoscopy unit in St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny, the building of which is under way at present. I hope it will be completed soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> Some of our hospitals have difficulties recruiting for consultant positions. I specifically refer to University Hospital Waterford which, as I understand it, has 20 vacant consultant positions at present. I am not sure exactly what the cause is because I know many of these positions have been advertised. Sometimes applications are not received, or those who accepted have subsequently not taken up the positions. This leads to a great deal of hardship for a number of families and individuals in the south-east region.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> There is not a great deal of disagreement among speakers on all sides of the House on the provisions of the Bill. There is no doubt the past seven or eight years have seen a significant reduction in the number of people who have private health insurance. This has coincided, not coincidentally, with the economic downturn. I hope that as the economy continues to recover and more people are back in work more people will be in a position to take up health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> I certainly welcome the major provision in the legislation on the sliding scale for premiums for those under the age of 25. A great many of us did not have private health insurance when we were under the age of 25. I certainly did not until I was somewhere in or around my mid-20s. As Deputy Farrell pointed out, by their very nature people of that age tend to be more healthy and do not tend to put as much strain on the health insurance market by availing of insurance. However, they are an essential part of ensuring the health insurance market functions properly. The sliding scale proposed in section 7 of the Bill, which aims to reduce premiums to this category of people, is to be greatly welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> While it is unfortunate there will be loaded premiums for those aged over 35 it is perhaps inevitable. In particular it is inevitable that there would be late entry loading for older people in their 60s who take up health insurance for the first time. I fully endorse and welcome the provision in the legislation which allows for the transfer of insured persons from restricted membership categories to other restricted membership categories. Recently one of my constituents was at the wrong end of the existing legislation in this regard and the provision in the Bill is to be greatly welcomed.</p>

          <p eId="para_757">The main purposes of the Bill are to specify the allowable rate of net premium payable in respect of young adults; to provide for the transfer of an insured person from a restricted membership undertaking to another registered undertaking without the application of any additional initial waiting period; to specify the amount of risk equalisation credits in respect of age, gender and level of cover payable to insurers from the risk equalisation fund from 1 March 2015; to specify the amount of the hospital bed utilisation credit applicable from 1 March 2015, and to make consequential amendments to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to revise the stamp duty levy required to fund the risk equalisation credits for 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> The term "hospital bed utilisation credit" means the relevant amount payable in respect of each hospital stay, on or after 31 March 2013, involving an overnight stay in a hospital bed in private hospital accommodation by an insured person. Goodness knows, we need some of these issues. The prices health insurance companies are charging for beds are astonishing. There has to be a serious examination of these costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> I am happy to have this brief time to contribute to the debate on an aspect of our health care system that is crying out for a more equitable application of regulations governing health insurance. In that sense I welcome those aspects of the Bill that seek to help tackle increasing health insurance premiums. The Bill aims to freeze stamp duty for public hospital cover, introduce young adult rates and reduce the Health Insurance Authority levy from 0.12% to 0.01%. That was greatly needed. Something had to be done to reduce premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> Earlier, Deputy Finian McGrath referred to some figures. I wish the Minister well in his new portfolio. The figures indicate that people have fled or rather were forced to flee by economic circumstances. No breadwinner in a household would want to give up health insurance, but it is a sad choice. I have a large family and we are at the pin of our collar to continue paying the health insurance. Thank God, they are all healthy. People, including elderly people, who have been paying for years, have been forced to give it up because of exorbitant increases in premiums. Other industries have taken repeated cuts in the past five years since the recession came, but this industry has increased its premiums every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> The figures were already on the record, but I will refer to them again. Some 250,000 persons dropped out of the private health insurance market in the five years to the end of 2013. Those are working people, small business people and ordinary people who want to be able to pay to go to a private hospital. They do not want to put huge pressures on the public health service and are willing to pay but it has become impossible for them to pay because the prices have been hiked.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> The increases in premiums ranged from 7.3% in 2011 to 12.1% in 2012. In 2008 the average premium paid per insured person was €729. In 2013, this had risen to €1,150, representing a 58% increase in the period from 2008 to 2013. That is madness. That any industry or insurance company could be allowed to get away with it indicates that the HSE and the Minister did not have their eye on the ball. It is reckless and puts huge pressure on already overcrowded and pressurised accident and emergency departments, and many other departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> I compliment the newly elected Deputy Fitzmaurice, who is still in the Chamber, on his novel ideas about trying to get young graduate doctors and nurses to stay. They and their families have made huge efforts to put them through college to become qualified. I salute them for going into that noble profession. It is a pity that so many have to move abroad for work. There must be some clawback based on giving some service, giving something back. Loans could be provided for their education and maybe have a sensible payback system there.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> The Minister has made the right sounds. The jury is out, but I wish him well. He should be given a chance to look at some ideas. The HSE and the whole system have failed us. Any industry with premiums increasing to that extent over the past five years without action is not fit for purpose. I am a small businessman as is the Deputy behind me. No business person could even dream of getting those increases in profits. The economy has gone the other way but those operating in this area have been reckless. I have many more figures but I will not quote them because the Minister has heard some of them already.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> As the Minister said, regulation of the health insurance market should occur in the interest of the common good. We are all here to serve the common good. If we cannot serve the common good maybe it is time we packed our bags and stopped being public representatives. We are all elected in our own right by the people who expect us to work for the common good. I agree that central to any conception of the common good is a health insurance market in which intergenerational solidarity between all insured persons old and young exists in a fair and just manner. Community-rated health insurance systems across the world use risk equalisation as a mechanism to achieve such fairness. There are many examples across the world. I would not want to see us advocating the use of an American-style experience-rating model over the preferred community-rating model. What happens over there is not all good. A person over there with insurance is fine, but a person without insurance is in a very poor situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> This is especially true given the dangers that exist for members of experience-rating schemes where the common practices of insurance companies is one of denying applicants insurance based on pre-existing conditions. If that was to happen in my business or that of Deputy Fitzmaurice, we would not be in business because there will always be accidents and incidents. Business people generally have a goodwill relationship with an insurance company - they strike a deal and carry on.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> Experience-rating schemes also require a waiting period before pre-existing conditions are covered and drop members when they suffer an accident or get sick, which are not fair or in the common good. It is just another form of bullying. If the Bill sets out to counteract some of these kinds of outcomes then I welcome it even if I am uneasy about some of the provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> I hope the Acting Chairman will not mind me straying slightly from health insurance to general health issues. I agree with what the Minister said earlier about certain people demanding his presence this morning and stopping the work. We then wasted another hour back and forward with other issues which is not good enough. I had to put back by an hour an appointment in my constituency - some of us have further to travel than others.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> The fair deal waiting list is putting pressure back on the system. There are people in hospital beds at €1,000 a night in my hospital - I do not know how much it is in bigger hospitals. They could be in a nursing home for €750 a week or less. The cap must be lifted there. The latest thing is charging for medical card patients if they spend more than 30 days in any hospital, whether it be respite, accident and emergency or a rehabilitation unit such as the one we have in St. Patrick's in Cashel. If they reach 30 days they are charged €25 a day. They do not have €25 a day. These are people who are sick and vulnerable. They would not owe €25 to anyone - they would not owe €2. They are getting sicker because they are getting these bills. I accept the hospital managements are doing their best to pay it at €2 a day, but if they are in for seven days a week they owe €175 out of the €200 payment. It is not possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> I beg the Minister to show some humanity and address that issue because it is not fair. These are people who do not walk away from hospitals without paying their bills. They were born, reared and lived on the basis of paying their way. They would not buy something in a shop if they did not have money to pay for it. They never had holidays. They are not reckless people. It is not right to penalise them and frighten them. Spouses of patients have contacted me to say they cannot pay it. They would take their spouse, partner or sibling out of a hospital rather than accrue a bill they could not pay. That is not the way they operate. Their <i>modus operandi</i> is honesty and integrity, and to support the State and pay their way. To be threatened and intimidated, and get these bills is very hard and crude. Add that to the beds that are delayed the figures add up totally on the fair deal. It is nonsense and bad value for money to have bed-blockers in hospitals and also have that issue to contend with. It is just not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> We are hammering the working man and hammering the old. These are the people along with the small businesspeople that we need to regenerate our economy, to kick-start it and work to get us out of recession.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_776">I plead with the Minister to look at the system; he has put down markers that he intends to do so. We were promised by the previous Government, the leading parliamentary party off which I was a member for a good while, that the HSE would be disbanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">We were promised that by the Minister's predecessor. I am not here to attack HSE officials but to look for some semblance of normality, accountability and understanding. I will welcome this Bill if it stops waste that is clearly occurring and insurance companies that have run amok. I know insurance companies have to be viable and cannot operate at a loss, but the rates charged by them are staggering. </p>
          <p eId="para_778"> I was a patient in a hospital in Cork a good many years ago and I could not believe the charges. I had to travel a distance the equivalent of from here to O'Connell Bridge or a little further and I could have walked it in the morning because I was fine but I was sent by ambulance. I could not have walked back because I had an anaesthetic but when I got my bill the morning I was leaving, which was ten days later, I nearly collapsed. That was 16 or 18 years ago, and I was charged £500 at the time for the trip. I shudder to think what a private ambulance would cost today. There is too much fat in the system in terms of charges. Someone must watch what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Another area of private health care relates to institutions. I salute the Brothers of Charity and other organisations that are providing much-needed services but in terms of their costs, one organisation is getting €860 million from the HSE. That is a huge amount of money. I have one sad case involving people who are very unhappy with the service. There must be accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Regarding nursing care, qualified persons must be involved. We cannot have care people who do not have any qualifications. People who are sick need help, and that aspect must be challenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> The people interested in the common good are depending on the Minister. The comic, Mr. Callan, might praise the Minister, and perhaps slag him, at weekends about his future roles in this or any other Government. I am up for that but I support the Minister being allowed to do his job. I will support him where common sense prevails and the common good is served. However, I will not support him when I see waste and there is a great deal of waste in this industry, and a great deal of over-charging. Costs are exorbitant. People must watch that. I know these issues are raised in the Committee of Public Accounts and other areas but they must be monitored on a daily basis. </p>
          <p eId="para_782"> I support what Deputy Fitzmaurice said about trying to put creative and innovative systems in place. We need change. Everything is back to the old system of not being able to do this or that. There are too many layers in terms of the people in the sector. We need a shake-up. Private people should be brought into this industry. I am not knocking all public officials but it must be run in a businesslike and compassionate manner. A fine balance must be struck between a business manner and a compassionate manner, but I see no sense in paying €1,000 a night for a bed when one can get seven days care in a nursing home in my county for €750. I have spoken to the hospital manager in South Tipperary General Hospital, which I prefer to call St. Joseph's, and it has offers from nursing homes to take people for less than that amount and we will lose out in terms of nursing home places because nursing homes will not be vibrant. They cannot remain viable when operating at half scale. They are a private business and they must break even. They have staff wages, insurance and all the other costs to pay, including oil for heating and maintenance, GPs and so on. If the bed-blockers and the capping system is not lifted, an issue which the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, addressed in a Topical Issue debate with me, it will put huge pressure on the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> I appeal to the Minister on the issue of medical cards. In the name of God and in the interests of common sense and common good, I ask him to desist from charging people who need a medical card. It is making them sicker and stressed and is also making their loved ones stressed. They have paid their way. They have no problem paying a doctor and would not go anywhere without the few bob in their handbag or pocket to pay their way. That is the kind of people they are. They is the way they were born, reared, bred and lived. They have lived frugally. For them to be asked for such charges puts them under pressure and it also puts hospital management and accountancy staff, who must be subject to audit, under enormous pressure. </p>
          <p eId="para_784"> I will support the aspects of this Bill that I find good and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>

          <p eId="para_786">I thank Deputies for their contributions and broad support for the Bill. Its main purpose is to specify the risk equalisation credits, including a 50% increase in the hospital bed utilisation credit from €60 to €90 per night, and corresponding stamp duty levels from March 2015. In addition, the Bill will specify the allowable rate of net premium payable in respect of young adults, provide for the transfer of insured persons from a restricted membership undertaking without the application of any additional initial waiting period and make some other technical amendments to the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> I would like to respond briefly to some of the issues raised, although many of them do not relate directly to the Bill. Deputy Kelleher raised the issue of universal health insurance, UHI. When I was appointed I took it upon myself to review the progress made to date and timescales for the implementation of a number of important reforms, including UHI. I remain committed to the important reforms the UHI system is intended to bring in but I do not believe it will be possible to have the full system in place by 2019, as envisaged by the White Paper. I intend to push ahead with key reforms such as GP care without fees for the youngest and the oldest in our society, the implementation of activity-based funding formerly described as "money follows the patient" and the development of the hospital groups, all of which are key steps on the path to universal health care. </p>
          <p eId="para_788"> Following the publication of the White Paper, a public consultation process was initiated and 137 submissions were received from members of the public and other stakeholders. An independent thematic analysis of submissions was received last month and that will be published in the future. In addition, a major exercise is now under way to estimate the cost of universal health insurance to the State, to individual households and to employers, and that has commenced. This work is being led by the ESRI and when I receive the results of this, which I expect to receive in the first quarter of 2015, I will then be in a position to make a presentation to the EMC and Cabinet sub-committee to set out the detailed next steps on the road to universal health care should the rationale for that remain in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> As we all know, Ireland has a mixed hospital system where both public and private services are provided in public hospitals. The HSE has put in place specific measures to address waiting lists more efficiently in collaboration with acute hospitals, the special delivery unit, SDU, and the NTPF. These include strict observation of the national waiting list protocol, including strict adherence to chronological scheduling and biannual validation of lists for all patients waiting more than three months; adherence to the relevant HSE national clinical care programmes; flexible usage of theatre capacity with and between specialties; the introduction of centralised booking systems; pooling of lists, where appropriate; prioritising day surgery and admission on the date of surgery even if it is not day surgery; pre-admission clinics; and referral back to GPs for monitoring where possible. New pathways of care continue to be introduced to improve patient flow through hospitals, including, in particular, medical assessment, minor and local injury units, and urgent care centres, as well as the provision of care in non-hospital settings, which are increasingly used to provide a spectrum of care which supports the efficient use of hospital resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> I welcome the Deputies' suggestions about retaining staff in the Irish health service. We are having difficulties holding on to nurses and doctors. It has always been the tradition that doctors and nurses emigrate, often to gain experience, but they tend to come back. They are not coming back in the numbers they used to for a number of reasons. It is not just down to salaries, although that is part of it. It partially comes down to the frustration of working in a system that has been creaking for the past number of years. I hope with the service plan published today and the first modest increase in spending in seven years that we will see some improvement in that regard and more hope across our health service. I note the suggestion that was made that we waive or pay the fees for people who agree to stay. There is some merit in that but, unfortunately, if we did it now, it would not produce results for a number of years or for at least a year, and there would be the argument that it should also be applied in other sectors where there are difficulties in recruitment. I welcome a positive suggestion and it is one that merits some thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> It has also been mentioned that insurers should make more use of clinical audit to ensure the appropriate treatment of private patients. The McLoughlin report on the measures to reduce costs in the private health insurance market made a number of important recommendations, including the use of clinical audit. Insurers already have improved clinical audit, however. I agree that there is much more scope for improvement and I will be engaging with insurers on this issue through the consultative forum on health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> In addition, when it comes to fraud, waste and abuse, the private health insurers have agreed to use existing anti-fraud and confidential hotline structures to facilitate combatting fraud in the private health insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> This Bill, taken with the series of measures I announced to address the rising cost of health insurance premiums, are designed to work as a package. I want to make health insurance more affordable again for as many people as possible in a sustainable market and to try to limit the need for future increases. Following a lengthy period of rising premiums and a severe decline in health insurance cover the number of policyholders is for the first time in a long time increasingly slightly, with an increase of 1,000 in the number of people insured in the period July to September of this year. I hope these new measures will allow this trend to continue and that insurance companies will respond favourably.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">Although the Bill signals a move in the right direction, it is, once examined, ultimately disappointing. It is good window dressing and makes all the right noises but political and ministerial control of the Garda Síochána remains rigidly in place. The two amendments that carry most significance in terms of strengthening the powers of GSOC have been imposed on the Government by international law and as such, the Government cannot claim this is as a progressive move. In regard to those amendments, the expansion of section 106 to allow autonomous investigation by GSOC of practices, policies and procedures has long been called for by the UN and the vesting of covert surveillance powers to GSOC to allow it to be on an equal investigative footing with the body it is tasked with investigating was a requirement of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> It is worth noting that when the heads of Bill were originally published the power of GSOC to investigate the Garda Commissioner was understood to be independent, autonomous and not subject to the consent of the Minister. This provision was at that time welcomed by the ICCL and other human rights bodies. The Bill inserts a new section after section 102A of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to provide that GSOC may investigate the Garda Commissioner when the Minister consents to such investigation and only if an offence or serious misconduct is suspected. These circumstances will rarely, if ever, arise. There is no real strength or independence in this function and it is clear that political protection of the Garda Commissioner will continue under this structure. </p>
          <p eId="para_803"> Section 102A provides that GSOC shall report its conclusions to the Minister rather than the policing authority, although this may change under the new legislation in respect of the establishment of the policing authority. It is only through ongoing and constant monitoring and oversight of the Garda Commissioner's activities and policies by an independent policing authority rather than a one-off power given to GSOC to investigate the Garda Commissioner, if the Minister permits it, that we can bring about a transformation of the police force in Ireland and make it accountable to its citizens. </p>
          <p eId="para_804"> Amendment of section 84 of the 2005 Act, which extends from six to 12 months the time within which a complaint may be made, is welcome and brings this jurisdiction into line with Northern Ireland. However, I believe that where the conduct giving rise to the complaint would constitute an offence the timeframe in this regard should be extended to two years so as to reflect the gravity and proportionality of this occurrence and to provide access to justice for citizens in such circumstances. In respect of an indictable offence committed by a citizen in the normal course of events there is no statute of limitations and a person can be charged at any time if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that he or she committed an offence. It is strange that there should be a time limit when gardaí are being investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> As recommended by the Cooke report, section 102 is expanded to allow GSOC to initiate investigations into incidents that might involve an offence or conduct that might result in disciplinary proceedings, even when those investigations could potentially involve a person who is not a member of An Garda Síochána or where the identity of the relevant garda is not immediately apparent. The insertion of section 102A is encouraging in that it establishes, for the first time, a statutory and legal obligation on the Garda Commissioner to provide information to GSOC. This only applies to section 102 investigations and not to the standard section 95 and 98 investigations which comprise the vast majority of GSOC's investigations. Neither does it apply to section 106 investigations into the practices, policies and procedures. Furthermore, in circumstances where the Garda Commissioner is the subject of an investigation, an assistant Commissioner should be responsible for the provision of information which might incriminate the Commissioner. A more definite timetable than "as soon as practicable" as provided for in the Bill would also provide clarity and strength. A time of four or five weeks would be acceptable. We know only too well how things can drag on if a timeline is not set. </p>
          <p eId="para_806"> The UN Human Rights Committee expressed concern in July 2014 about Ireland's compliance with Articles 7 and 10 of the ICCPR to the effect that it was concerned about the ability of GSOC to function independently and effectively and referencing the length of time taken to complete investigations due to a lack of co-operation by the police. As repeatedly recommended by the UN, most recently in the concluding comments by the Human Rights Committee in July 2014, section 106 has been amended to allow GSOC the independence to initiate investigations into the practices, policies and procedures of An Garda Síochána. </p>
          <p eId="para_807">Under section 106, reports will still be made to the Minister who may or may not redact parts before laying them before the House. If we had an independent police authority, it would be more appropriate for GSOC to report to the authority. Section 117(2) is amended to allow the Garda Inspectorate to initiate and conduct investigations or inquiries into the operations and administration of the Garda Síochána without the consent of the Minister. However, aside from this, section 117 remains the same. There are no powers to make unannounced visits to Garda stations, which the inspectorate specifically requested. Also, the Garda Inspectorate will remain a creature of the Minister as per the ICCL description. The Garda Inspectorate has no function or role under the Act to interact with any body, aside from the Minister - in other words, its reports and advices are made to the Minister alone who decides whether to lay them before the House. </p>
          <p eId="para_808"> The amendment to allow GSOC to conduct covert surveillance is long overdue. It was unfair to task GSOC with the investigation of a body but not to provide it with investigative powers, so that is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> It is a pity the Minister and the Government did not vote in favour of our Bill in July 2013 and progress it to Committee Stage, when they allowed it to pass in May 2014. Our Bill contained many of the proposed changes in a stronger format, and a good deal more. It is unfortunate that it took what amounted to a political crisis for the Government to act. It spent a year and a half in complete denial and eventually, when a few heads rolled, said it wanted reform. However, it has been really disappointing since then and I raised this issue on Leaders' Questions yesterday. There does not seem to be a serious appetite for reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> I have to mention the appointments of Nóirín O'Sullivan, as Garda Commissioner, and Josephine Feehily, as chair of the police authority. It could have been done in a more transparent manner and a more independent fashion. It would have been great if a body had been set up to make a selection comprising nominated independent people. What we have seen is two of the most senior appointments in the police force being made by the Government of the day. </p>
          <p eId="para_811"> All the research shows that if we want to improve policing in Ireland, we have to depoliticise it. It is not good enough to have policing completely in the hands of the Government of the day. There must be more independence. As long as that prevails, policing in Ireland will be done with the consent of the Minister and Government of the day. The Garda Commissioner and the Garda Síochána will be answerable to the Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_812"> We need a police force which is answerable to the people and this could be best achieved through an independent police authority. Seven months ago, we said to the Minister that if the police authority to be established was not going to be independent, it would be better if one was not established at all. If this police authority is to be controlled by the Minister, which is what will happen, this is just another layer of bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> It was envisaged that the police authority would have the power to nominate the Garda Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioners and to fire them if they were not fit for duty but from looking at the heads of the Bill on the police authority, that has been removed. It looks as if the Minister will retain control over the appointment of the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioners and their removal from office, if it is called for. This is not how we will get the police force we need. I would like the Government to take a more serious look at this.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> I do not have time to go through everything on GSOC here but the main problem with the amendments relating to GSOC is that the Minister still has too much control over what it does. From day one, GSOC was structured to fail and, sadly, it will still fail. It still does not have enough teeth and clout to be a real and effective oversight body because the Minister is not giving it the necessary power. I do not understand the logic behind not giving it to them. </p>
          <p eId="para_815"> Everything is being referred back to the Minister for approval. If one wants to depoliticise An Garda Síochána, these referrals must be made to an independent police authority, which is not controlled by the Minister or the Government of the day.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_816">Deputy Wallace made the point yesterday that in terms of Garda reform, the area where the Government has excelled itself over the last few months is in the area of spin and presentation rather than in substance. We do not, in any way, make those points lightly but they are based on the experience in the period of time since the changeover from the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, to the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald. Many people had high hopes that the promised reforms, which the dogs on the street knew were absolutely necessary, would be delivered but what we have seen is a slowing down of a legislative programme in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy English, but all of our schedules change. This Bill was scheduled for discussion today and was likely to come up at this time. The Minister should be here because if I am not wrong, I think this is the only legislation her Department has moved since the former Minister left. It sums up the situation we are in where the overall approach would seem to be characterised by broken promises, diluted reforms and a careful media strategy. It is also summed up in the GSOC Bill and Deputy Wallace made many points in regard to the detail. It improves the situation for GSOC a little but the Government could have done much more. I will not repeat the points but we included that in legislation moved by Deputy Wallace twice, that is, real Garda accountability and reform that would have given GSOC teeth. </p>
          <p eId="para_818"> We have had quite considerable dealings with GSOC. When we met it and heard about its role, we thought it was just a whitewash - there to give the impression of accountability but very much part of a cabal. Our experience of dealing with it would lead us to believe that we were wrong in that original interpretation and that the problem with GSOC was that it was structured in a manner that was designed to fail. Despite the best intentions of the people in it, they are not given sufficient legislative power to do the job they have been tasked with and this reform does not give them that power either. It is too little and not timely enough. I suppose that is the key problem with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> Initially, there was denial that the blue wall of silence still existed but then when the evidence could no longer be ignored, an acknowledgment was made that it existed and that our police service needed to be brought into the 21st century, modernised, turned on its head and made accountable to the people. The way in which that should be done is by having an outside body capable of scrutinising it, certainly an enhanced role for GSOC, a role for an independent Garda authority and changes from within. One could not help but be absolutely raging at the announcements about the political appointments of the new chair of the not yet constructed police authority and the new Garda Commissioner. That is not, in any way, to be personally derogatory to the two women who got the jobs but to make the point that it is not enough. One cannot change an institution with the same people who were part of the problem being built into it and making them the magic wand to transform the organisation. There is no international example that would show that to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> Everybody knows An Garda Síochána is quite dysfunctional. There is a huge problem at the top of that organisation and to appoint somebody who came from the top of it to lead it into a changed environment is not the way forward. The Northern Ireland model, which would have encouraged some of those in the hierarchy out to make way for fresh ideas, would have been the way to do it but the Government chose not to do that, which is an indication that it does not want serious reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The report from the Fennelly commission which the Taoiseach promised for the end of this year has not been delivered, illustrating the lack of commitment to reform. The weak Garda authority indicated now is a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> A serious problem for citizens is that the review mechanism set up by the Minister for Justice and Equality for cases of Garda malpractice, which she told us in the summer would take six to eight weeks to complete, has not given any feedback although it has gone through some cases. We know the outcome will not be satisfactory because the procedure does not allow citizens to present their evidence orally to the panel of barristers. There is a lack of transparency. The actions have shown the Government’s lack of commitment to any serious reform. Some things will have to change to give a better appearance but the Government could have done a lot more.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> When Deputy Wallace made that point yesterday the Taoiseach said very flippantly that he was invited to Farmleigh and did not go. The Taoiseach knows well that we read about our invitation in the newspaper. We got the invitation the day before because there had been a mistake and it had not been given to us. We could not go to the meeting. We immediately thanked the Minister for her invitation and made clear that we could not go. She told us she would like us to be involved in the process and we subsequently asked to be involved but have not heard anything back. Deputy Wallace wrote to ask to be allowed make a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, and published legislation twice on these matters. This corner of the House has engaged in a constructive dialogue.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> The Tuohey family went to Farmleigh, the brother and father of Shane Tuohey who died tragically. This family was with us this morning and was dismayed at the appointment of Nóirín O’Sullivan as Garda Commissioner. They had reason recently to contact her when she was acting Garda Commissioner and feel they have been ignored. The Garda Commissioner and the Minister assured them that the case would be considered. New evidence has been brought to the family that witness reports from 2002, and given in 2006, supported what the family has consistently argued, that young Shane Tuohey was injured by people in a car who had an altercation with him. In the past few months it has come to light that the gardaí had that information in their possession for 12 and a half years but never made it available to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP. Those same gardaí, however, were able to hound and pursue Eamon Tuohey, the father of the young man who was so tragically killed, with malicious complaints and harassment, trying to have him jailed. The family has initiated High Court proceedings as a result. They are utterly devastated at the appointment of the new Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> I want to emphasise the point made by Deputy Wallace yesterday about the Garda whistleblower, Nicky Keogh in Athlone. This serving garda made factual, detailed and indisputable allegations of Garda involvement in serious criminal activity involving the heroin trade and entrapment, setting people up in terms of drug dealing. That happened eight months ago. The Garda is conducting an internal investigation which Nicky Keogh has been told is progressing well but nothing else has been said about it. What does somebody like that feel when the acting Garda Commissioner, who said that whistleblowers would be protected inside her force, is appointed Garda Commissioner although his information entered the public domain on her watch? Since then he has been subjected to weekly harassment by senior gardaí who have sought to manufacture complaints against him, unsuccessfully, who monitor everything he does and have been involved in a systematic campaign to undermine him. This is not good enough. The problems with the functioning of An Garda Síochána highlighted in the recent past are still there. If the Government is not serious about changing them it should not say it will appoint an independent policing authority and deal with them when it is not going to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> Before Josephine Feehily was appointed as chairperson designate of the independent policing authority the manner of the appointment was roundly condemned by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Dermot Walsh, a foremost expert on proper policing in this State. He spelt out how the manner in which the Government was going about the appointment meant that the process was heavily orientated towards secrecy and Government control, was exclusively in the patronage of the Government and sat very uneasily with the idea of an independent policing authority. It handpicked one woman and used her to make an “open and transparent” – not – decision to appoint another one to the head of the Garda Síochána and nobody knows anything about that process. Calling it open and transparent does not make it so. The reforms to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, although they improve the situation a little bit, are symptomatic of the overall approach on these issues, which is to make it look like the Government is doing something, do a little bit but miss out on significant opportunity to transform radically the police service of this State in the manner that is necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_827">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I note that it is part of the Government's and the Minister for Justice and Equality’s pledged reform of policing and the overhaul of the legislative framework for An Garda Síochána. These promised reforms arise out of the plethora of reports and controversies over the past year with the Cooke, Guerin and Garda Inspectorate reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> I have always been strongly of the view that An Garda Síochána should be managed by an independent Garda or policing authority as is the case in so many other jurisdictions. Of course this was the policy of the Labour Party for many years. It was perhaps most cogently expressed in a policy document by the present Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin. I welcome the Minister's commitment to establish the policing authority and her promise to publish the necessary legislation for the new authority in the coming months. I have been a long-time supporter of community policing. I helped organise Garda and community meetings for many years before the existing joint policing committees, JPCs, were established. The gardaí in our Dublin metropolitan division in the north-central area of Dublin city were always very supportive of those meetings, even before the legislation existed.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> I spoke in this House earlier this year when Members discussed serious allegations raised about An Garda Síochána from claims made by whistleblowers, including Sergeant Maurice McCabe. At that time, I said that I agreed with the sentiments of former Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala O'Loan, about the deficiencies in the current structure and powers of GSOC as compared to the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman. Baroness O'Loan had said specifically that there were three issues which would preclude her from ever taking up the role of Garda Ombudsman: the lack of powers of GSOC to investigate the performance of a Garda Commissioner; the lack of power GSOC has to access all of the information, through police using leading systems effectively, PULSE, etc. that it requires from An Garda Síochána to carry out its investigations; and the fact that serving gardaí are working inside GSOC in a liaison capacity. Only one of these fundamental issues, the extension of GSOC's powers to investigate the Garda Commissioner, is addressed in the Bill. Some people have raised concerns about the provisions of section 7 and how it will operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> I welcome the provisions contained in the Garda Síochána Amendment (No. 3) Bill 2014 and note it is part of a wider reform of policing in this country. However, it appears the Bill does not go far enough in addressing identified deficiencies with the operation of GSOC and the powers afforded to it. The Bill lacks clarity in some of its primary provisions, particularly in relation to when the time limit for making complaints actually kicks in and the lack of express timeframes for the Garda Síochána to be required to send necessary information to GSOC in order for GSOC to carry out its investigations. Those matters need to be considered more closely. The Bill is silent on some of the identified necessary reforms such as taking the Garda Síochána completely out of GSOC to ensure full impartiality and independence. One of the core principles of natural justice is <i>nemo iudex in causa sua</i>, no one should be a judge in his own case.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> I served as a spokesperson in various areas during the years. I held various portfolios, including communications and transport. I am aware that the existing staff members of a telecommunications company would not be embedded in the Commission for Communications Regulation in some way. Similarly, existing staff members of an energy company would not be embedded in the Commission for Energy Regulation. Such a lacuna will continue in this area after this legislation has been enacted. People who are being regulated should not be working within the office of the regulator. As long as we continue to allow members of the Garda to be involved in any capacity in the investigatory functions of GSOC, we will not be true to the core principle of natural justice. This issue should be specifically addressed in the Bill before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> While I welcome the extension of GSOC's remit to include investigations concerning the Garda Commissioner, I share the concerns expressed by some stakeholders and experts, including Professor Dermot Walsh, about the apparent veto the Minister for Justice and Equality will have in any proposed investigation by GSOC regarding the Garda Commissioner. I also welcome the inclusion of a new power for GSOC to carry out investigations on its own initiative, which is very important. I note that the Office of the Ombudsman for Children has always had the power to carry out investigations on its own initiative under section 7 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> I welcome the strengthened powers of surveillance that are to be afforded to designated officers of GSOC to investigate complaints, particularly about alleged criminal behaviour. I note that some concern has been expressed about the extension of surveillance powers to GSOC, specifically the possibility that this could interfere with ongoing criminal investigations by An Garda Síochána. There is a mechanism in place for surveillance applications to be invigilated by the Judiciary under section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009. Other specific procedures for surveillance in urgent cases are provided for in section 7 of the Act. These provisions should afford the necessary safeguards for any surveillance application made by designated officers of GSOC under the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, as amended by this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> My concerns about the Bill and the existing GSOC legislative framework are based on my experience of constituents interacting with the GSOC and briefings I have received from the PARC road safety group which has extensive experience in supporting families who have made complaints to GSOC about traffic collisions. It has repeatedly come to my attention that the existing six month time limit for initiating complaints is too short. It has precluded some potential complainants from being afforded an opportunity to make a complaint to GSOC. In that context, I welcome section 4 of the Bill which amends section 84 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 by increasing the permissible time limit for making complaints to GSOC from six months to 12, while retaining the ability of GSOC to extend the time limit if there are good reasons for doing so. The existing section 84(1) of the 2005 Act provides that "a complaint must be made within the period of 6 months beginning on the date of the conduct giving rise to the complaint or within any extension of that period allowed under subsection (2)". I believe there is a lack of clarity about the beginning of the time limit. Does it begin on the date on which the incident giving rise to the complaint occurred, or does it begin on the date on which the complainant became aware of the conduct giving rise to the complaint? I recognise that this is a somewhat technical issue. The lack of clarity about when the time limit kicks in has been prohibitive for some complainants, particularly those who have gone through traumatic experiences and find the GSOC complaints system difficult to navigate.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> Another issue that has been raised with me but which is not addressed in the Bill relates to any discipline or sanctions that may be imposed when a complaint about a member of An Garda Síochána is accepted and upheld by GSOC. As far as I am aware, there is no obligation on An Garda Síochána to inform GSOC or the complainants about the disciplinary sanctions imposed on a member who has been found by GSOC to have been involved in misbehaviour. This could and should be addressed in the legislation before the House. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, might consider amending the Bill to bring more clarity and transparency to it and ensure complainants will have an idea of how satisfactorily their complaints have been addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> I refer to the express provision in section 9 of the Bill that inserts a new section after section 103 in the 2005 Act, requiring An Garda Síochána to supply information necessary to carry out investigations to GSOC as soon as practicable. I acknowledge the express inclusion of this requirement in the Bill. I appreciate that the tardy exchange of information between the Garda and GSOC has rightly been a point of contention and is now the subject of revised protocols. Many other Deputies have made that point in the House. The provision in the Bill relating to the exchange of information could be much more robust. It should include specific timeframes during which the Garda would be compelled to supply information requested by GSOC which has been deemed necessary for investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> A related concern in the area of access to information is the lack of an express provision in the Bill for designated officers of GSOC to have access to the PULSE system. In its report on the review of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality recommended that access by GSOC to PULSE should be placed on a statutory footing, not by way of protocols. This recommendation was made by a dedicated committee of the House in a report that further states "the access to Garda systems is of integral importance to the operation of effective oversight of An Garda Síochána". The Minister's stated aim in introducing the Bill and reforming the 2005 Act is to improve confidence in policing and strengthen the powers of GSOC. I suggest GSOC will not be in a position to adequately carry out some investigations without being permitted to access PULSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> How and by whom will the activities of GSOC be invigilated? I note that Vicky Conway who has written extensively on policing matters has suggested it is unclear how the public will complain about GSOC's performance or use of its powers. In other words, <i>quis custodiet ipsos custodes</i>? Who will guard the guardians? We often use this famous phrase in reference to An Garda Síochána, but who will make sure GSOC is doing its job? I assume there will be some oversight by the new policing authority. Perhaps the Minister might clarify this matter for us when she replies at the end of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> I welcome this legislation as a first small step towards bringing about necessary reforms to policing in Ireland and the oversight of An Garda Síochána. As I have pointed out, a number of outstanding issues need to be addressed, particularly with regard to the information which can be accessed by GSOC designated officers and the timeframes in which information must be provided for GSOC by An Garda Síochána. Serving gardaí should not be working in GSOC in any capacity, as this completely undermines the independence of the GSOC organisation. I hope some of the other issues I have raised that merit further clarity in this legislation such as the question of when the time limit for making a complaint will kick in will be addressed on Committee Stage or in the further promised legislation the Minister plans to introduce.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> Many Deputies read the recent Garda Inspectorate report very carefully. I raised the issue, too. I note that a former follow member of one of the local policing committees in my constituency is present in the Chamber for this debate. He shares my interest in how Garda statistics, particularly crime statistics, are collated and presented to us and the public. There are some concerns in this regard. I have been assured by the chief superintendent in our region, Mr. Frank Clerkin, that An Garda Síochána can stand over the statistics we are presented with on a bimonthly or trimonthly basis. I believe that to be the case. The Garda Inspectorate report was disturbing. I hope the Minister will respond to it and agree to debate it in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_842">It must be worth saying one of the main purposes of the Bill, other than bolstering the authority of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, is to alleviate much of the uncertainty and concern in the public domain about An Garda Síochána. Unfortunately, the public perception of the force has been damaged in the past couple of years. We are familiar with the whistleblowers episode, the independent operation of GSOC and the bugging incident or whatever one might want to call it. The Bill is welcome as part of a suite of measures introduced by the Government in the justice area to deal with the governance of An Garda Síochána and associated agencies. As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality which is chaired by Deputy David Stanton, I am pleased to have played a role in drawing up the reports that have fed into the legislative process in this regard. It has been a thoroughly interesting experience for me as a first-time Member of Dáil Éireann and a relatively new member of the committee in question. On that basis, I commend the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, and the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for the work done by the Department of Justice and Equality on the GSOC issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> When I was drawing up my notes on the Bill, I wrote that it was an important first step in the reformation of the justice system and An Garda Síochána. Of course, that is not the case. The debate on the issues raised by the Bill was delayed for a number of weeks owing to the shenanigans of others in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Since then, Ms Josephine Feehily has been appointed as chairperson of the policing authority, which was a welcome step. The appointment of Ms Nóirín O'Sullivan as Garda Commissioner, having held the interim position for a number of months, has also been confirmed. I had the pleasure of meeting the Commissioner a couple of times. From speaking with rank and file members of An Garda Síochána in recent days, I know that her appointment has been welcomed. I hope that it acts as a catalyst for confidence to be restored among gardaí so that the Garda can get back to the business at hand with certainty over its role in society. I am certain that their confidence took a knock in recent months.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> I also welcome Sergeant Maurice McCabe's comments about the Commissioner's appointment. Given his public profile, it is good that he, as a serving member of the Garda, recognises the importance of her appointment and her open approach while Acting Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> The Bill deals specifically with bolstering the powers of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, a matter that the justice committee of which I am a member debated in detail in recent months. For example, we assessed the policing authorities of Northern Ireland and Scotland and I took it upon myself to assess similar authorities in the Netherlands and Belgium. Our new authority's independence and position within the structure of policing in Ireland are to be welcome. The hierarchy that has been established is a positive step.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> The Government's reform agenda in this regard is important to the public, as it provides them not only with the justice system and police service that they need, but also the ones they deserve and for which they pay. The public deserve a police system of the highest standard, one that addresses the systemic failures of the past and is prepared for the challenges currently facing society as well as those that will face it in future. In addition to the associated upcoming legislation, the Bill highlights the fact that the Government has taken lessons from the inherent faults in the justice system, its governance and its oversight procedures by putting in place robust measures. The inclusion of the Garda Commissioner under GSOC's remit for the first time is welcome. This provision allows for the creation of clear structures of accountability, the value of which cannot be underestimated as we move towards the development of a more effective and progressive system of policing. That additional police powers are being granted to GSOC to allow for investigations to be carried out regarding suspected criminal behaviour in the force is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> As we have seen this year, communication between the Garda and GSOC has been troublesome, to say the least. I am glad to see that this issue is being tackled through the Bill by ensuring that the Garda provides GSOC with requested information as soon as is practicable. This will allow GSOC to carry out its work more efficiently while also avoiding the potential for disagreement between it and the Garda. Overall, this provision will strengthen the oversight of the Garda and provide GSOC with a greater ability to carry out thorough investigations. The Bill also clarifies the fact that GSOC will be entitled to carry out investigations where the identity of the garda concerned may not be known at the time the investigation begins and where a person who is not a garda may have been involved in the offence or behaviour in question. The broadening of the scope for the Minister to refer an issue to GSOC for investigation in the public interest is also a welcome development. Previously, it was not allowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> Section 4 of the Bill is an important amendment to the Act. The time limit within which a complaint can be made to GSOC is to be extended from six months to 12 months. However, I would like this provision to be reviewed in future so as to ensure that it is the most effective means of extending the time limit for such complaints. The extension was a recommendation of the report on the review of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. In the committee's report, we recommended the possibility of allowing the time limit to run from the date upon which the complainant knew or reasonably ought to have known about the conduct precipitating the complaint. This recommendation could be worthy of consideration. I ask the Department and Minister to bear it in mind after the Bill is enacted and has had time to bed down.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> Greater autonomy will be provided to GSOC under the Bill. For the first time, it will be able to carry out investigations into the practices and procedures of the Garda of its own volition and without being requested to do so by the Minister. This measure will benefit the policing service significantly and I welcome its inclusion. Furthermore, section 11 enables the Garda Inspectorate to carry out investigations on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister into aspects of the operation and administration of the Garda. Currently, such examinations can only take place at the request of the Minister. Recently, the Garda Inspectorate issued an extremely large report that detailed quite a number of recommendations. I hope that the committee will be in a position to review them in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> Sections 12 and 13 are fundamental in ensuring that GSOC has the power to carry out criminal investigations thoroughly. Section 12 amends the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and will allow GSOC to intercept communications as part of a criminal investigation. As with CAB's operations, such powers will only aid in ensuring that criminality is stamped out. Section 13 amends the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 to allow GSOC carry out surveillance as part of a criminal investigation that concerns an arrestable offence. Providing GSOC the same power as the Garda in such circumstances will make for a more effective organisation that can carry out more thorough investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> As I mentioned, I prepared these notes some time ago, which is why the next section in them references the independent policing authority. That has already come to be, so I will skip over it.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> The Government will take a number of additional measures relating to, for example, the Public Appointments Service and the chairperson of the independent policing authority. Our committee recommended that "the selection of nominees to the Garda Authority [become] the responsibility of the Public Appointments Service, with their consideration and appointment reserved for the Minister and Government". Such a process for appointing senior personnel to the bodies in question is of the utmost importance so as to ensure that the best candidates, in terms of suitability and qualifications, are selected. While the Government did not follow this recommendation to the letter, the appointment of Ms Feehily, a person of considerable experience in Revenue and elsewhere in the public service, was a good one. I am sure that she will carry out her job well. However, future appointment processes should go through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> The establishment of an independent review mechanism is an important aspect of justice reform as we continue to move towards the more effective and accountable system that the country requires. The purpose of an independent review mechanism is to investigate complaints about Garda misconduct. In this regard, I would like to see additional processes put in place during the next six months so as to review the implementation of existing legislation as well as this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> In the area of justice, it has been the case in the past that certain items of enabling legislation for the establishment of such State agencies have been left, thereby allowing them to operate without a constant review process. While the Department is poised to be the primary source of that review, the justice committee should also have responsibility in this area. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, is herself a member of that committee and it is of key importance to give such authority or possibilities to that committee to review this legislation, as well as the manner in which these agencies operate. For instance, it would be of significant importance to have high-ranking members of An Garda Síochána appear before the justice committee to discuss the operation of various parts of the service, as well as representatives of other agencies such as the policing authority and GSOC itself. Even if such appearances were not on a questions-and-answer basis, the making of statements on the record of the Dáil certainly would be beneficial for public perception of how such agencies are run for the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> Further recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in respect of the review of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 have been taken into account by the Minister and I hope Members will see the implementation of more of the recommendations that have yet to be included in the Bill as the Government's reform agenda progresses. To ensure that GSOC can carry out its work in an effective manner, the justice committee has recommended that consideration be given to the establishment of a helpline number through which people can determine whether a complaint is warranted and another, separate, hotline number through which a complaint can be made. This would make the complaints process more effective and therefore provide a better service to the public. Another progressive recommendation from the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality was that consideration be given to the establishment of an officer rank within the Garda Síochána. This model is based upon that used in the Metropolitan Police Service in London and such a model would allow for a streamlining of the Garda service, as well as a certain degree of specialisation in respect of the provision of policing services in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> The implementation of continuing professional development, CPD, courses in Garda training would be beneficial for the hard-working men and women of An Garda Síochána and for the public. It would allow gardaí to be better prepared to face the societal challenges of the day. If one compares this with other professions such as teaching, nursing or other areas in the health care sector, it is extraordinary that from the time recruits leave Templemore for their first Garda appointment and as they work their way up through the ranks, no CPD mechanism is available for them unless they are members of the rapid response unit or something along those lines, such as receiving firearms training and so on. This is something that must be done. The Garda Inspectorate highlighted the need for an investment of approximately €40 million in An Garda Síochána's computer systems. In addition to the €40 million required in that regard, I submit that a considerable sum of money is required for continuing professional development training courses within An Garda Síochána in order that its members can do their jobs efficiently and effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> In addition, as the economy improves and as the moratorium on public service employment is relaxed if not lifted, I hope to see increasing numbers of civilians entering the service of An Garda Síochána to take over the administrative duties of front-line members of the force at all ranks, because there is no substitute for additional members of An Garda Síochána getting out on the beat and ensuring they have a visible presence.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> I welcome the recent approval of the Supplementary Estimates for 2014, which allowed for the purchase, for instance, of 400 Garda vehicles this year and which I understand will be fitted out early in the new year at a cost of approximately €3 million. Those additional vehicles, which will be deployed across the State to replace vehicles that have reached the 300,000 km mark, are essential tools for An Garda Síochána to carry out its duties effectively. There are rural areas in which there are hundreds of kilometres in round trips between certain points within a particular division and even in my own constituency of Dublin North, it is essential that the vehicles there, which I am happy to report are relatively new, are updated continuously. I wish to return to the development of the knowledge base and experience of An Garda Síochána and to ensuring the knowledge gardaí have in the performance of their duty is supported both by the Department of Justice and Equality and within An Garda Síochána itself. This is why the Minister should, if the budget allows, consider continuing professional development courses for members in a manner similar to that within the teaching ranks, whose members regularly attend refresher courses in certain areas perhaps every two to three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> I commend the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on her work on this Bill. It is a significant step towards ensuring the public has a positive take on the operation of An Garda Síochána in terms of rooting out mistakes, ensuring they do not happen again and learning from them. I want a continued review process in this regard to occur that would include, in particular, the operation of GSOC over the coming months.</p>

          <from>Deputy David Stanton<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_861">I wish to make some points in respect of this important legislation. One of the cornerstones of our democracy and our Republic is the rule of law. Laws are debated, discussed, agreed and passed in this Chamber and in the Seanad before being signed into law finally by the President. Our democracy depends on the rule of law and our freedoms as citizens depend on the rule of law, among other things. However, the rule of law is crucial. Each Member elected to this Chamber should respect the rule of the law and should respect the law as passed. He or she may not agree with them but should obey them and should respect them. If a Member does not agree with them, he or she should try to change them by bringing forward Bills, by tabling amendments or through discussion and debate. Any other methods that are used to change laws, such as have been seen recently like street politics, intimidation or bullying threaten to subvert our democracy and our freedoms and must be taken very seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> As a Legislature, the Oireachtas gives the Garda enormous powers and with those powers come enormous responsibilities. There must always be checks and balances when powers are given out. There must be checks and balances and oversight is crucial. Such oversight must be trusted, must be clear and must be strong. Mention has been made of culture in the debate about the Garda Síochána and of cultures that have built up over decades including cultures of secrecy and of circling the wagons. I believe the study of sociology will tell one that most bureaucracies will circle the wagons when threatened. I believe Comte was the sociologist who initially came up with the concept that bureaucracies will defend themselves, that is, the system will defend itself. This is why bodies such as GSOC, the Garda Inspectorate, the proposed Garda authority, Oireachtas committees and so on are needed. It is to ensure there is correct oversights of the powers possessed by the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> I will refer to an issue I have in the context of a visit by a delegation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to Northern Ireland and Scotland. I would bet that until recently, many citizens in the State did not know what the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, was. However, in Scotland and Northern Ireland, members of the committee found there was one person as ombudsman and that person was identified with the office. Members got the sense from being in those jurisdictions that people in Scotland and Northern Ireland knew what the ombudsman was, but that citizens here did not.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> I urge the Minister to reconsider the position and designate one person to act as ombudsman for the Garda. We have had some great ombudsmen in the past. The former Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, was recently appointed as Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. Ms Logan brought personality, strength and identity to and took ownership of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. I contend that a similar approach is required in respect of the position of ombudsman for the Garda. In that context, there is a need to appoint a strong, independent person who would actually bring identity to the office as required. Provision in this regard is not made in the Bill but I am of the view that it should be. I intend no reflection on the current Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. However, a commission is not an ombudsman, as such, rather it is a committee. It is crucial that what I have outlined should be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> Deputy Farrell referred to the need for ongoing training of members of the Garda Síochána. Like the Deputy, I am of the view that this is an extremely important matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> I welcome the fact that all members of the force, including the Garda Commissioner, are accountable to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. If it were the case that a holder of the office of Garda Commissioner were to be investigated by the commission - in whatever form it takes in the future - as Deputy Wallace noted, such an event would be both rare and serious. Depending on the nature of the matter involved - probably a criminal charge of some sort - I am of the opinion that the Garda Commissioner would have to be obliged to step aside during any investigation. Provision in this regard should be included in the legislation.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_867">I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy English, for being in attendance.</p>
            <p eId="para_868"> The Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, was establish under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 on foot of the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector in 2000, which contained a number of recommendations in respect of tenants and landlords. In the recent past, situations involving individuals I refer to as "tenants from hell" have come to my attention. We all know there are landlords who are no saints but the PRTB seems to be biased towards tenants. I am aware of a number of hard-working people who have bought houses and rented them out to tenants. The latter are very often in receipt of rent supplement but, on occasion, decided not to pay this over to their landlords. I do not know what is happening with the money involved but the landlords are not receiving anything. As a result, they try to remove the tenants from their properties but they find this extremely difficult to do. I have come across cases where the type of thing to which I refer has gone on for almost a year. As a result, some landlords have found themselves out of pocket to the tune of up to €10,000. They cannot pay their mortgages and, in some instances, their mortgages can be damaged. The PRTB appears to be powerless to do anything about this. If a landlord fails to pay the mortgage on his or her property and if the latter enters into arrears, his or her credit rating is damaged. I understand that 70% of landlords have mortgages and cannot meet their mortgage payments without the rent paid by tenants. This is an extremely serious issue. If a landlord changes the locks on his or her house when the tenant is out, he or she can face a fine of up to €20,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_869"> It has been suggested that tenants should not have access to the PRTB dispute resolution process if they do not continue to pay their rent. I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government give consideration to this proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_870"> Will the Minister of State indicate the current status of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill? Is it proposed to amend the principal Act to make provision in respect of the retention of deposits by landlords and the non-payment of tenants who remain <i>in situ</i>? What are landlords to do with regard to such tenants? I request that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government seek to streamline and speed up the PRTB's dispute resolution process. I understand that landlords in New Zealand can access a hearing within ten days if there are rent arrears involved and that any decisions handed down are immediate and fully enforceable. Funding in this regard is provided from a deposit protection scheme which places no requirement on landlords to register tenants.</p>
            <p eId="para_871"> Will the Minister of State outline the number of determination orders issued in recent years? How many such orders which have not been complied with has the PRTB had enforced through the courts? If the Minister of State does not have this information to hand, I would appreciate if he could ensure it is forwarded to me. I understand that in 2011 the PRTB obtained 54 judgments against non-compliant parties and that a further 25 cases were settled out of court. The board also issued over 10,000 notices under the 2004 Act in which it warned people about being prosecuted for non-compliance. I would like to be provided with an update on this matter. Will the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government consider providing the PRTB with better resources in order that it might enforce its orders? The board has indicated that it received 587 requests for enforcement in 2011 and that, with additional resources, it was able to deal with 150 cases in the first quarter of 2012 alone. There is no doubt that it requires extra resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_872"> The landlords to whom I refer are obeying the law, they are registered with the PRTB and they pay all the charges - property tax and everything else - they are supposed to pay. Quite often, however, they are being left in limbo as a result of the actions of a small number of tenants from hell who will not comply and who ignore all requests for them to do so. It takes landlords for ever to get anyone to take action in respect of such individuals. This is a serious matter and it relates to law-abiding people, many of whom have families, who have made an investment, perhaps for their retirement. I would appreciate a response to my concerns.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_873">I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this issue, which I have come across in the course of my work as a Deputy and a Minister of State. The Deputy is correct: there are issues which affect those on both sides. It is important that we send out the message at all times that the PRTB is there to achieve the right result and that it is not there to favour tenants or landlords.</p>
            <p eId="para_874"> I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coffey, who cannot be present. The PRTB was established under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to operate a tenancy registration system and resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. The PRTB replaces the courts for the vast majority of landlord and tenant disputes. For a fee of €25, parties to a dispute can apply to it for mediation or adjudication services. If either of the parties to a dispute is unhappy with the decision of an adjudicator, they can appeal it to the tenancy tribunal within 21 days of the date of receiving the decision. An adjudication decision that is not appealed to the tribunal within 21 days will become a binding determination order of the PRTB. In instances of non-compliance, parties can request enforcement of such orders through the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_875"> Demand for the PRTB's services has increased significantly in recent years, reflecting the sizable growth in the private rented sector. The sector doubled in size in the 2006 to 2011 inter-census period, from 9.5% to 19.5% of the overall residential market. Census 2011 recorded 308,750 households in the private rented sector. This has driven a sustained increase in demand for the PRTB's services. In that context, dispute services have increased by 73% since 2008, when 1,650 requests for dispute resolution were received. In 2013 some 2,861 such requests were received. This is a sizeable increase. Enforcement requests have increased by 305% since 2008. There were some 100 requests in that year compared to 405 in 2013. Tenancy registration has increased from 206,054 in 2008 to 282,918 in 2013, a rise of 37%. The Deputy requested some other figures which I do not have in my possession. However, I will obtain the relevant information, if possible, and forward it to him shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_876"> The board has responded to the challenges presented by the increased demand to which I refer by pursuing a programme of outsourcing, shared services and improved ICT systems. An online registration system was launched in November 2010 and online dispute management services were introduced in 2012. The outsourcing of the registration function at the end of 2012 has allowed the PRTB to focus on its quasi-judicial processes - adjudication, mediation and tribunals - and on the enforcement of registration and determination orders. I will also obtain the figures relating to determination orders for the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">In addition to these efficiency measures, legislative changes are in train in support of the work of the PRTB. Among the main issues addressed by the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, currently before the Seanad, are the separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the PRTB and the delivery of the programme for Government commitment to establish a deposit protection scheme. The Minister is confident that these legislative changes will allow the board to continue to discharge its statutory obligations in an independent, fair and efficient manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_878"> The Deputy also raised the issue of the timelines. The PRTB reduced the average adjudication time from some 18 months in 2008 to seven months in 2013, and we understand that the time has been reduced further in 2014. I accept that the timeline is not short enough in some cases but it is certainly improving a lot.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_879">I thank the Minister of State for his response. I understand tenants are obliged to continue to pay rent while awaiting a decision under the dispute resolution process. However, I have come across many cases where they do not, and landlords feel the seriousness of this matter is not being accounted for at the hearings. Determination orders are issued as a result of the dispute resolution process. However, this does not really improve the situation for landlords as tenants often ignore them. The PRTB can, by law, enforce the determination orders in court but it is not obliged to. Where does that leave the landlord? This is a major problem for some landlords who have approached me in recent years. It is open to landlords to take the tenants to the Circuit Court for not complying, but this can be very costly, and can range from €5,000 to €10,000. Therefore, many landlords cannot afford it. The tenant may be in arrears, thereby complicating the issue. As I stated, 70% of landlords have loans.</p>
            <p eId="para_880"> The figures the Minister of State outlined show just how much we are depending on the private rental sector for housing. I have come across a number of landlords who say they are very annoyed and upset and having sleepless nights over circumstances like these. They are thinking of getting out of the sector altogether as it does not pay and is not worth the hassle, trouble and stress. If the landlord makes one mistake, he can find himself before the courts or subject to a serious fine. The PRTB interprets the regulations for notice extremely strictly. I came across one case where the notice was texted and handed in the door two days later. It was deemed that the written notice was not given in the right timeline so the whole case went into limbo after that.</p>
            <p eId="para_881"> This is a serious matter. There are devils on both sides of the argument but the fact that landlords who are paying the property tax and other charges are being left in limbo is not being addressed. The process should be speeded up dramatically, as in New Zealand.</p>

            <p eId="para_882">I will bring the Deputy's concerns to the Minister and discuss the matter with him. The Deputy raised some very important issues. Some tenants believe they have all the rights but no responsibilities, and the Deputy is correct in that regard. We must ensure responsibilities are met on both sides.</p>
            <p eId="para_883"> There are rogue landlords but this has been addressed significantly in recent years and the PRTB has helped in this regard. Certainly, it is matter of getting the right balance. The Deputy is correct that we are currently very heavily dependent on private landlords. We will need them in the years ahead, even given the announcements yesterday. There is significant reliance on the private rental sector, which needs to be encouraged, but those concerned need to be protected also. I will certainly raise with the Minister the issues raised by the Deputy and ensure he gets a response.</p>

          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_475">
            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_884">I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for coming to the House to respond to this debate. I do not need to tell him that we have very serious problems in Ireland with substance misuse. Obviously, the number one problem is alcohol but all the evidence indicates that the number two problem is the misuse of prescription drugs, particularly benzodiazepines and Z-drugs. Vast quantities of prescription drugs are available on our streets. We have all seen the effect of this in Dublin city centre, in particular, and the serious anti-social activity that goes with it. Street trading and related activity are clearly very intimidating for the public. This behaviour undermines the efforts of health professionals to find a long-term path to recovery for those people who are using drugs. Of course, the practice is damaging to businesses and tourism in the city centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_885"> There are two principal sources for the prescription drugs. One is the over-prescribing of them in our health service and the second is uncontrolled imports. The current law is very weak in both of these respects. Obviously, benzodiazepines have a very important role to play in the treatment of people with mental health issues but the figures show that, by European standards, we have prescribing rates that are much higher than average. When it comes to imports, in many respects the hands of the Garda and customs officials are tied because of inadequate legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_886"> Almost two years ago, when I was in the Department of Health, I initiated a renewed focus on the problem of the overuse of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs. A number of measures were initiated, including a project where the PCRS tracked the prescribing patterns of general practitioners. There was intervention among general practitioners whose prescribing pattern was particularly out of kilter with the pattern among the rest of the general practitioner population. A review of the regulations under the misuse of drugs legislation was initiated and provided several measures to help curtail the availability of the drugs on our streets. These measures included new import and export controls, new possession offences and stricter prescribing and dispensing requirements. The Department conducted consultations with interest groups in the summer of 2012 and took on board any issues raised. The Department amended its plans to reflect this process. Preliminary draft regulations were shown to me before I left office in September of 2012. However, for some reason it took an entire year thereafter for a draft set of regulations to be published on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_887"> Over three years ago, the projected date for the completion of the new regulations was the following January. Now, two years later, according to replies to recent parliamentary questions, the date is still next January. It is not clear to me what exactly is holding up the regulations at this stage. The unit dealing with this legislation was among the best in the Department in my experience so I cannot believe the fault lies there. Other senior officials should be well aware of the problem. It is not unknown for these prescription drugs to be traded right outside the front door of the Department on Hawkins Street. The Minister may even have seen this occurring himself.</p>
            <p eId="para_888"> This is a serious drug problem that can be dealt with effectively. The Government is now two years late with the necessary legislation and it is time this was made a top priority in the Department. I hope the Minister will make it so.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_476">
            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Leo Varadkar)<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_889">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Benzodiazepines are a class of medicine available on prescription which are commonly used to treat anxiety, sleep disturbance and insomnia. They are known to be associated with dependence and withdrawal symptoms and consequently are primarily recommended for short-term treatment only. They are a very valuable treatment option when used correctly. However, there is increasing evidence of the inappropriate use of benzodiazepines in Europe, a problem which is not particular to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_890"> Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is an offence for a person, except where the person is a pharmacist or working under the personal supervision of a pharmacist, to supply a prescription medicine. These regulations also make it illegal for prescription medicines to be supplied by mail order or over the Internet. Additional levels of control are applied to medicines which have a high potential to be misused by means of regulations made under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. These regulations impose restrictions on the production, supply, importation and exportation of controlled drugs, such as morphine, methadone, amphetamines and benzodiazepines. A person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a drug controlled under the misuse of drugs legislation for unauthorised sale or supply is guilty of an offence under that legislation. Different levels of control apply to drugs controlled under the misuse of drugs legislation, dependent on their therapeutic value and potential for abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_891"> The Department has been reviewing the misuse of drugs regulations to introduce stricter controls on benzodiazepines. In particular, it is proposed to apply formal import and export controls on benzodiazepines, thereby making it an offence for a person to import or export these drugs without a licence. The introduction of these controls will also provide comprehensive national information on the level of use of benzodiazepines and trade in benzodiazepines. It is also proposed to introduce stricter prescribing and dispensing controls for benzodiazepines, as well as an offence for a person to possess benzodiazepines without entitlement - for example, a prescription - thereby assisting the Garda and customs service in enforcing the law on the illicit importation of and dealing in benzodiazepines.</p>
            <p eId="para_892"> Following a consultation process, a draft amendment regulation was prepared and made available for further consultation on the Department's website. Submissions were received from a wide range of organisations and individuals, including doctors, pharmacists, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Irish Pharmacy Union, private and public hospitals - both from medical practitioners and pharmacists - nursing homes, drug treatment centres and experts in addiction services.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">These submissions raised a number of legislative issues which require further consideration before finalising the amendments. The process is taking longer than anticipated because it is a complex and technical body of work. Some further work is required and the objective is to finalise the text of the draft regulations early next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_894"> Once the draft regulations are ready, they will be subject to a three month EU notification period under the technical standards directive before they can be signed into law. This is because of the implications of the proposed regulatory changes on trade in pharmaceutical products.</p>
            <p eId="para_895"> No doubt the scale and nature of the drug problem in Ireland is constantly evolving. The emergence of new psychoactive substances, the increased strength of cannabis and the prevalence of poly-drug use represent serious challenges for our services in responding to the needs of vulnerable groups. The response of the HSE has involved the reorientation of its addiction services in order to develop a comprehensive integrated addiction treatment service capable of dealing with all substances. The HSE continues to co-operate with local community representatives, particularly in the Dublin city centre area, and liaise with local gardaí to minimise any negative public order issues that may arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_896">The Minister's response is disappointing. There is no sense of urgency at all from him in this regard. This is a major problem across the country but most prevalent in the Dublin city centre area. The Minister will get that feedback from all of the local drugs task forces as well. Prescription drugs, after alcohol, are the biggest problem that communities are dealing with.</p>
            <p eId="para_897"> One would have to ask why no action is being taken on this. This is at the same stage as it was at two years ago. The draft regulations were almost ready to go in January 2013. Here we are, almost two years later, and the issue does not seem to have moved on at all. Is there a problem with resources in the Department? Is the Minister allocating staff? Is Deputy Varadkar personally saying to his staff that he wants this to be a priority? It is a priority for everybody else working in this area. It is certainly a priority from the point of view of the gardaí. The law is too weak for them to tackle the problem in an effective way.</p>
            <p eId="para_898"> One must ask if there are vested interests coming into play here. Why is it that the Minister is not tackling the problem? It is in his hands to do something effective about this problem and yet it does not seem to be given any priority. There was a report in 2002 which was left to gather dust and my concern is that the same will happen with these draft regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_899"> The solution is largely in the Minister's hands. I am appealing to him to take this issue seriously. It is devastating a lot of lives and is causing a lot of problems. It is in Deputy Varadkar's hands to make a meaningful difference to the problem and I ask him to act on it as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_905">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and thank the Minister for attending here in person for this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_906"> This relates to a special school in my constituency, St. Francis's special school in Beaufort, which mostly serves mid-Kerry, but there are children coming to that school from Kenmare and from as far away as Castleisland. The 52 children who attend there have high dependence needs and require specialised care. The problems arose last year when the services were reconfigured. The various multidisciplinary services that are required there, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy, were delivered by an on-site team and the changes meant that there would be professionals coming in from outside delivering the services. The reconfiguration process for the school was an unmitigated disaster. I have attended a number of public meetings there and have engaged with parents on a regular basis over the past nine months on this, and have met with HSE officials in the county about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_907"> While the situation has improved somewhat of late in regard to the allocation of hours and the time being spent in the school by the professionals concerned, at the same time the difference in terms of the overall amount of service available to the children compared to what used to be there is far too great and the children who need help are not getting enough help. To compound matters, in the past number of months The Arches, the adjacent respite centre which was available for parents to bring their children to for respite purposes, is no longer available because of various problems that have been encountered by those delivering the services locally. Ultimately, it means there is no respite service available for those who previously would have used this service.</p>
            <p eId="para_908"> An alternative facility, the Home from Home facility in Ballydowney in Killarney, which provides an excellent service, has approached the HSE and indicated that it is willing to make its physical facility available should the HSE take up the offer and resource the facility with the required staff to provide the valuable and needed respite service, and I hope that this can be done. Locally, the HSE tells me that there is a problem with The Arches respite centre and the HSE is trying to get that sorted out. Ultimately, the children are suffering. Their parents are also suffering. In one family from Kenmare that I am aware of, a parent of a child with high dependency needs had to be hospitalised leaving the other parent alone to take care of that child. That parent is under enormous pressure and has no respite option at all. I understand the parent was given one night of respite. It is not good enough. We need to grab the bull by the horns here and address this for the sake of everyone involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_909"> I ask the Minister to look at the reconfiguration process and see where it has fallen down, particularly in this instance for this special school. I ask him to consider the broader element of the reconfiguration process but, more specifically in this case, if he could tackle the problem we have with the need for urgent respite care and extra multidisciplinary services for these children.</p>

            <p eId="para_910">I thank Deputy Griffin for raising this matter. I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is on departmental business elsewhere. I assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to the ongoing delivery of vital services and supports to children with disabilities to the greatest extent possible within available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_911"> The HSE has recognised that it needs to improve the way in which its early intervention services and services for school-aged children operate. To this end, it is currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multidisciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people, from infancy to 18 years. The key objective of this programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery. There should be a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, where these children go to school or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_912"> These service improvements are a key priority for the HSE's social care directorate. An additional €4 million was allocated this year to assist with this programme. This equates to approximately 80 additional therapy posts. Further investment in the programme will take place in 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_913"> The programme is already at an advanced stage in County Kerry. Since October 2013, children's disability services in Kerry have been reconfigured into four geographically-based teams for children and young people with complex needs. The reconfigured Kerry Intervention &amp; Disability Services, KIDS, is a partnership among the HSE South, the Brothers of Charity, Enable Ireland and St. John of God Children Services.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">Each team provides a range of multidisciplinary services, including psychology, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, social work, preschool and family support services.</p>
            <p eId="para_915"> The transition to the new service arrangement was carefully planned over a two year period. It included consultation with the relevant service providers and parent representatives. The four teams in County Kerry were also allocated four additional therapy posts in 2014, which will further strengthen service delivery in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_916"> St. Francis special school in Beaufort falls within the remit of the KIDS mid-Kerry team. This new team will deliver services in keeping with the new service model. Interventions will be delivered in way that is fair to all children and families within the geographical area on the basis of prioritised need. I have been assured the team will continue to work closely with staff and parents in planning and delivering a service for the children attending St. Francis special school.</p>
            <p eId="para_917"> The issue of respite care places at The Arches which is operated by the St. John of God services was also raised. I understand the provision of this service has been somewhat constrained as a result of the challenging behaviour of a resident. I have been assured steps are being taken which should resolve the matter in the coming weeks. Once resolved, The Arches will be able to offer an enhanced service to children.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Griffin<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_918">I thank the Minister and appreciate his response. The HSE has responded to me about The Arches and the difficulty with a particular resident. However, one difficult resident should not prevent everyone else from being able to use the service. Perhaps the Minister might liaise with the HSE to bring about a more speedy resolution of the problem. A few weeks is a very long time to wait for respite care for the parent of a child with moderate or profound special needs. Perhaps the Minister might use his good offices to try to speed up a resolution of the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_919"> Will the Minister ask the HSE to liaise with the Home from Home service to see whether there is a possibility of providing extra respite care places through its facilities? The service does fantastic work while operating on a shoestring budget. The option should be explored to see whether more places could be provided in a cost-effective manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_920"> On the reconfiguration process in general, I received an e-mail from a parent which I will not read because, unfortunately, I do not have the time to do so. The parent who wrote it is very frustrated and calls it as she sees it. She accepts that the reconfiguration might have merit in the overall scheme of things, but it has not worked in the case of St. Francis special school where it has resulted in a serious depletion of services. I acknowledge that there were serious teething problems at the start and that there were difficulties with staffing. I appreciate the provision of extra resources and the four additional posts sanctioned in County Kerry for which I lobbied. I am grateful that they have been provided, but that said, it does not seem to be enough to have the level of service required in the school in question and the matter must be revisited for the sake of the children. Will the Minister revisit the issue and examine the level of service being provided in the facility because clearly it is not enough and the children deserve better?</p>

            <p eId="para_921">In theory, these things should not happen, but in reality they do and often one difficult individual can cause problems for an entire service. I do not have detailed personal knowledge of or involvement in the case, as the matter comes under the disability and social care directorate of the HSE, for which political responsibility lies with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. I will certainly make her aware of the Deputy's concerns and the fact that he has raised the matter in the Chamber which indicates the importance of the issue for him and others in County Kerry.</p>

            <p eId="para_922">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for discussion in the Topical Issue debate. I also thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_923"> I am raising this issue on behalf of a constituent, Mr. Paddy Mooney, with his consent. He is in his late 70s and on a waiting list for a knee replacement operation at Cappagh Hospital since earlier this year. He contacted my office in September and his case illustrates those of many others who have been awaiting hip and knee joint replacement surgery at Cappagh Hospital for some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_924"> I wrote to Cappagh Hospital at my constituent's request to find out when he could expect to have the knee replacement procedure carried out. I received the following reply which I will read with the consent of my constituent and the consultant orthopaedic surgeon who wrote it. It is addressed to me and from the department of trauma and orthopaedic surgery, Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown. It reads:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_925">Dear Mr. Kenny,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_926">Mr. Mooney urgently needs to have a knee replacement at Cappagh Hospital. Unfortunately, due to Government policy the financial situation at Cappagh orthopaedic hospital is dire. I am not allowed to do the amount of work that I would like to do, and in fact Cappagh Hospital is severely restricted in the amount of operations it can do. In Cappagh we have seven operating theatres. Currently, only two of these operating theatres work per day and, usually only for half a day. Cappagh Hospital is functioning to about 15% to 20% of its capacity.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_927"> If you can arrange through your contacts in government to alleviate this situation, I would be glad to be able to get Mr. Mooney's operation done much quicker. Currently, there are over 200 patients on my waiting list for joint replacement surgery, meaning that my waiting list is well over a year.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_928">Yours Sincerely,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_929">Mr. Paddy Kenny, consultant orthopaedic surgeon.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">I subsequently spoke by telephone to Mr. Kenny who reaffirmed the contents of his letter. He later took part in a radio programme, "Liveline" with Joe Duffy, on 10 October. On air, he described the situation at Cappagh Hospital, where on a day-to-day basis usually only two of the seven operating theatres were in use, although he maintained there were enough consultants available to ensure all seven could be fully utilised. He went on to say 24 orthopaedic surgeons were available in the hospital but asserted that owing to a lack of finance sufficient nursing staff were not available to operate all seven operating theatres on a daily basis. He added that hip and knee implants cost on average between €1,800 and €2,000 per implant. He further stated he personally could carry out four to five implant procedures per day if he had the resources to do so and added that he had 198 patients on his waiting list and that the waiting time was 15 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_931"> A number of listeners telephoned the programme on the day to describe their situation and the level of pain they were enduring while awaiting a hip or knee operation. I have personal experience, as I had to undergo a knee replacement operation some years ago. Accordingly, I can empathise with others in the same position. I was lucky enough to have health insurance and able to have the procedure carried out within a couple of months. I can only imagine the pain a person must endure if they have to wait for 15 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_932"> I understand the HSE service plan for 2015 was launched today. I will be pleased to learn from the Minister if the situation at Cappagh Hospital will be addressed in 2015.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_487" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2014-11-27T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_933">Long ago when I was involved in clinical practice, I used to take great pleasure in writing such letters to politicians, including to the former Taoiseach, one Bertie Ahern. I am pleased to see the practice has not been discontinued. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and for giving me an opportunity to outline to the House the current position on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_934"> Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital is a major elective orthopaedic facility which provides a national secondary and tertiary referral service for orthopaedic care for adults and children, including the national bone tumour surgical service. There has been a significant increase, 40%, in the number of referrals to Cappagh Hospital this year. The level of increase has not been observed at other sites and the factors for the increase in referrals are being investigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_935"> I had the opportunity to meet representatives of Cappagh Hospital yesterday, including the CEO, the chairman, the medical secretary and the medical director, and hear from them first-hand about the challenges faced by the hospital this year. The cumulative effect of a reduced orthopaedic revenue allocation, the cessation of National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, funding and a reduction in private insurance income in 2014 has limited the surgical capability.</p>
            <p eId="para_936"> Cappagh Hospital has a total of seven operating theatres. However, while there are sufficient consultant staff available to provide services to meet demand requirements, not all theatres have been in use in 2014. As the Deputy outlined, between two and four theatres have been in use. This is a factor of both the need to manage activity levels within the financial capability and the availability of suitably qualified theatre nursing staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_937"> In terms of access, urgent patients continue to be prioritised and Cappagh Hospital has advised that owing to strict chronological booking policies, all patients attending the hospital are being offered dates for surgery based on their waiting time for surgery having due regard to clinical categorisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">The HSE has been in active engagement with Cappagh Hospital this year regarding its finances and to examine and agree options for optimising the available theatre resources and to ensure patients have timely access. The HSE recently facilitated €800,000 in additional funding to enable Cappagh Hospital to treat 102 patients from the waiting list in Cavan General Hospital. This will also facilitate treatment for some additional Cappagh Hospital patients. Funding has also been provided this year for 43 active rehabilitation beds at Cappagh and I understand this initiative has worked very well.</p>
            <p eId="para_939"> I have also been advised that, while challenges remain in relation to inpatient access targets, day case and outpatient 2014 target levels will be achieved this year. For 2015, I understand the HSE will continue to engage with the hospital regarding its budget and to explore mechanisms to ensure optimal use of resources, including theatre capacity, at the hospital within the overall resources available to the acute sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_940"> The Deputy will also be aware that Cappagh Hospital is part of the Ireland East hospital group, which includes the Mater; St. Vincent's University Hospital; Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar; St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny; Wexford General Hospital; National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street; Our Lady's Hospital, Navan; St Columcille's Hospital; St Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire; and the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_941"> I am confident there will be a structured integration of Cappagh Hospital into the Ireland East hospital group in 2015 and that this will provide opportunities and support for Cappagh Hospital in managing demand and delivering high quality, safe patient care in a cost-effective manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_942">I thank the Minister. I note the Minister used to write letters similar to that written by Mr. Paddy Kenny. I note the Minister's hope that a re-organisation of the hospital system will produce a better result. However, the people on the waiting list tend to be older people who need knee and hip replacement surgery. If they have to be on a waiting list for more than a year they will be suffering from pain and trauma. My constituent tells me that he has difficulty walking to the shops and his condition is getting worse. A person should not have to endure that kind of pain in their older years. Such cases should be prioritised.</p>
            <p eId="para_943"> Is there a particular problem in Cappagh Hospital not replicated anywhere else? If such a problem can be addressed would it mean that the waiting time of 15 months could be reduced? The Minister referred to other hospitals in his reply. Would it be possible to send patients to another hospital for the same orthopaedic surgery? Is that an option for patients?</p>
          </speech>

            <p eId="para_944">There is not a particular problem in Cappagh Hospital. It is a very well run and well managed hospital. Ironically, in some ways the hospital demonstrates the consequences of coming in on budget. The hospital does not have an accident and emergency department and therefore, no emergency admissions and as a result the hospital can plan its activities precisely every year. The hospital has come in on budget every year and it has almost no agency staff. However, the consequence is that the hospital has had to cut back activity very considerably and this is the cause of the problem highlighted by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_945"> In the HSE service plan published earlier today provision is made for an increase in the number of day cases and day surgery by 20,000 next year. It is intended within the budget of €4 billion for hospitals to provide an increase in the budget for Cappagh Hospital next year so it can begin to ramp up activity. It is hoped this will show results next year in terms of people like the Deputy's constituent and many of mine experiencing shorter waiting lists. The difficulty we have is that as our population ages, the demand for orthopaedic surgery keeps increasing and the budget is not increasing adequately to meet that demand. The situation will be alleviated next year when there will be more money for Cappagh Hospital to carry out these operations, but not enough unfortunately.</p>
