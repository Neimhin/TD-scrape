          <p eId="para_1">I want to ask the Taoiseach about children's services.  I understand there are 7,000 children in north Dublin waiting more than 12 months for an eye test.  Recent official figures show there are more than 1,000 children waiting a very long period for psychiatric assessments.  Data provided by the HSE to the Joint Committee on Health and Children show that children are waiting up to four years for orthodontic treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">If government is about anything, it is about making decisions that affect people's lives and that can improve the environment for everybody.  Yesterday we heard the mother of a six year old autistic child talking on national television about the Educate Together school in Castleknock that has not been open for 12 months.  The reason is the row between the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Science because of the embargo on recruitment for occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and behavioural therapy.  Yet the six advisers to the Minister for Health and Children cost €666,000 a year.  The mother of this child does not mind who provides the service so long as her child receives it.  This school, and its autism unit, cannot open without the appointment of the specialists, who are contracted to the HSE and not the Department of Education and Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">If government is about any type of leadership, surely the Taoiseach should be in a position to have this row sorted out today and to make this facility, for which the taxpayer has paid, available to provide the services for which it was intended.</p>

          <p eId="para_5">What will the Taoiseach do about this?  Will he call in the Minister for Health and Children and say that this matter must be sorted out with the HSE?  There are specialists available for recruitment but they cannot be appointed because of this embargo.  Mrs. Murphy stated: "If anybody were to come out to my house and see what I have to deal with now because my child cannot get these specialist services".  What will the Taoiseach do about it?  Will he give the Dáil a guarantee that he will take a personal interest in this and sort out the row which is between two Departments, headed by two Ministers who seem to be at loggerheads over this matter?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_7">On the Deputy's first point, every year, last year being no exception, we have increased resources, consultant posts, nursing posts and other medical posts to alleviate the waiting lists for particular children right across the hospital system, whether in orthodontic, ophthalmic or any of the other specialties.  A large part of the resources every year has gone into alleviating the position for children.  That has proved itself.  In areas where there are difficulties, the national treatment purchase fund has also been used to alleviate the situation.  It is quite a costly system but it allows us to use private facilities to reduce the waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">I have several points to make on the Castleknock position, which was brought to my attention in recent days.  There are 277 of these schools around the country and all of them have teaching staff, resources staff and special needs assistants, but not all of them have multidisciplinary teams.  The board of management in this case, which, as it runs the school, is entitled to take the decision, has stated its intention not to open the school unless this multidisciplinary team is in place.  The children are attending other schools further away from their homes in the immediate area.  It is not that they are out of school but they would be facilitated far better if they were in the local area.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">The school was supplied with a new high quality school building, including a purpose built autism unit.  The teachers and special needs assistants have been sanctioned for the special school.  I understand the school has taken the view that until it receives funding from the HSE for the therapies, it will not open.  The view is that the school should open the unit without delay while the work goes on with the HSE to organise the therapy provision rather than leave the children in the other schools.  However, the board of management is entitled to take the position it has taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">It is not the case that there is an embargo on recruitment.  Almost 4,000 staff were taken on last year by the HSE and its budget for this year has increased by €1 billion.  The board of management of this school obviously has demands and issues to deal with but the HSE is working to improve access to speech and language and occupational therapy throughout the country.  The Minister of State, Deputy Devins, has been working with the Department of Education and Science to co-ordinate the provision of such therapies.  Members will recall that the number of places in the relevant universities and institutes of technology has been expanded over recent years to increase the supply of therapists coming out of third level education.  There has traditionally been a shortage of speech and language therapists.  I appreciate the importance of various forms of therapy to children with special needs, but I do not think they should be denied an education in a purpose-built unit in the meantime.  I have asked the Ministers concerned to do their best to resolve this issue in conjunction with the HSE.</p>

          <p eId="para_16">I hope that is actually taken to a conclusion in the shortest possible time, so that this unit can actually open.  Deputy Brian Hayes proposed a motion on autism on behalf of Fine Gael last week.  It was voted on by the House.  It received the support of all Opposition Deputies and a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies.  Unfortunately, the latter group did not have the courage to vote against the Government on the motion, about which they felt strongly.  One Fianna Fáil Deputy has become a reluctant heroine as a result.  People do not seem to want to recognise the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I could introduce the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, to a parent who has spent €250,000 on replacing the furniture in her house.  The woman in question faces difficulties and challenges in respect of her child.  The Minister said yesterday that the education of each child is important.  That is true and I agree.  However, one cannot require parents to send their children to schools which do not have the facilities to deal with them and the specialist educationalists to give them the education to which they are properly entitled.  It is as if the Minister is saying "let them go to school, let them have an education — that is going to be good enough for them".  It is not good enough for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">That is the point.  It is not good enough for them.  It is appalling that the Minister for Education and Science is saying "let them go to school, let them have an education — they will be all right".  As autism is an intellectual disability, the specialists dealing with it should be contracted to the Department of Education and Science.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">People with autism have an educational need, rather than a medical need.  If the change I have proposed were made, there would be no row with the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  At present, some people cannot be appointed to do the jobs for which they have been properly trained.  The Taoiseach should take a personal interest in sorting out this problem.  He should treat what the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, has said with a degree of scepticism — take it with a pinch of salt.  It is not just a question of "send them to school, they will get an education — they will be all right".  It is the duty of the State, under the Constitution, to ensure that children are given the best opportunities.  If that requires specialist education and specialist facilities, it is the duty of the Government to ensure that happens.  Parents should not have to spend €250,000 on their children.  They should not be dragged through the courts to defend the right of their children to access the education to which they are properly entitled, at a time when the Minister for Health and Children's six advisers are costing €666,000 per annum.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">A number of points have been made.  I think I have explained the Castleknock issue.  There is no need to go back to that.  The issue has to be resolved.  I do not want to repeat all the points and arguments which were made when the issue of children's needs was raised a few weeks ago.  I referred on that occasion to international advice on the best way of dealing with autism and how we should deal with it.  We are providing enormous resources in this area and rightly so.  Autism is a huge problem, difficulty and challenge for any family.  Every Member of this House has seen it at first hand.  We are familiar with the consequences of autism.  It was not recognised until the last decade, but that is part of history now.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Funding for ten hours of home tuition per week is available for children with autism who are under the age of three.  Funding for 20 hours a week is available after such children have reached that age.  Some 23 pre-schools for children with autism have been established.  The Department funds home tuition for children aged six or more who are encountering difficulties in securing appropriate educational placements.  That scheme covers some of the children mentioned by Deputy Kenny.  Approximately 30 children are in such a position.  Placements have been found for the vast majority of children with autism across the length and breadth of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Three distinct educational options are now open to autistic children of schoolgoing age.  They can be placed in ordinary classes with the support of a resource teacher or a special needs assistant, if needed.  They can be placed in a special class within a mainstream school or they can be placed in a special school.  While many children with autism can thrive in ordinary classrooms, special classes have been designed specifically to deal with the needs of children with autism who need greater levels of individual support.  In some instances, the Department believes it has provided appropriate services to a child, but his or her family does not believe that to be the case.  If the Department believes it is right, it has to defend its case.  We wish such circumstances did not arise.  The Department's belief in its position has been vindicated in most cases.  It is a pity it comes to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">I cannot let it go without mentioning that an enormous amount has happened in this area.  I know there are differences of opinion about international advice, etc.  Various Members of the House have different views.  I understand all of that.  We will see that as research changes.  As a country, we are spending huge resources — approximately €1 billion — in this area.  Those moneys are being used to employ 10,000 special needs assistants in our schools.  There were just 300 special needs assistants in this country when I became Taoiseach.  There are approximately 9,000 resource teachers in learning support positions, compared to 2,000 in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">Over the past decade, we have increased from 2,300 to 19,000 the number of people who are paid to provide services and help children with autism every day of the week.  We are extending that by multiples every year.  We have doubled the amount of money being spent in this area over the past four years.  The developments we have made in this country have been quite extraordinary.  We are prepared to continue to do that.  We will be doing it.  We will follow best international practice in the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">It emerged yesterday that a laptop containing personal information on over 170,000 people who have donated blood to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service was stolen on a street in New York earlier this month.  I have concerns about the security of personal information supplied by people to Government bodies and State agencies.  This is not the first time personal information of this nature has been lost.  We discovered recently, in response to parliamentary questions tabled by my colleague, Deputy Quinn, that more than 80 laptops, desktops or blackberries have been stolen from, or lost by, Departments over the past five years.  There was considerable controversy in the United Kingdom late last year when a computer disk, on which personal information about 25 million people was stored, was lost.  At that time, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner stated that there was no guarantee that something similar could not happen here.  When people supply personal information to a State agency, it is reasonable for them to have confidence that it will be kept securely.  The information supplied to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service can be quite sensitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">I would like to ask the Taoiseach a couple of questions.  What was the extent of the information on the laptop that was stolen in New York?  I understand that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service has written to the people concerned.  We should be given details about the extent of the information stored on the laptop.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to undertake a full audit of the security procedures and measures which are in place to govern the protection of personal information that is supplied to Departments?  We need to have a full overview of the security in place so that when information is supplied by people to Departments, which they believe is supplied on a confidential basis, it is not open to theft or being accessed by criminals for the purpose of identity theft or even by the staff of the agencies concerned in an unauthorised way.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">The Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, has given me a report on the incident.  The IBTS entered into an agreement with the New York Blood Centre, NYBC, for the provision of a data query tool last October.  The purpose of the data warehousing reporting tool is to improve the existing IBTS blood banking system computer, which is called Progresa.  The issue the IBTS was trying to deal with was improving its own security and service, which is why it had set up the New York agreement.  Under the terms of the agreement, the IBTS exported data on a CD from its Progresa system for the period 2 July 2007 to 11 October 2007.  The data were encrypted using a 256-bit key encryption prior to export on the CD.  The data contained details of 171,324 donor records, including name, address, date of birth, gender, blood group and contact telephone number.  The CD holding the records was handed over to personnel of the NYBC in Ireland during the week beginning 3 December last and it is retained by the NYBC in a physically secure environment.  No data stored on the encryption volume can be read or decrypted without using the correct password, key files or encryption keys.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">The IBTS and the NYBC consider that the risk of any person being in a position to bypass the password controls and decrypt the data is extremely remote.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">On the evening of 7 February, an NYBC staff member was mugged outside his home in New York and the laptop issued to him by the centre containing these encrypted files was stolen.  While the police have been notified and an investigation into the robbery is ongoing, the laptop has not been recovered.  The IBTS and the NYBC are very concerned about the theft and the IBTS informed the Data Protection Commissioner on 11 February about the matter.  The IBTS is writing to each donor affected on 22 February to reassure them and to advise them of the possibility, however remote, that personal data might be accessed.  It is also writing to general practitioners and hospitals who will, in turn, contact the patients concerned.  I am also informed that an information line has been set up for anyone with concerns.  The number is 1850731137.  The IBTS also advises it would be glad of the opportunity to brief interested Deputies and representatives will make themselves available today at a suitable time to be arranged with the Minister for Health and Children.  They will brief any Member with questions or concerns.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  One of our concerns must be to ensure continuing confidence in the blood bank so that people do not withhold donating blood as a result of this.  It is ironic that the IBTS set out to seek help in securing the information only to end up with somebody walking around with it on a laptop on a street in New York where it ended up being stolen.  There is something incredibly sloppy about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">I refer to the second part of my question.  Unfortunately, this incident is not a one off, as there have been other thefts of computer equipment, disks and so on from Departments.  Deputy Shortall tabled questions to the Department of Social and Family Affairs about the unauthorised accessing of personal information by staff.  One prominent case occurred in recent times.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Data Protection Commissioner to undertake a full review of the security arrangements surrounding personal information supplied to Departments, which is held electronically?  There is a necessity to restore people's confidence that the information they are supplying to Departments will not be accessed, lost or carried around on a disk or a laptop by staff of an agency on the streets of Dublin or New York and that the dangers of personal information getting into the hands of criminals or others and the dangers associated with identity theft will be minimised.  Serious attention needs to be given to this issue and the way to proceed is to ask the Data Protection Commissioner, in the first instance, to conduct a full audit of security measures, make a report and for the Government to take whatever necessary action needs to be taken to increase security and to protect people's identities.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">In fairness to the staff of the IBTS, they were conscious that the service's blood banking computer system required improvement and they set out to do that.   They went to where they had been advised were the best records in the world.  What happened was unfortunate but these things happen.  Everyone will say one can hack into anything nowadays——</p>

          <p eId="para_39">——but the IBTS and the NYBC strongly believe this is an extremely remote possibility.  However, they will take all the necessary precautions.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that the credibility of the system and the security of the data of people who give blood are important.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">Public service bodies, as well as other organisations or individuals who hold personal data, are subject to the requirements of the Data Protection Acts, 1998 and 2003, which provide for the appropriate compilation, storage and use of such data.  Among the requirements placed on organisations and individuals regarding the management of personal data is the need to keep it secure against unauthorised access.  The specific statute provision is as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_41">A data controller shall, as respects personal data kept by him or her, comply with the following provisions:. . .(<i>d</i>) appropriate security measures shall be taken against unauthorised access to, or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of, the data, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">Organisations and individuals that hold personal data have to register with the Data Protection Commissioner.  This registration gives the details of the type of personal data held.  That applies to all organisations, which must designate a data controller who will have statutory responsibility and ensure compliance by the organisations with the Acts.  Many laws and regulations cover unauthorised disclosure and fines on indictment are set out in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">The Deputy referred to individual Departments.  I have seen parliamentary questions and replies over the past two weeks from all Departments about security and data.  Those replies should be on the record of the House.  The Deputy also asked for the Data Protection Commissioner to examine this issue and I will bring that to his attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_218">The Taoiseach has rehearsed that reply on several occasions.  Does he have a view on whether the time has come to review the charges for freedom of information requests, which appear to be a significant factor in people deciding against submitting requests?  Is there any intention of reconsidering the question or am I to grow tired asking it?</p>
            <p eId="para_219">Does the Taoiseach wish to comment on the freedom of information released by the Department of Finance which revealed that an acquaintance of his, a gentlemen by the name of Mr. Turner, claimed that he received tacit approval from the Taoiseach for the construction of a major project in the Phoenix Park.  I am aware the issue does not strictly concern the Department of the Taoiseach but he may wish to comment.</p>
            <p eId="para_220">Arising from his reply to Deputy Gilmore, can we find out when the Minister for Health and Children was made aware of the theft of the laptop in the United States?  I am aware the matter does not directly concern the Taoiseach's Department.</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_29">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_221">The dates I gave on that issue were the dates I got from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  I would say the Department of Health and Children was informed at the same time.  In fairness to the organisation, it acted promptly.  It is clearly concerned about its own security and credibility and the importance of the good work it does.  It has been very careful.  Its representatives have said they would be happy today to answer questions.  To the best of my knowledge, the organisation worked promptly and speedily to deal with the issue because of its importance.</p>
            <p eId="para_222">As Deputy Kenny said, I answered this question on numerous occasions.  The fees are a matter for the Minister for Finance, who has made clear that he has no plans to review them.  The prices have not changed for the past five years and I do not think he is reviewing them upwards.  The current system was introduced almost exactly five years ago.  At €15, the fee is modest, particularly when compared with the estimated average cost of processing freedom of information applications, which was €425 at the time.  The cost has not remained at that level but has probably increased to €600.  Requests for personal data are free.  The Deputy will be glad or sad to hear that the number of requests made to my Department is drifting upwards again.  The figures were very high in the first few years and they have increased again to more than 70 compared to 45 made when the fees were first introduced.  The figures in respect of the first year or year and a half were false because people made requests about old data.  The number of requests subsequently fell to the 40 to 50 range but it has increased again to more than 70.</p>
            <p eId="para_223">On the other issue, which is not strictly relevant but in case the Deputy thinks I will not answer it, the development planned at the time minus the casino probably would have been better than what is currently on the site.  The casino was never a runner in the form proposed by Mr. Turner.  I often wonder, as a matter of interest, what would have happened if he had done what everyone else did.  We all argued at the time that we could not change the law for casinos but now we seem to have casinos all over the place even though we never changed the law, so it is an interesting point.</p>

            <p eId="para_224">Acres of slot machines were not to my liking.  Will the Taoiseach categorise the 70 claims made to his Department?  Were they made in respect of questions to the Department of the Taoiseach?  How many are personal requests from employees of the Department or are they inquiries about the Department's obligations and responsibilities?</p>

            <p eId="para_226">What is the procedure in the Department of the Taoiseach for reviewing the operation of the Freedom of Information Act?  Is there a cross-departmental process for monitoring and reviewing freedom of information requests either in place or planned?</p>
            <p eId="para_227">It is almost a year since we received the report of the Information Commissioner wherein she outlined a list of suggestions aimed at improving the operation of the Freedom of Information Act.  What view has the Taoiseach taken of some of her specific suggestions?  What was his reaction to the recommendation that fees for internal review of freedom of information decisions and appeals to her office should be brought into line with that applying in other jurisdictions, where there is either no charges or a nominal fee?  What is his position on her recommendation that such fees should be refunded in the event of a successful appeal of a decision made by a public body?</p>
            <p eId="para_228">I selected the aforementioned recommendations from the several made by the Information Commissioner, who also recommended that the Freedom of Information Act should apply to all records held by the Health and Safety Authority.  The Taoiseach will recall that the authority's enforcement records were removed from the scope of this Act in 2005.  These are very important recommendations.  What position has the Taoiseach, his Department and the Government taken in relation to the recommendations of the Information Commissioner in her report of just a year ago and will changes be introduced on foot of them?</p>

            <p eId="para_230">That is true of most of the questions asked by Deputy Ó Caoláin.  Specific recommendations about appeals, access and other issues that have been made by the Information Commissioner are for the Department of Finance and a question to that Department will elicit considerations it has on them.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">In my Department, designated senior people act as freedom of information adjudicators.  Freedom of information requests come into a central location and a designated officer circulates the information to designated persons in the various sections.  The information is supplied from the sections for co-ordination purposes and a reply is issued.  The Department does all it can to provide as much information as possible.  In my Department, only one or two areas are excluded from the archives Act of 1935 and all the other information is permissible.  If it has the information, it is provided through an individual who acts as co-ordinator.  That is how the system works.</p>
            <p eId="para_232">An issue arises with regard to cases where records either do not exist or cannot be found.  The Information Commissioner made a number of recommendations that are relevant to my Department and other Departments.  My Department closely follows the records management guidelines set out by the Department of Finance and has access to the services of a fully qualified archivist to advise on all aspects of records management.  Of a total of 1,274 applications, the number of cases where records could not be found stands in single figures.  When processing requests the Department follows the guidelines set out in the FOI decision makers manual.  It is seldom that the relevant officials are not able to provide the information requested, particularly if there are no barriers to such information being released.</p>

            <p eId="para_233">I appreciate the note of caution sounded by the Ceann Comhairle in respect of this matter.  Have the Taoiseach and his officials considered the recommendations of the Information Commissioner in the context of their effect on FOI <i>vis-à-vis</i> his Department?  Has an assessment been carried out in respect of the impact of the introduction or implementation of her recommendations regarding the operation of FOI within the Department?  Does the Taoiseach, as head of his Department, have a view on her recommendations regarding fee structure changes, particularly her assertion that fees be refunded in the event of a successful appeal in respect of a decision made by any public body?</p>
            <p eId="para_234">I do not believe all of these matters can be kicked to touch in the Department of Finance but I accept the Ceann Comhairle's point.  In the case of the Department of the Taoiseach, surely some consideration — even if it only amounted to a scant examination of the potential effect of the introduction of these changes — has been given to this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_235">The ninth report of the Information Commissioner is her most recent.  All of the issues relevant to my Department would have been examined by the relevant officials.  There are 18 key decision makers at assistant principal level across the divisions of my Department.  Outside of the directives issued by the Department of Finance, any of the commissioner's recommendations relating to processing, retrieval, etc., would be considered and taken into account.  Cognisance is taken at all times of the recommendations of the Information Commissioner.  That is done as a matter of course by the individuals in the Department who are involved in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_236">Deputy Kenny requested the most recent figures.  During the past year a significant majority of requests — 62% — were submitted by journalists.  Other interests account for 25%, while between 5% and 8% of applicants were Oireachtas Members.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_237">Does the Taoiseach believe that the original Freedom of Information Act, introduced on behalf of the rainbow coalition by former Minister of State and Deputy, Eithne Fitzgerald, contributed to the climate of openness in this country that has been extremely important to our economic and social development?  Does he agree that since the gutting of the Act by his Government in 2003 — pandering to senior civil servants who do not want the files to be opened — there has been, at massive cost to the public, a spiralling increase in the number of tribunals and inquiries?  To date, €1.7 billion has been paid out in respect of various inquiries.  In many cases, if people had received the necessary information, explanation, apology and, perhaps, restitution, the Government would not have been obliged to spend money at the level it has been spending it.</p>
            <p eId="para_238">If the Government had a positive approach to freedom of information, we could reintroduce the climate of openness to which I refer.  I accept that pesky journalists might ask detailed questions about particular elements of Government.  Is that a major price to pay for restoring a climate of confidence and openness and a sense that the country is going places?  When the Government gave in to senior civil servants, it allowed them to regain control of the files and restore the type of secrecy many of them have been trained to love.</p>

            <p eId="para_251">The extension of the Freedom of Information Act is an ongoing process involving the Department of Finance.  Last year and the year before — in the largest ever extension of the Act — its provisions were extended to 137 further bodies.  As a result, more than 520 bodies are now covered by the Act.  This compares with a figure of 67 when it came into operation a decade ago.  In such circumstances, I am afraid the Deputy's argument falls.</p>
            <p eId="para_252">Deputy Burton is probably not aware that the only significant change made to the Act in 2003 relates to the protection of what are considered exempt records, namely, those relating to meetings of Government in respect of which the deliberative process has not been completed.  This extends to the records of certain committees where the committee concerned is certified by the Secretary General as being established in direct support of such deliberations.  The Deputy made the point that this amounts to a regaining of control on the part of certain individuals.  Since the introduction of the change in 2003, the number of issues that have been signed off on and certified is none.</p>

We cannot obtain an indication from the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children regarding when this little boy can access the education and services to which he is entitled.  The Taoiseach can come before the House and impugn the reputation of the board of management of Castleknock Educate Together national school but there is no recourse, via the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, to discover what has occurred within the confines of Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_378">The Taoiseach has just shared much information.  When the Taoiseach answered this question previously, he was more detailed in his reply as he listed a range of committees.  Does the subgroup of senior officials on disability, which was to progress work on the Disability Bill, still exists?  What progress has been made in that group's deliberations?</p>
            <p eId="para_379">To keep this brief, as the Taoiseach is inclined to do in this instance, I ask the same question with regard to the strategic task force on alcohol, which was to review international research to identify and recommend to Government specific evidence-based measures to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm.  Where does that task force stand and is that project being progressed at this time?</p>

            <p eId="para_388">Given that my Department is at the centre of Government, it is involved in a large range of cross-departmental teams.  The team dealing with the alcohol issue is one of them.  I am not sure if it is relevant to this question but two pieces of legislation are related.  I answered about one of them during legislative questions and the appropriate Minister has not made a final decision on the other.</p>

            <p eId="para_389">I accept what the Taoiseach has stated but there is a need for a greater information flow in this House on the work of cross-departmental and interdepartmental teams and task forces.  I am specifically trying to secure some up-to-date information about just two of them.  With reference to the helpful mode the Taoiseach is suggesting he is in this morning, perhaps he will undertake to circulate to this Deputy the up-to-date position on the two areas I have addressed if his notes do not offer the salient detail.  These are the subgroup of senior officials on disability, a very important area, and the strategic task force on alcohol.</p>
            <p eId="para_390">The Taoiseach has shared information with us, particularly with regard to the latter, given the significant public concern about the abuse of alcohol, particularly by younger people.  There are many areas of concern, both in regard to the health of young people and how alcohol affects development and contributes to the continual carnage on our roads.  There is a raft of areas involved so I would like to know where this so-called strategic task force stands.  Where is its work programme at this point and when will it report?</p>
            <p eId="para_391">It would be welcome if the Taoiseach could elaborate on what he has said.  I will understand if he does not but in the same spirit as he responded on the question before, I ask him to circulate further information subsequently.</p>

            <p eId="para_393">I would not be involved with these groups on a daily basis but I know the position of the group relating to alcohol.  Two separate pieces of legislation are being considered.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has commenced the examination of the sale of alcohol products and he has engaged the same chairman who dealt with the previous legislation to consider what can be done about the sale and supply of alcohol.  The Deputy made the point about the significant number of outlets where alcohol is available, from petrol stations to supermarkets.  The issue will be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_394">The other matter relates to advertising.  The attitude taken to that for the past few years is to try to co-ordinate the industry to work together to change the image regarding the abuse of alcohol.  If that is not working, it is open to the Minister and the cross-departmental team to make a decision at any time to proceed with advertising legislation, which was substantially drafted a few years ago.  They are the two main issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_395">The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, hopes to have a Bill on the sale of alcohol in the House later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_398">The Deputy will be aware I have outlined to the House now on a number of occasions that Cabinet committees are an integral part of the Cabinet process.  Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet or Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government.  The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.  As always, questions on particular policy issues should be put down to the relevant Ministers.</p>

            <p eId="para_401">I accept the points made by the Taoiseach about Cabinet confidentiality.  Does the Taoiseach accept that three meetings since the last general election of a committee charged with dealing with the vital issue of climate change is hardly an impressive record?  I suggest the sub-committee has been remarkably ineffective.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware regarding the Government's climate change strategy that fewer than half the targets of 2007 were met.  The overshoot of the Kyoto target is now almost 100%.</p>
            <p eId="para_402">Is the Taoiseach not ashamed that despite the rhetoric, nothing has worked to ensure there is a real change as a result of a pressing challenge facing the world?  Does the Taoiseach accept responsibility because, unlike other key heads of Government, he has been remarkably silent on the issue of climate change, which has added to lethargy in tackling an enormously important political issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_403">The committee was set up at the very end of September.  That is four months ago and there have been three meetings, so I would consider it an active committee.  The officials group meets separately.</p>
            <p eId="para_404">I explained recently in the House in answer to another question that all the issues regarding climate change and negotiations with the European Commission on the decisions made in January were all directed at the Cabinet table.  They were not directed to the sub-committee.  The discussions which went on for most of last year related to the Commission's decisions and the share of the burden we all have to take.  All of the meetings were discussed by Cabinet.</p>
            <p eId="para_405">The issues of climate change and renewable energy are rarely off the main Cabinet table.  As per the terms of reference, certain aspects are put to the sub-committee but the day to day important issues and what we are doing with the Commission are taken at full Cabinet level.</p>

They need to be led from the top.  Does the Taoiseach not accept that his lack of leadership on climate change is part of the problem?  When will he give that direction to ensure that we make real changes to tackle climate change which affects every one of us but, most important, parts of the globe that are too poor to help themselves?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_416">I do not accept any of that.  It is nonsense.  This issue has been on the agenda for most meetings of the Cabinet over the past two years.  The sub-committee was set up to deal with aspects of it and the officials group is working hard on it.  The Deputy should put down a question to the relevant Minister whom I am sure would be glad to give the detail.  I have been involved through social partnership with what we have done on the question of renewable energy and burden sharing with the Enterprise Ireland strategy, industry and agriculture.  If the Deputy watched what we were doing she would see the comments about that.  Probably seven or eight Ministers are actively involved in this, not just one Minister or me.  We have just completed a long, difficult and arduous negotiation with the Commission in which I was directly involved and which has been well publicised.  We completed this in the past few weeks and received backing from President Barroso who was kind enough to thank the country and me personally for our involvement in it.  Several Ministers are involved in this problem.  I accept that the Deputy wishes to follow up on this but she should table a question to the Minister because he would be glad to give some of the background on this issue.</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_88">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_432">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 21, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_433">I visited South Africa between 13 and 15 January, accompanied by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Micheál Martin, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for overseas development, Deputy Michael Kitt.</p>
            <p eId="para_434">The key objectives of the visit were to further develop Irish-South African bilateral and trade relations, leading the largest ever Irish trade mission to South Africa with more than 50 companies participating including businesses from Northern Ireland, and also to visit Irish Aid funded development projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_435">In Cape Town, I visited the Niall Mellon Township Trust, where I announced that the Irish Government is providing €5 million to support the work of the trust in Cape Town and Johannesburg.  I also attended a reception for the Irish community in South Africa hosted by the Irish ambassador to South Africa as well as visiting a number of businesses and charitable organisations with Irish links.</p>
            <p eId="para_436">In Johannesburg, I attended a breakfast organised by Tourism Ireland with the aim of promoting the image of the island of Ireland as a destination to South African tourists and business travellers.  I also visited a seminar organised by An Bord Bia in the wake of the recent reopening of the South African market to Irish beef and attended a business lunch organised by Enterprise Ireland to promote and further develop Irish-South African trade links.</p>
            <p eId="para_437">In Pretoria, I met with both President Mbeki and with the Deputy President.  President Mbeki and I noted the positive bilateral relations between our two countries and discussed a range of political and trade and development issues.  President Mbeki briefed me on the current political situation in Zimbabwe, the prospects for successful elections there and his role as mediator.  We both expressed the wish for a peaceful solution to the crises facing Zimbabwe and for policy change which would ensure full respect for the human rights and dignity of its people.</p>
            <p eId="para_438">I referred to the impending deployment of some 400 members of the Irish Defence Forces with the UN mandated EU military mission in Chad, and the fact that an Irishman, Lieutenant General Pat Nash, is the operational commander of that mission.  I also took the opportunity to express Ireland's great admiration for South Africa's impressive achievements as a young democracy along with my personal appreciation to President Mbeki and the people of South Africa for their sensitive support for the peace process in Northern Ireland, which many of their people gave over recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_439">My subsequent meeting with the Deputy President expanded on many of the issues we discussed during her visit to Dublin in November 2006.  Once again, we had a cordial and constructive discussion on a number of issues.  We discussed recent progress in South Africa's economic development including in the area of education and training.  I assured the Deputy President of Ireland's support for furthering skills training for young South Africans and we agreed to mutually explore ways to assist South Africa in learning from Ireland's experience in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_440">I also reaffirmed the Government's commitment to continuing to provide development assistance through our Irish Aid programmes including assistance for the major challenges posed by the effects of the HIV-AIDS pandemic.  Finally, I welcomed the decision of the South African Government to reopen the market for Irish beef.  I thanked the Deputy President for the political support provided on this issue and said I hoped my visit would help to further strengthen the already strong political, trade and development links between Ireland and South Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_441">On the conclusion of my visit to South Africa, I travelled to Tanzania, accompanied by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for overseas development, Deputy Michael Kitt, to see at first hand the impact of Irish Aid's development programme in that country.  I visited several projects supported by Irish Aid in key areas such as health, education and agriculture.  I had a wide range of contacts with people whose lives have been transformed as a result of Irish Aid support; with NGOs and others, including Irish missionaries working on the front line; with senior members of the media; and with the political leadership in Tanzania.</p>
            <p eId="para_442">It was a most useful and thorough programme.  I was extremely heartened to see the profound effect that targeted assistance can have on the everyday lives of some of the poorest people on the planet.  For example, I witnessed the immediate impact on the health and well-being of people as a result of providing a clean fresh water supply and in the provision of badly needed health services.  It was also a pleasure to meet the many Irish people delivering essential front line assistance and I would like to pay tribute to their commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_443">During my visit, I met with President Kikwete.  We had a wide-ranging discussion on our respective economies in the course of which I repeated Ireland's ongoing commitment to development in Tanzania, which will involve some €170 million in direct bilateral assistance between 2007 and 2010.  This year alone, the direct aid figure will be approximately €40 million.  In particular, we discussed the importance of good governance for the provision of effective aid, greater trade and investment and enhanced international relations.  I commended the president on the strong position he has taken on the need to tackle corruption, the action he has recently taken in this regard and the need to continue with his efforts.</p>
            <p eId="para_444">We also discussed some of the challenges that exist in other parts of Africa including Zimbabwe, where the situation remains a cause for grave concern, and the more recent developments in Kenya which could have severe implications for Tanzania.  I welcomed the mediation role being played by Tanzania and noted that Ireland and Tanzania share a proud tradition of peacekeeping activities.  In this regard, I briefed the president on the role that Ireland will now be playing in Chad.</p>
            <p eId="para_445">In conclusion, I confirmed that Tanzania is a particularly important partner in Ireland's development programme and we will continue to provide assistance in close collaboration with the Tanzanian Government to help realise the full potential of all its people.</p>
            <p eId="para_446">Working through government systems is an effective approach which allows us to provide sustainable support for key sectors in partnership, and in line with the priorities of, the Tanzanian Government.  Needless to say, we will also ensure that we continue to support our NGO partners in their valuable work, both in Tanzania and elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_447">With regard to my travel plans for 2008, I will of course attend all the European Councils during the year.  I propose to travel to Slovenia, Austria and Poland next week for a series of bilateral meetings and for an engagement with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  I will make my usual annual visit to the United States for St. Patrick's Day on 17 March.  I have also been invited to address the Joint Houses of Congress in the US on 30 April.  In addition, I propose to attend the Fifth Summit of the Heads of State and Government of Latin America and the Caribbean and the European Union in Lima, Peru on 16 May 2008.  I also propose to attend the EU-Asia Summit which will be held in Beijing, China in October 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_448">The National Forum on Europe is an independent body and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on its day-to-day operation or on its likely future work programme.  I am, however, sure it will play a key role in the debate on the reform treaty in the run up to the referendum.  I welcome its recent publication and the fact that it is holding public meetings around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_449">I received the first draft of the annotated draft agenda for the spring European Council recently.  The launch of the new cycle for the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs, the stability of financial markets and energy and climate change policy will feature in the discussion at the spring European Council.  The draft agenda was the subject of a first discussion at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday.</p>
            <p eId="para_450">I have no firm arrangements to meet with President Barroso ahead of seeing him at the European Council in Brussels on 13 and 14 March.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_451">It is appropriate that I should congratulate the Taoiseach and wish him the best on being invited to address the joint Houses of Congress in the United States.  After a lengthy period as Taoiseach he has achieved a first for a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach and is following in the footsteps of the two Cosgraves, father and son, as well as Garret FitzGerald and John Bruton.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_91">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_453">Mr. de Valera addressed the Houses of Congress in his capacity as President.  It will be an interesting April for the Taoiseach.  As he is aware, he will begin his address to one congress on 1 April and to another Congress on 30 April.  At some point during the Taoiseach's contribution to the joint Houses of Congress, he should be in a position to refer to progress being made on the undocumented Irish problem, that is, the immigration problem to the United States, arising from the bilateral all-party agreement in this House.  Hopefully this could become a reality and I wish the Taoiseach well in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_454">I refer to the increasing complexities and logistical nightmare associated with the Chad mission and the obvious tinderbox that is Kosovo.  Would it be appropriate, even for an interim period, for the Taoiseach to call together a group comprising himself and representatives from the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Foreign Affairs and Defence to monitor the situation in respect of the ongoing safety of Irish troops and Defence Forces personnel in both Chad and Kosovo?  The Garda is also involved in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_455">Has the Taoiseach decided yet on a date for the EU reform treaty referendum?  As the Taoiseach is aware, a significant change will take place with regard to qualified majority voting as new competencies will be decided by that method.  I am concerned that the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny may not be adequately resourced.  A river of information is coming towards Members, who are ill-prepared for the avalanche of material coming from that source.  In respect of the reform treaty, the Government should see to it that the requisite personnel and staff are in place to deal with that flood of information.  One does not wish to see a situation arise whereby questions may be asked that cannot be answered.  A great deal of this information can be quite complex for the average Member serving on the joint committee.  In the national interest, the Government should ensure that this joint committee is serviced properly in order that Members in attendance are adequately informed on the issues that arise from the Commission, the Parliament and the Council.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_92">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_456">I refer to the grouping together of questions Nos. 7 to 21.  There is no relationship between the work of the National Forum on Europe and its scheduled meetings on the Lisbon treaty, the EU reform treaty or whatever name one wishes to call it, and the Taoiseach's meeting with President Mbeki in South Africa.  I do not understand this grouping, which is an absolute mishmash of questions and is completely inappropriate.  In the brief opportunity provided, Members cannot address any of these matters in the serious detail they deserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_457">I will conclude with a single question.  Unfortunately, I will be obliged to leave to one side the scheduling of the National Forum on Europe.  When the Taoiseach met President Mbeki in South Africa, was the issue of Zimbabwe discussed in detail?  Did the Taoiseach emphasise the importance of addressing the outrageous situation that applies in that country?  Did the Taoiseach convey to President Mbeki the views of the Irish people, which I understand are shared across this House?  Did they discuss what actions, if any, the Taoiseach believed the South African or Irish Governments could take or what impression both men intended to make on the international community to address the situation in Zimbabwe?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_93">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_458">Like Deputy Kenny, I wish the Taoiseach well in his forthcoming address to the joint Houses of Congress.  Does he intend to raise the issue of the undocumented Irish during his two planned visits to the United States?</p>
            <p eId="para_459">As for the EU meeting, I refer to developments in Kosovo last weekend.  Will Ireland formally recognise Kosovo?  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has not made clear the exact Irish position.  Has the Government considered the implications for the mandate for Ireland's participation in the international security presence in Kosovo, KFOR, which is authorised under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of 1999?  In the absence of UN recognition for an independent Kosovo, will it be possible for Ireland to maintain a contribution to the international military presence in Kosovo, under NATO or other auspices, without a UN mandate?  What timeframe has been outlined to sort out the mandate of the Irish troops?  This matter is important in respect of both the troops' ability to operate if their mandate has been compromised by the changes that took place last weekend and Ireland's consequent positions on those changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_460">Does the Government propose to have monitors participate in the forthcoming elections in Zimbabwe?  The Government's position in this regard is unclear to me.  Moreover, in respect of the trouble in Kenya, it is now agreed that more than 1,000 people are dead.  A massive amount of intercommunal violence has taken place, much of which has been targeted against women and children as has happened in Darfur, including rape and sexual violence against women.</p>
            <p eId="para_461">Thankfully, Ireland now is among the major contributors to international aid.  While I commend the Taoiseach on his visit to southern Africa and to Tanzania, is Ireland pulling its weight with regard to the level of contribution it makes in respect of aid at present?  The issue of land reform is central to the dispute in Kenya.  Moreover, it is central to the historic legacy of that which has now pauperised Zimbabwe.  In that unfortunate country, people no longer have enough to feed their families.  Can the Taoiseach be more precise as to what he envisages Ireland doing to assist actively in decelerating such conflicts and to solving thorny issues in Africa such as land reform?  Is the Government supporting initiatives that would lead to long-term real settlements?  Members have only heard general stuff from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_94">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_462">I will make a number of points.  Obviously, the Government will continue to try to develop a consensus on the undocumented Irish as it has done for the past few years.  While I stated previously that it might be difficult to make much progress this year, we must continue to make our case.  I will discuss it again with President Bush in a few weeks' time.</p>
            <p eId="para_463">On the new reform treaty, I have indicated that I would like to deal with it before the end of May or early in June.  Parties are working with the Attorney General's office and it would be important to finalise that in the next few days because then it could be brought before the Government next week.  That would trigger the legislation for Members to debate in the House.  I also am anxious to give three months to the referendum commission so perhaps we can try to get that in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_464">On the committees, I agree with Deputy Kenny's point regarding the volume.  When the committees were being set up, some people — not Deputy Kenny — stated that we appeared to be establishing too many of them.  At the time, however, I made the point that this was due simply to the volume of work before the Houses.  Parliamentarians understand this but perhaps those outside the Houses do not.  A huge volume of work exists and I split up the two committees to allow them to deal with the volume of work.  This is a matter for the commission.  The committees in question are going to become increasingly busy for evermore.  The issue of such business will be never-ending.</p>
            <p eId="para_465">I refer to questions from Deputies Ó Caoláin, Kenny and Burton on Zimbabwe.  This probably formed the longest part of my discussion because I was anxious to hear from President Mbeki, who was acting as the negotiator with Zimbabwe on behalf of the overall umbrella group in southern Africa.  He gave me a long report and was to go to Zimbabwe the following day to try to make progress and work towards elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_466">Time will not allow me to elaborate on every development; suffice it to say that, in the past year or two, the relevant parties have drafted a substantial amount of legislation and the new constitution.  There is substantive agreement on some issues, but, as always in such circumstances, it has not been possible to resolve a few deal-crunching issues in respect of the election.  One of the key issues is the question of when the president goes as part of the new election.  That has been the key deal breaker since January and it has not been resolved since.  President Mbeki and others have been involved in the process.  President Levy Mwanawasa, whom I met in Tanzania, has taken over as the chairman of the South African Development Community.</p>
            <p eId="para_467">On the general point, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his predecessor have been actively engaged and very supportive of the reforms for a number of reasons.  Ireland is highly respected in the region because it is contributing a lot of aid.  Ireland is the sixth best donor in the world and a large part of our funds is channelled into the region.  We have many key people on the ground and many of the traditional missionaries are still present.  They are well known and have educated many of the leaders.  Ireland has many substantial people in the UN organisations and NGOs and they are now very well known.  We are engaging very substantively in the region.  Our presence may not be large in number in comparison to other countries, but the people in question are certainly very significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_468">On 17 February, the Kosovo Assembly adopted the resolution declaring Kosovo's independence.  At the General Affairs Council on Monday, the Foreign Ministers noted the resolution and reiterated the European Union's commitment to the principles of the UN charter and the Helsinki Final Act, underlining that in light of the conflict of the 1990s and the extended period of international administration under Security Council Resolution 1244, Kosovo constitutes a <i>sui generis</i> case.  The Council also noted that member states will decide in accordance with international practice and international law on the relations with Kosovo.</p>
            <p eId="para_469">It is regrettable that lengthy negotiations have failed to produce an agreement with Belgrade and Pristina.  A new UN Security Council resolution clarifying the position would have been greatly preferable to the current circumstances.  A considerable effort was made by us and others to achieve such a resolution but the clear reality is that Serbia effectively lost Kosovo through its own actions in the 1990s.  The legacy of the killing of thousands of civilians in Kosovo and the ethnic cleansing of over 1 million made the restoration of a Serbian dominion in Kosovo unthinkable.</p>
            <p eId="para_470">The European Council agreed just before Christmas that the <i>status quo</i> in Kosovo was inherently unstable and that more than 90% of the population wanted independence.  This is supported by our major partners in the European Union and beyond, many of whom have already recognised Kosovo.  Taking all the circumstances into account, the Minister for Foreign Affairs intends to recommend that we recognise the Republic of Kosovo at next week’s meeting of the Cabinet.  To answer the Deputy’s question, we will make a decision on this next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_471">On the basis of positive advice from the Attorney General confirming the continuation of UN Security Council Resolution 1244 in the aftermath of a declaration of independence, we are committed to maintaining our enhanced presence in KFOR, the UN-mandated international presence in Kosovo.  We intend to contribute members of the Garda in the SDP mission and also to support the economic development of Kosovo.</p>
            <p eId="para_472">The Minister for Defence spoke about Chad for an hour yesterday and there is not much point in repeating what he said.  There is continuing international support for the deployment of EUFOR.  The European Union has reaffirmed its commitment to the mission and the United Nations has condemned the rebels' actions.  The deployment of 50 members of the Army rangers is expected to take place today.  It is urgent that security and protection be provided for refugees.  It is a considerable humanitarian issue and this was emphasised to me when I was in Africa.  It has been emphasised to me by several countries since then.  I am mindful of the need to minimise risk.  We remain strongly committed to the humanitarian objectives of the EUFOR mission.</p>

Looking back to the Government's legislation list published in May 2003, this Bill was then called judicial conduct and ethics Bill and was promised for 2004, but it has been pushed back further and further since then.  The current legislation list states it is not possible to indicate when publication of the Bill is expected.  Why is publication of the Bill being pushed back?</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Does the Government not agree that the matter of judicial conduct and the regulation of judicial conduct and of judges is important?  We had the case of Circuit Court Judge Brian Curtin, which involved the Oireachtas engaging in a complicated process leading to his potential impeachment.  If a similar problem arose with another judge, we would be faced with the same procedure as the only way available to deal with it.  We also hear eccentric and irrational comments and outbursts from a few members of the Judiciary from time to time.  This Bill was meant to provide a forum in which judges' behaviour could be addressed, if necessary.  What has happened to this Bill?  It seems to have simply got lost.</p>

That is a message for Deputies that rather than the Bill nearing publication it is heading for relegation, off the radar entirely.

The county managers of Dublin City Council and Fingal Council have asked that the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government end that as soon as possible.  Is legislation to be brought forward in this regard or will the Minister keep dodging this issue?  He has been dodging it for the past eight or nine months as regards young householders who have major mortgages to repay and who find their houses cracking and breaking up around them, and companies are not taking responsibility for this.

        <speech by="#JohnGormley" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_169">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_554">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_555">The purpose of the Bill is twofold: to provide a permanent legislative basis for the motor tax increases that were approved by Dáil Éireann by way of financial resolution on budget day, 5 December 2007; and to give statutory effect to the new carbon dioxide, CO2, based motor tax system for new and pre-owned imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008, which I announced in my carbon budget on 6 December 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The Bill contains seven sections and one Schedule.  Taking the motor tax increases first, the Bill is the necessary follow-up to the financial resolution passed by this House on 5 December 2007.  The resolution has only limited statutory effect and is required to be replaced by a Bill to provide a permanent legal basis for the motor tax increases.  The increases took effect from 1 February 2008.  The increases are 9.5% for cars below 2.5 litres and 11% for cars above that threshold. Motor tax on goods and all other vehicles also increase by 9.5%, with no increase for electric vehicles.  Duties for trade plate licences also increased by 9.5%.  These are the registration plates used by motor traders on vehicles which are temporarily in their possession.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The increases in motor tax rates must be considered against the background of an increase of over 15% in inflation since the last increase in motor tax rates in 2004.  For the lowest engine size car of up to 1000cc, the annual rate increase is €14, or 27 cent a week.  For cars in the 1001cc to 1400cc range, the annual increase is between €22 and €28, or 42 cent and 54 cent a week.  For cars in the 1401cc to 1700cc range, the annual increase is between €30 and €39, representing a weekly increase of between 58 cent and 75 cent.  In summary, 95% of the car fleet, which is those with engine size of less than 2 litres, will see extra costs of between 27 cent and 98 cent a week.  In the case of goods vehicles, 87% of such vehicles will see an annual increase of €24, or 46 cent per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">As I stated previously in the House, the purpose of the changes in motor tax rates is to increase funding for local government.  It is important to emphasise that the proceeds of motor tax are not paid into the Exchequer, rather they are paid directly into the local government fund.  This fund, which replaced the equalisation fund established in 1997 to divert motor tax revenue directly to local government, is ring-fenced exclusively for local government purposes.  It cannot be used for any other purpose.  The motor tax element of the fund is supplemented on an annual basis by an Exchequer contribution paid into the fund.  The fund is used primarily to finance regional and local roads and the general purpose needs of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Deputies will be aware of the significant role which the local government fund has played in the financing of local government since it was established in 1999.  Total funding for 2008 amounts to some €1.6 billion, which represents approximately 30% of local authority current funding requirements.  The fund comprises two elements — an Exchequer contribution of €545 million and the proceeds of motor tax, which are projected to reach €1,080 million for 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">The ability of local government to respond to the ever-increasing demands for improved services in recent years clearly demonstrates the success of the local government fund.  These demands have arisen as a result of an expanding population, unprecedented economic growth and higher customer expectations.  Not only has the fund been successful in delivering resources locally, it has succeeded in limiting the direct financial contribution required of local communities and businesses through rates and charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The local government fund plays a key role in funding regional and local roads.  These roads, which represent some 94% of the country's road network, serve an important economic role and they also have valuable social and community functions.  While we have experienced increased urbanisation and a move away from agriculture in recent times, the network of regional and local roads is still vital in providing mobility within and between local economies and in providing links to the strategic national road network and the ports and airports which are our links with the wider European and world economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The impact of the regional and local road network on regional development takes on an added importance as we move forward with implementation of the national spatial strategy.  Investment in strategic non-national roads is critical to developing our gateways, hubs and other growth centres.  Investment within and between these centres and their hinterlands plays a key role in improving connectivity, circulation and facilitating the development of strategically-placed land banks.  The programme to develop and maintain the non-national road network is not confined to urban centres.  It is vital for rural communities that improvements in transport infrastructure continue to be implemented.  The programme also has an important road safety dimension in the context of increased safety measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The National Development Plan 2007-2013, provides that some €4.3 billion will be invested by the local government fund and the Exchequer in the regional and local road network over the period of the plan.  While responsibility for regional and local roads was transferred to the Department of Transport with effect from 1 January 2008, the fund will continue to provide significant resources towards the development and maintenance of the network.  This year alone, €565 million will be provided from the local government fund for these roads.  Together with an Exchequer provision, the total funding for regional and local roads in 2008 is €618 million.  Details of grants to local authorities for this purpose were announced last Friday by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">With regard to 2008, I have allocated from the fund record levels of some €999.2 million in general purpose grants to local authorities.  These grants are my Department's contribution to local authorities towards the gap between the cost of providing an acceptable level of day-to-day services and the income they obtain from other sources.  The amount provided this year represents an increase of some €52 million over the record levels provided in 2007.  It is a clear signal of the Government's commitment to the local government sector and a recognition of the importance it attaches to local democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">It is critically important that the improvements which have been brought about in the financing of local authorities in the past decade are built upon.  In this context, the local government fund has played a key role.  It must have the resources necessary to ensure that increases in funding to local authorities for regional and local roads and general purpose grants are adequate to meet demands.  I want to ensure that local government continues to deliver for communities and business across its wide range of services.  The additional income which will accrue from the changes in motor tax rates will assist in delivering on that objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">There has not been an increase in motor tax rates since 2004. In that time, inflation increased by over 15%.  The 9.5% increase for the majority of vehicles is well below inflation in the intervening period.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">It is clear that the motor tax increases are primarily designed to increase revenue for the local government fund, and in turn, for local authorities.  However, along with the changes in motor tax rates for the existing fleet, and as announced in my carbon budget on 6 December 2007, the Bill also provides for a fundamental change in the manner in which motor tax will be charged for new cars and new imports in the future.  This measure gives effect to the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce measures to rebalance motor tax in favour of cars with lower CO2 emissions. It complements the new CO2 -based VRT system which is provided for in the Finance Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The new CO2-based motor tax system will apply to new and pre-owned imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008.  This measure is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to tackle climate change.  Climate change is profound in its implications for the planet and its inhabitants and represents a very significant challenge to society.  It cuts to the core of modern living and commercial activity.  The solution is clear.  We must reduce human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases and we must do so quickly if we are to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.  We all have a responsibility to play our part.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">While in global terms, Ireland's emissions may be relatively small, it is essential that we apply the resourcefulness and initiative that has delivered very significant economic success for this country over the past decade to the challenge of adapting to a low-carbon society.  Along with our EU colleagues, we have been to the forefront in bringing the Kyoto Protocol into force.  Our efforts to secure global agreement on deep cuts in emissions must be backed up by a commensurate level of ambition at home.  The programme for Government and the carbon budget which I delivered last December make it clear that we are up for that challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Following a review in 2007 of its strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from new cars, the European Commission concluded that only limited progress had been made towards the central goal of limiting average vehicle emissions of new cars sold in the EU to 120g/km by 2012.  In light of this review, the Commission announced the framework of a new strategy that sets out an integrated approach towards achieving this overall objective.  The new approach proposed a combination of legislative measures; encouraging member states which levy car taxes to base them on CO2 emissions; promoting improvements in vehicle technology through enhanced research efforts; and promoting the purchase of fuel-efficient vehicles.  Road transport generates about one fifth of the European Union's CO2 emissions, with passenger cars responsible for approximately 12%.  Although recent years have seen improvements in vehicle technology, particularly in fuel efficiency, which translates into lower CO2 emissions, this has not been enough to stem the growth in emissions due mainly to increased car ownership and increased size.  While the EU reduced overall emissions of greenhouse gases by almost 5% between 1990 and 2004, CO2 emissions from road transport rose by 26%.  This was despite a reduction of more than 12% in average new car CO2 emissions between 1995 and 2004.  The situation in Ireland is even starker.  While road transport accounts for a similar portion of total emissions, we have seen an increase in emissions from road transport by more than 180% between 1990 and 2006.  This reflects growth from relatively low car ownership levels in 1990, a trend that seems set to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">It is in this context that I am moving from a motor tax regime where the charge is based on engine size to one based on CO2 emissions.  As I said, the new CO2-based motor tax system will apply to new and pre-owned imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008 and will complement the new CO2-based VRT system which is provided for in the Finance Bill.  Both new tax systems have been informed by an extensive public consultation process.  The initial consultation document on motor tax proposed a system based on a combination of CO2 emissions and engine size.  My clear view is that if we are serious about addressing emissions from cars, we need to move to a system based solely on CO2 emission levels.  I am pleased to say that this view was shared by a large number of respondents to the public consultation exercise and that this approach is reflected in the Finance Bill in terms of the rebalancing of VRT.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Turning to the detail of the new motor tax system, there will be seven CO2 bands, commonly referred to as the seven white labels, A to G.  The same bands will apply in respect of VRT so that there will be commonality of approach as between the motor tax and VRT systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">The motor tax rates, which will apply to new and pre-owned imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008, are set out in paragraph 6(<i>d</i>) of the Schedule to the Bill, which will replace Part 1 of the Schedule to the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952.  Rates will be graduated as cars move up through the CO2 bands, as follows.  For band A, which corresponds to CO2 emissions not exceeding 120 g per km, the motor tax rate will be €100.  The rate for band B, which corresponds to CO2 emissions of greater than 120 but not exceeding 140 g per km, will be €150.  The rate for band C will be €290, which corresponds to CO2 emissions of greater than 140 but not more than 155 g per km.  Band D, which corresponds to CO2 emissions of greater than 155 but not exceeding 170 g per km, will attract a rate of €430.  The rate for band E will be €600, which corresponds to CO2 emissions of greater than 170 and not more than 190 g per km.  Band F, which corresponds to CO2 emissions of greater than 190 and not more than 225 g per km, will attract a rate of €1,000.  For the top band, band G, the rate will be €2,000, which reflects CO2 emissions of more than 225 g per km.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The top rate of €2,000 will also apply to a car where the CO2 emissions level cannot be confirmed by the Revenue Commissioners by reference to the relevant EC type approval certificate or EC certificate of conformity and the Revenue Commissioners are not otherwise satisfied by reference to any other document produced in support of the declaration for registration pursuant to section 131 of the Finance Act 1992.  This parallels the approach to apply in the case of determination of the VRT rate for a car.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Cars registered before 1 July 2008 will continue to be taxed in future years under the existing motor tax system related to engine size.  There has been some criticism that the new CO2-based system is not being applied retrospectively to the existing fleet.  I have examined the issue and concluded that it would not be appropriate to do so.  From the outset, the public consultation process on motor tax made it clear that the new CO2-based system would apply from a specified date and that cars registered before that date would continue to be taxed in future years under the existing motor tax system related to engine size.  Retrospection would not be practicable as there is no authenticated CO2 data for the majority of the existing fleet.  The CO2 values on the Revenue and NVDF systems, in respect of new cars only, have not heretofore been used for any business purpose, have not been collected as the basis for a fiscal charge and, accordingly, have not been authenticated to any degree.  It would be unsound to apply charges on the basis of such data.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The application of CO2 ratings to VRT and motor tax from 1 July 2008 will place a very definite emphasis on the accuracy of the detail on the Revenue system, and consequently on the NVDF, post July 2008.  If the new system were to be applied retrospectively, it would be unfair to penalise people for a purchasing decision made in the past.  Nobody will pay more motor tax than they are paying at present.  If there was an optional "opt in" to the new system, it would undermine the revenue base of local government, resulting in serious financial problems for local authorities throughout the country.  While there will never be a solution that will satisfy everybody, the Government proposals are fair, equitable and practical.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The clear objective of this new motor tax system is to influence the purchasing decisions of consumers.  Purchasers of cars with low CO2 emissions will be rewarded while a premium will be charged on vehicles with high CO2 emissions.  From 1 July 2008, anyone buying a new car or importing a pre-owned car can make a choice for the environment by purchasing a low CO2 emitting car and thus enjoy a lower rate of motor tax.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_579">Alternatively, if the choice is to purchase a high CO2 emissions car, a higher rate of motor tax will apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">For most of us a car is likely to be the most expensive thing we will ever buy, with the exception of a home.  Every year, more than 150,000 Irish people decide to buy a brand new car.  The prices paid by consumers range from €11,000 for the most inexpensive models to, in rare cases, large six figure sums.  It is not a decision many people make lightly and most people choose very carefully when buying.  Considerations such as affordability, functionality, economy, safety, performance and colour have traditionally come into play for people when deciding on what car best suits their need.  From 1 July, however, when people decide on what car to buy, they will add a new factor.  They will need to "think carbon".  With our new taxation system for cars, this decision to think carbon can save them thousands of euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">A key part of the motor tax and VRT initiatives will be a new mandatory labelling system for cars based on CO2 emission levels.  Requirements relating to the display of information on a car's fuel economy and CO2 emissions were introduced in 2001 on foot of an EU directive.  All new passenger cars offered for sale or lease in Ireland must therefore already be accompanied by a fuel economy label that displays information on the vehicle's fuel consumption and its carbon dioxide emissions.  The regulations also require the publication of a guide for consumers on the fuel economy and CO2 emissions of all makes and models of new passenger cars for sale in Ireland and that similar information be included in promotional material and advertising.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Experience has shown that the existing labelling requirements are not sufficiently consumer-friendly and that an improved design would be beneficial to car buyers.  It would help in assessing the environmental impacts of various cars and would provide guidance on the purchase and running costs.  I am proposing therefore that the requirements on the display of a new label be changed with effect from 1 July 2008 to coincide with the introduction of the new CO2-based motor tax and VRT systems.  It is my intention that this new label will include consumer-friendly information on a vehicle's CO2 emissions, based on the seven CO2 bands.  The label will be similar to the energy rating label which already exists for many consumer electrical goods and which is already familiar to consumers.  The label should also include information on fuel efficiency, the amount of motor tax and the applicable rate of vehicle registration tax.  I will bring forward separate legislation to give effect to these proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The new labelling regime will be accompanied by an active public information campaign which will promote the purchase of fuel efficient cars.  My aim is to ensure consumers are fully aware of the incentives being created through changes to the motor taxation system.  This will assist them in making informed decisions.  These incentives are designed to arrest the trend, evident over many years, of increasing emissions from the road transport sector.  This will go some way towards Ireland's compliance with its Kyoto Protocol obligations, but will also put the country on a better footing for the more demanding targets facing us in the period up to 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Deputies will be aware of the importance of motor tax to the funding of local authorities.  As I said at the outset, motor tax receipts are paid directly into the local government fund which is ring-fenced exclusively for local government purposes.  These receipts are supplemented on an annual basis by an Exchequer contribution.  Total funding for 2007 amounts to €1.6 billion, which represents approximately 30% of local authority current funding requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The fundamental changes which are contained in this Bill in terms of moving to a CO2 based motor tax regime are designed to achieve financial neutrality in the context of income to the fund.  We are clearly breaking new ground with the overriding objective of progressively reducing CO2 emissions from cars.  As we move forward, there will be a need to keep the new arrangements under review to ensure the environmental objective is delivered while, at the same time, protecting this important source of funding for local authorities.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_586">The issue of climate change and Ireland's contribution to the warming of our planet remains squarely on the political agenda and Fine Gael continues to consider it a policy priority.  Ireland has played its part in the emission of greenhouse gases over the years in a negative way and we continue to be one of the worst offenders for the amount CO2 put into the atmosphere.  Total greenhouse gas emissions in 2006 were 69.77 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.  For a population of our size on a land-mass of Ireland's size we have become one of the larger polluters compared to other countries.  Years of Government inaction and short-sightedness have brought us to this situation.  For example, we have built 500,000 houses in the past ten or 12 years without any reference to appropriate insulation or building standards to help reduce carbon emissions in that sector.  Thus we are left playing catch-up to meet some of the necessary objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Government failure to tackle greenhouse gas emissions has led the European Union to impose an ambitious and drastic target of reducing emissions by 20% of our 2005 level by 2020.  Only two other countries, Luxembourg and Denmark, were also given the highest possible target.  This is the challenging situation in which we now find ourselves but it is a damning indictment of how the international community judges Ireland's attempts to curtail CO2 emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The Government is entirely responsible for the transport sector, which is reporting rapidly rising CO2 emissions.  This sector showed a 5.2% increase from 2005 to 2006, which is 165% above the 1990 transport emission levels.  I note the Minister's latest statistics indicate it is 180% higher than the 1990 levels.  In any case, there has been a rapid increase in emissions stemming from high levels of transport activity.  The Environmental Protection Agency's report confirms that 97% of transport emissions can be accredited to road transport.  This is music to the ears of the Minister because we know he does not have a high regard for road users and motorists generally.  This is reflected in the increases in petrol and diesel consumption rising continually year after year.</p>

          <p eId="para_590">The increase in emissions in the transport sector is so much that it is making any overall reduction target, Government or otherwise, difficult to meet.  This situation did not happen overnight and it is not a surprise to policymakers, environmentalists or even commuters.  Years of under-funding and lack of investment in our public transport have cost us dearly, not only in CO2 emissions but also in traffic congestion and commuter times.  I could spend the rest of my contribution detailing all that is wrong and inadequate with public transport, from delayed metro lines and disconnected Luas lines to bus monopolies.  Commuters, however, are left with no choice but to get into their cars and travel into gridlock because the Government has not given them any choice.  The Minister now intends to fix the transport emissions problem by increasing car tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">This Bill is no more or less than a revenue-raising exercise.  To be fair to the Minister he has acknowledged that and admits it readily.  He got the opportunity to do a few other things, which I will deal with later.  He could have included other matters in the legislation but primarily the Bill aims to encourage people to purchase low-emission cars after 1 July 2008 and make some impact on the current unsustainable level of carbon dioxide from car exhausts around the country.  This part of the Bill is welcome and is one we can support.  However, the Green Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has taken this concept and made it slightly meaningless in the Bill.  The first part of this Bill — in giving a legislative basis for the motor tax increases recently brought in on all cars, based on the size of their engines — is a perfect example of the Minister saying one thing and doing another.  The Minister would have us believe this Bill is the be all and end all of reducing car emissions, which of course it is not.  The Bill does not reward or encourage consumers who have already made a conscious environmental decision to buy a new or second-hand car with low carbon dioxide emissions.  The blanket tax increases of 9.5% for cars with engines up to 2.5 litres do not fit with the Minister's objective of encouraging people to be more environmentally aware.  If the Minister was happy to increase the tax on a small car by 9.5% one could be forgiven for thinking the Minister would greatly increase the tax on larger cars but he did not do so.  He only increased tax on cars above 2.5 litres by 11%.  Some people may wish to purchase cars over 2.5 litres if they have the money to do so, and in such cases I would have sympathy with increasing tax on those vehicles.  However, the 11% tax increase on larger vehicles will not make much difference to consumer choice.</p>

          <p eId="para_593">I will come to that in a minute.  If the Minister was serious about encouraging people to buy smaller and cleaner cars, he should have frozen the lower tax rates.  At the very least he should have made up the shortfall on larger vehicles, and there would be sound environmental reasons for doing so, but he did not do that.  The Bill as drafted implies that cars of 1.1 litres are as clean as those with 2.4 litre engines.  Of the 180,754 cars registered in Ireland in 2007, only 10,295 were above 2.4 litres.  If the Minister disagrees with my assessment of his intentions then he should introduce more graduated tax bands as part of this Bill that would reward people's choice of smaller cars in the 1.1 to 1.6 litre range.  Instead, the Minister is intent on hiking small car taxes up to the same level as bigger vehicles which, in large measure, cause more pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">We have a lot of thinking to do as regards how we will deal with motor tax bands in future.  It would seem, however, that the Minister has learned a lot in his short time in Government with his Fianna Fáil masters, as these car tax increases have less to do with saving the environment than with raising hard cash to meet the shortfall in his Department's Estimate, which he was given by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in the latter part of 2007.  This increase in motor tax represents a direct stealth tax of €83 million hitting every household and family in the country.  Only €53 million of that money will be given back as an increase in this year's local government fund.  He was forced to raise this revenue because the Minister for Finance said he did not have the money to give the Minister, and would only give so much.  I am sure the Minister offered the possibility of raising motor tax to assist the Minister for Finance in his financial forecasts and Estimates for 2008.</p>

          <p eId="para_596">All the rhetoric and soft talk seeks only to camouflage the fact that this legislation is a money-raising exercise.  This is not a green tax.  It will not help us meet our emission reduction targets or help the environment.  The only benefit is that it will help to balance the books for the Minister and for the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The European Commission sent a warning shot across the Government's bow yesterday in regard to our impending economic difficulties and expected budget deficits.  Instead of properly managing the economy and raising our economic competitiveness, the Government seems more likely to take the easy option of imposing yet another stealth tax.  It seeks to spend its way out of trouble when it comes to our declining finances.  The price of failure, however, will be placed squarely on the shoulders of those largely responsible for the Celtic tiger, namely, workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The Minister spoke about the objectives of the motor tax.  I am aware he does not like motor cars but these provisions suggest he does not like motorists either.  Since the budget, consumers have made fundamental decisions on the choice of car to purchase based on their understanding of the provisions the Minister would introduce.  However, he has given motorists who made good environmental decisions no reward for doing so.  One of several letters I have received on this issue summarises the matter well.  The author, Mr. Murphy, states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_599">As an early adopter of the green message, I ordered a diesel vehicle before the Minister's pronouncements with the full intention and knowledge that I was doing my piece for the environment.  My new car's CO2 rating is certified at 128g which would mean, under the new regime, a VRT reduction from 30% to 16% and an annual motor tax reduction from approximately €560 per annum to €90 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">However, the lifetime restriction means this person will not receive the benefit of acting on his environmental concerns unless he buys a new car after 1 July 2008.  Motorists were given little information on the new regime.</p>

          <p eId="para_607">The lifetime restriction, whereby a low emissions vehicle is taxed heavily as against the same model purchased five months later with the same CO2 rating, is a gross injustice.  The difference can run to thousands of euro.  This injustice is compounded by the fact that imported second-hand cars with the relevant CO2 clearance are to be taxed after 1 July on emissions rather than engine capacity.  This means a car bought in the United Kingdom on the same date as a diesel car purchased in February 2008 can be imported into the State and subsequently taxed for its lifetime at a much lower monetary rate.  The system is unfair.</p>

          <p eId="para_609">Furthermore, it leaves the possibility that a car purchased in the State prior to 1 July 2008 could be exported and then imported again after that date and thus be subject to the lower taxation rate.  This is an anomaly.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The Minister recently stated in a parliamentary reply:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_611">In addition, it is essential that there is certainty and accuracy in terms of CO2 ratings.  Under both the new motor tax and VRT systems, the CO2 rating will be based on the car's certificate of conformity, under EU type approval law.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">In the light of this clear statement, it seems the door is open to car purchasers who have a valid CO2 certificate, prior to 1 July, to reclaim the difference in VRT between the higher cc based rate and the CO2 rate and, furthermore, to have the car's annual tax rescheduled at the CO2 rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">There is another anomaly.  Given the contribution motor transport makes to CO2 emissions, if the Minister is concerned about meeting our emissions reduction targets, why did he not ask the Minister for Finance, in the context of the Finance Bill, to reform the benefit-in-kind scheme?  The more one drives, the greater one's contribution to CO2 emissions.  However, anybody who requires a car for their business is encouraged to drive as many miles as possible to meet the threshold for drawing down the maximum benefit-in-kind.  This is against everything we seek to achieve.  A modest change to this regime would have made a major contribution.  An opportunity has been missed.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I am amazed to read in one of the newspapers today about the latest conversion of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI.  It welcomed the budget announcement but has been getting it in the neck since from motor dealers as a consequence of the uncertainty that was created.  The VRT changes should have been introduced on 1 January.  If people are going to purchase a new car, they tend to do so in the early months of the year when the new year registration is still novel.  There will probably be a spike in sales in the first several weeks after the provisions are introduced in July.  After that, however, people will wait until 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Motor dealers are encountering great confusion among consumers.  In addition, there is no clarity from the Revenue Commissioners in regard to labelling.  The Revenue Commissioners seem entirely confused as to how they will implement this regime.  Like motor dealers, they have no information to give to consumers.  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry would be better off trying to get answers to these questions for the benefit of consumers than belatedly seeking amendments to the scheme.  I welcome SIMI's conversion to the reality of the situation, which has been related to it by dealers.  The utopia it expected to arise on 1 July has been replaced by the realisation that a mistake has been made.  The proposals have created genuine confusion and problems for customers and dealers.  The SIMI now seeks an amendment to allow people who purchase a car before 1 July to be taxed at the new rate.  We must give people the benefit for decisions they make now.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The Minister claims his CO2 based car tax system is a green tax that will reward people for buying clean cars.  However, this applies only if one is well off and can afford a new car, as only those who purchase new cars can take advantage of this new system.  Purchasing a new car is a major decision, which one does not make every year unless one has a company car.  Consumers change their cars every three years, on average.  It is a significant decision to spend a large amount of disposable income net of tax on what is essentially a luxury item but which is essential for many people given the lack of reliable public transport.  The Minister has not given the benefit to those who make the purchase before 1 July, regardless of whether it is a second-hand or new car.  Not everyone purchases a brand new car.  As soon as one drives a new car out of the garage it has already decreased in value by some €2,500.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">We must co-operate as best we can to facilitate a regime where motorists are rewarded for purchasing cars that serve to facilitate our overall objective of reducing CO2 emissions, regardless of whether they are new or second-hand or when they are purchased.  There will be a significant reduction in the contribution from motor tax to the local government fund next year if people take the right action in terms of adjusting their purchases along the lines of the VRT and motor tax bands.  The Minister will then have an even more difficult time with the Minister for Finance when it comes to the Estimates for 2009.  We will deal with that when we come to it.  This is the type of approach that must be taken if we are serious about tackling the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I am sure the Minister will engage in consultation with the haulage sector.  Putting freight on rail is the way to go and would make an enormous contribution in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  We have not yet heard from the Minister or the Minister for Transport how the haulage sector will be required to make its contribution to reducing emissions.  I understand an announcement on sustainable transport will be made in the near future, possibly next week.  Perhaps this matter can be addressed at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The Minister has resisted the calls for retrospection by claiming that it is not possible, under this legislation, to implement a regime that would allow people to benefit retrospectively from lower emissions.  I suggest that there is a way around that.  On 21 August 2001, one of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Noel Dempsey, made it law that the CO2 output of a car per kilometre, as well as information on the car's fuel consumption, has to be displayed at any new car's point of sale.  Therefore, information on CO2 output per kilometre for any car that is on the road since August 2001 should be known and could easily be transferred into the new CO2 car tax system.  If the Minister is serious about helping those who make sound environmental decisions, he will consider using the information that is available to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">I do not think the current proposals will help us to meet our objective of decreasing emissions from the motor transport sector.  The Government's climate change strategy predicts that the rebalancing of VRT and car tax in favour of greener cars will save an average of 50,000 tonnes of CO2 a year, which is just a drop in the ocean when we are trying to save 8 million tonnes.  To put it in context, CO2 emissions from the transport sector have increased by 682,000 tonnes in the past year.  We could go much further with this measure, which will save just 50,000 tonnes, while meeting the objectives of the transport sector to a greater extent than we are doing at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">I hope that the Minister will consider some of the suggestions we have made and rectify some of the anomalies we have highlighted.  If he makes a meaningful effort to give financial benefits to people who are genuinely interested in doing their bit for the environment, he will get the co-operation of Deputies on this side of the House.  That is the kernel of my approach.  The Government's objective, as outlined in the programme for Government, of achieving a 3% reduction in carbon emissions will look like a pipe dream if we do not fast-track certain measures.  We need to ensure that people feel the benefit of their environmentally friendly behaviour in their pockets.  The window of opportunity that exists to avail of the goodwill of people who want to make the right decisions, in the interests of reducing our CO2 emissions, might not last for a considerable period of time.  Deputies regularly receive letters from people who are concerned about the anomalies they encounter when trying to act in an environmentally considerate manner.  Such problems defeat the purpose of the changes which were made to VRT and motor tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">It seems that these measures are being introduced simply to increase motor tax receipts.  Taxpayers will not feel the benefits of the sound environmental decisions they make between now and 1 July.  I have decided to oppose this legislation for those reasons.  On Committee Stage, I will propose ways of improving the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will reflect on our suggestions, which reflect the genuine concerns of consumers, in advance of that debate.  People are entitled to get the benefit of the sound environmental decisions they make when purchasing cars.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">I think it was George Bernard Shaw who said "If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter".  Unfortunately, there is an exception to every rule.  In the case of this legislation, 30 minutes is not sufficient to cover every issue I would like to raise.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Is this Bill a revenue-driven exercise, if Deputies will pardon the pun, or is it an environment-driven exercise?  As Deputy Hogan said, the measures being proposed have revenue and environmental implications.  Everyone concedes that the proposal to base car tax and vehicle registration tax on CO2 emissions, rather than on an outmoded and arbitrary distinction between various engine sizes, has some merit.  There is overwhelming support for this aspect of the Bill throughout the House.  However, the Minister's proposal does not comprise a total review of motor taxation.  The manner in which the Bill is being presented to the House creates a number of anomalies and inequities.  The Labour Party will seek to rectify such problems by proposing amendments on Committee and Report Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">In the time available to me, I will refer to the serious concerns that have been expressed about the ineffectiveness of the proposed changes in reducing carbon emissions.  These proposals will potentially have an unfair effect on families.  There is a danger that this legislation will penalise the owners of large family cars who are not in a position to buy a new car, which would be unfair.  Those who own larger cars with cleaner emissions will have to pay more tax than those who own smaller cars which are less environmentally friendly.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">In recent years, there has been a clear need for a new policy direction on energy efficiency in the transport sector.  This Bill sets out the direction in which we will go in the future.  People need incentives to make better environmental choices.  It is disappointing that transport energy efficiency increased by less than 1% between 1995 and 2005, particularly as the programme for Government set a target of making energy savings of 20% by 2020.  I hope this Bill will indicate how we can improve our performance in this area.  The Minister needs to clarify his emission rate targets.  How will this legislation help us to meet the 2020 target set in the programme for Government?  Will performance indicators be set or is it just something that is in the moment?</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The AA made a number of substantial points in the submission it made to the Minister on this Bill.  It argued that there is too much taxation on the purchase and ownership of cars, rather than taxation on usage.  The restricted availability of flexifuel in many parts of the country is one of the difficulties faced by those who own environmentally friendly cars.  I understand that just one petrol station in Cork sells flexifuel.  If we are to consider tax incentives, we should focus on this area.  The AA submission also states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_629">In essence it (the Minister's proposal) falls into the ‘Catch 22' of eco-taxes, whereby the more effective a measure is at its stated purpose of improving the environment the less revenue it raises.  Faced with this choice between the two, both Departments have chosen to preserve the revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">That is the point I made at the outset.  This Bill must be driven by environmental considerations, rather than being a revenue-driven exercise.  If it is revenue driven, it will completely undermine what it is supposed to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">The AA suggests that any attempt to call vehicle registration tax an environmental tax represents a misunderstanding of the original reasons for its introduction.  According to the AA:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_632">VRT came about because Vehicle Excise Duty was cynically renamed to avoid Ireland's Single European Market commitments.  It would be still more cynical to evade the concerns of the consumer and the European Commission by renaming the tax again as a ‘Carbon Levy' or some similar piece of sophistry.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">In our consideration of this Bill, we need to examine what vehicle registration tax is.  It should work as a once-off addition to the purchase price, based on the engine size.  It was introduced for certain reasons and is being retained for those reasons.  This legislation does not change the rationale for its initial introduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The Labour Party will seek to rectify the anomalies in the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2008, as it is being considered today, during the debate on Committee and Report Stages.  This legislation provides for changes in the rates of car tax and introduces a system whereby the amount of tax payable on a car will be linked to its emissions.  Those are the two key points underpinning the Bill.  Several aspects of the legislation are poorly thought-out and will create a number of anomalies.  For example, motorists who currently drive cars with low emissions will not benefit from these measures.  Similarly, motorists who buy used cars with low emissions, rather than new cars, will not benefit from these proposals.  Since the introduction of the national car test, the average car is well in excess of a decade on the road.  Therefore, the current and future owners of cars which were registered for the first time in recent weeks will not benefit from the proposed changes for the next ten or 12 years.  If someone who cannot afford to buy a new car decides to buy a second-hand eco-friendly car in 12 months, 18 months, two years, six years or eight years' time, he or she will never benefit from this legislation.  The extent to which such people will be penalised will depend on their incomes and the value of the cars they can afford.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The lack of retrospection in the Bill is a serious concern.  The benefits of lower taxes will not apply to those who currently own low emission cars.  If one buys a low emission car in July, one will be liable to pay €100 tax annually for the lifetime of the car.  However, if a person purchases the same car before July, given dealers have the same cars in their forecourts now that they will have in July, he or she will be subject to a different tariff system, which the Labour Party believes is iniquitous and unfair.  He or she will never benefit from this taxation system proposed in the legislation.  In general, second-hand cars, regardless of how low are their emissions, will be taxed at higher rates into the foreseeable future and, therefore, people on lower incomes who buy such cars will never benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">There are further implications.  Second-hand cars sourced in the Republic of Ireland will be taxed at the old rate while second-hand cars sourced in the North or abroad will be taxed at the new lower rates.  Second-hand car dealers must be seriously asking themselves about their future.  If I were a car dealer along the Border, I know where I would relocate in the next six months and where I would source cars from for the foreseeable future.  The imported car will be liable for the lower rate of car tax compared with an identical model bought here, which means the new system will penalise the owners of used low emission cars, who acted responsibly in the first place, by making it difficult for them to sell their car on the second-hand market as a private citizen or to a dealer.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">While I wholeheartedly agree with the principle underpinning these changes, it is clear they have been rushed and not thought out.  It is imperative and necessary that the Minister re-examines the Bill to iron out these difficulties.  The problem with taxing cars on the basis of CO2 emissions is they are a moving target.  According to the Department of Finance's briefing notes to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, almost 65% of all cars sold in 2005 produced between 146g and 190g of CO2 per kilometre.  Almost 14% produced more than 190g, which is in the high pollution category, and only 3.85% were in the low engined category, producing less than 125 g.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">Flexi-fuel cars such as the Minister's or dual energy system cars, which the taxpayer pays for, account for 5% of the national fleet and because this is such an insignificant number, the anomalies that exist could be ironed out and resolved.  The broader difficulty is this percentage will change significantly in years to come.  It is predicted that by the end of the decade at least 60% of cars on our roads will come under this new taxation measure.  Industry analysts predict CO2 emissions will reduce further, which means the revenue the Minister perceives will derive from this measure will fall over that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">There are two significant aspects to this.  The first is the impact this will have on local government because the tax take in this regard will reduce.  The motor industry will respond and predictions relating to diesel vehicles over the next few years are that the levels of emissions will be so much smaller that the tax on large engined cars will reduce.  Jaguar is launching a diesel model shortly, which will have a lower CO2 emissions rate than the Fiat 500, which was launched recently and which has an engine size one quarter the size of the Jaguar.  If Jaguar can manufacture such an engine, every other manufacturer will match it, which will result in a significant depreciation in tax revenue, creating further difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Second, those who wish to buy the largest gas guzzler they can get their hands on will receive a windfall because between now and July no matter how large engined a car they buy, they will not be penalised even though they know this legislation is coming down the line.  Anyone who bought a large engined car prior to the announcement of these changes should not be penalised for the decisions they made blindly but the notion that somebody can buy such a car now and not be penalised for doing so is a major anomaly and it undermines the intent of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I refer to the 5% of motorists who bought ecofriendly cars with the greatest motivation.  They did so for the right reason.  Unfortunately, the Bill has more stick than carrot for them.  They did something out of positive motivation, yet they will never benefit from the new taxation system.  If they sell the car to a dealer, the return will be poor or should they wish to sell it privately, they will not benefit.  Last autumn, the Minister set his own example by purchasing a hybrid car.  It is unfortunate that more of his ministerial colleagues did not follow his lead.  I noticed a number of large gas guzzling 2008 cars walking out of the Leinster House complex last night.  It would be interesting to audit them to ascertain their emission levels.  While the Minister has taken a lead on this, what differentiates him from other motorists who drive hybrid and ecofriendly cars is they have paid for them out of their own pockets and they will continue to pay for the anomalies in this legislation out of their own pockets for the next ten to 12 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The Labour Party will table amendments.  Deputy Hogan referred to the kilometre evaluation system, which is of particular relevance to diesel cars.  The deletion of the words "on or after 1 July 2008" on page 3 and "on or after 1 July 2008" on page 9 would rectify the anomalies to which I referred because those references will penalise the 5% of motorists who did the right thing and bought environmentally friendly cars in recent years.  Massive changes are not required in this because 5% is a not a large number.  All that would be required is to ensure local motor tax offices have a procedure in place so that when these motorists renew their motor taxation, they will be subject to the new rates and not the higher rates in place when they purchased their cars.  Less than 5% of motorists are affected by this anomaly, which is a small number, and this can be sorted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The Minister also referred to the difficulties in providing a fairer system in his contribution.  One clear response to this is the categories for grading cars from 1 July will not change and, therefore, I am not sure what the Minister means by his reference to a fair system.  The specifications, the printing of the manuals and the documentation which accompanies the brochures will not change after 1 July.  This information is set out in the catalogue of every car purchased, so there is no difficulty in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The second-hand car market reveals an anomaly in that cars imported from Japan will not qualify under the Bill.  Cars coming off the Toyota assembly line in Tokyo may be destined for different markets but they are manufactured under the same process.  It is ridiculous that two cars which are made side by side will not qualify equally under the same criteria.  The Minister should re-examine this area with a view to bringing clarity because it reveals an absence in the Bill as drafted.  I am sure he did not intend this anomaly.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Since the introduction of the NCT and alongside the improvement in road quality, this country's motoring culture has completely changed in terms of the lifespan of modern cars.  I refer to a parliamentary question I put to the Minister for Finance last year.  Some 1.5 million people in this country earn less than €38,000 per year, the equivalent of the wage increase the Taoiseach proposed to give himself.  On that modest wage, it is difficult to purchase a new car on an annual or even a biannual basis.  Most people in that earning category also face high mortgage repayments.  After the family home, a new car is the most expensive purchase made in the majority of people's lifetimes.  Environmentally friendly cars bought before 1 July will never be an attractive purchase for people in this wage category.  The Minister is preventing people who cannot afford a new car from using financial incentives to do the right thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">Can the Minister indicate the options he considered?  I understand three options were available in terms of changing the system.  The first involved the entire fleet but significant difficulties would have arisen if the changes were made on that basis from 1 January because those who bought cars prior to the introduction of the legislation would have been penalised.  The second option was to cherrypick cars that would qualify, while the third option was the cut-off date.  Why is the Minister so adamant on the cut-off date despite failing to consider further options that would improve his proposals?  If he had introduced flexibility to the area, he would have resolved the difficulties I describe.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Deputy Hogan referred to the benefit-in-kind scheme.  Prior to the introduction of the Bill, a friend of mine who works in the sales industry noted that sales people have an incentive to drive as far as possible in order to clock up miles and minimise their benefit-in-kind payments.  We should introduce a taxation system which reduces emissions levels.  At present, unnecessary journeys are being taken by sales people at the end of each month because their clocks are not in line with their benefit-in-kind calculations.  Deputy Hogan can attest to this practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_649">As those who work in the sales industry tend to drive company cars, mileage and depreciation is not an issue for them.  The Minister must address this issue in the context of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">If the Bill is intended as a means to incentivise the Irish driving public to make environmentally friendly choices, the Labour Party welcomes it.  However, it has revenue implications for every household in the country.  At present, the tax on a 1.6 litre car ranges between €350 and €450 per annum.  The new system allows for significant reductions on that amount on cars with reduced emission levels.  That is a substantial sum of money for any household earning €38,000.  Legislation such as this is often drawn up by people who do not pay for the cars they drive or the fuel they put in their engines.  They are not necessarily aware of what the rest of the driving public has to endure on a daily basis.  Ireland is one of the most expensive countries in Europe to purchase a car because of VRT.  For many years, people have purchased cars outside the State in order to avoid VRT.  The Bill offers further incentives for purchasing second-hand cars outside the State, with implications for new and, in particular, second-hand car sales.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I hope we will look back on this Bill as a milestone in the transformation of Irish driving culture rather than an opportunity missed because anomalies were not rectified.  I suggest that the Minister address these anomalies.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_653">Overall, education expenditure will rise by 8%, or €690 million, to €9.3 billion in 2008.  This will enable us to consolidate the major service improvements that have been put in place in recent years and make further progress in a wide range of areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">On the 2008 budget, the Deputy will be aware of the importance the Government placed on carefully managing the public finances in the context of more moderate economic growth so that improvements can be sustained in the future.   In this context, the provision of an additional €690 million for education services in the 2008 budget over the amount allocated in budget 2007 is significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">The €9.3 billion being allocated in respect of education in 2008 includes provision for further progress in the following areas: almost €600 million will be invested in school buildings; funding for approximately 1,700 extra teachers and special needs assistants will be provided; expenditure on special education will increase to twice the 2004 amount; €800 million will be spent on tackling educational disadvantage; schools will receive increased funding to meet their day-to-day running costs; capital investment in our higher education colleges will increase by more than 20%; and an additional €12 million will be provided for research to ensure that Ireland is well placed to develop the technologies, processes and products that will be central to our future social and economic success.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">While I would like to have been in a position to make greater progress this year on some of the specific commitments in the five-year programme for Government, particularly those relating to school funding and primary class sizes, I am nonetheless satisfied that the 2008 budget allocation of over €9.3 billion will enable me to progress the key overall objectives contained in the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_657">The Minister is aware that clear commitments were given in the programme for Government in respect of an increase of €350 million per year for educational services.  She failed to make this increase available in the context of this year's Estimates.  The Minister also alluded to the fact that there will be no reduction in primary class sizes this year.  In addition, she failed to admit the fact that in her manifesto she promised a reduction in class sizes at post-primary level in respect of the core subjects of Irish, English and mathematics.  Of these three broken promises, which is the one that most disappoints the Minister?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_658">The third commitment to which the Deputy refers is due to be delivered upon over the lifetime of the Government and it will be met during that period.  On the first two commitments, no one in the House anticipated the slowdown that occurred in the economy.  Everything in the programme for Government is predicated on strong economic growth.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance had an obligation to ensure that, via the budget, improvements could be maintained into the future and a similar obligation rests with Ministers in other Departments.  It would not be sufficient for people to congratulate the Tánaiste on keeping a tight rein on expenditure and ensuring that it is well focused, as is the case in the area of education, while stating that all other Departments should spend money willy-nilly.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">It is our intention to meet all our commitments under the programme for Government.  I would like to have done more in respect of school funding, particularly in light of the time-specific aspect, and on class sizes.  However, an additional 1,100 teachers will be employed next year.  We made a specific commitment in the programme for Government that an extra 4,000 teachers would be employed during the term of office of this Administration.  When one takes into account the number of new teachers employed last September and the number that will be taken on in September of this year, we will already be half way towards reaching our goal in this regard.  While we may not reach the specific target for this year, we will reach the target as regards the number of additional teachers to be employed this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">I have highlighted the two commitments in respect of which I would like to have done more.  However, it is our intention to meet these commitments during the lifetime of the programme for Government.  The additional €690 million is a significant amount of money.</p>

            <p eId="para_661">Does the Minister not accept that any independent commentator would come to the conclusion that she has a real problem with the allocation of funding she received from the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance?  One need not be the smartest cookie in the class to realise that if one seeks €315 million, the amount referred to in the programme, and one receives less than one third of that amount in respect of educational services, it is not a good day at the office.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">Deputy Hanafin is the first Minister for Education and Science in ten years to introduce swingeing cutbacks in the education budget.  I refer specifically to the summer works scheme, which has effectively been abolished this year.  Will the Minister provide a clear commitment to the House in respect of the devolved grant, about which her Department has been extremely quiet to date this year?  Will the grant be in place for this year and when will schools be in a position to draw down funding under it?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_195" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_663">There are no cutbacks in education.  There is an increase of 8%, €690 million, in our budget.  The education system is extensive and I was concerned to ensure that all levels within it would receive an increase.  Previous Ministers might have determined not to provide increases in respect of third or fourth level education, but I see such behaviour as having a significant impact, not only on our society as it stands, but also on the future of our economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">The summer works scheme did not proceed this year, but last year 1,500 projects were completed under the scheme.  An amount of work and effort was invested in the smaller projects.  I have an obligation to ensure that the larger projects proceed this year.  Such projects are particularly relevant to areas with growing communities.  One obviously expends a significant amount of money in the first year following the commencement of projects of this nature.  This is particularly the case in view of the fact that we are seeking to ensure that schools are put in place in the various new communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">I made a policy decision in respect of this matter.  Smaller projects were completed in the past couple of years and larger projects will commence this year.  We will return, as soon as possible, to the summer works scheme, which is extremely important.</p>

        <b>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         if, in view of recent newspaper reports regarding draft procedures to deal with primary school teachers who are not meeting or adhering to required or satisfactory standards being prepared within her Department, she will formally consult the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, before finalising her Department’s recommendations on this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [6034/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_209" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_680">The reputation of the education system, both nationally and internationally, attests to the dedication, skill and competence of Irish teachers generally.  It is recognised that while the majority of teachers fulfil their teaching function and professional duties adequately and well, there are, as in all professions, a small number of underperforming personnel in schools.  As part of the modernisation agenda for teachers under the social partnership agreement Towards 2016, it was agreed to address the issue of difficulties in relation to teacher performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_681">Teachers are employed by the board of management of each individual school or in the case of the vocational education sector by the individual vocational education committee.  Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 provides that a board of management of a school may suspend or dismiss teachers in accordance with procedures agreed from time to time between the Minister, the patron of the school, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union representing teachers.  In that context and as one element of addressing issues of underperformance, discussions under the auspices of the Teachers Conciliation Council have commenced to review and revise existing procedures for the suspension and dismissal of teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">The Teachers Conciliation Council is the recognised forum for dealing with matters relating to pay and conditions of service for teachers.  The parties to the forum include representatives of the managerial authorities of schools, the teacher unions and the Departments of Education and Science and Finance.  The forum is, therefore, representative of employers and employees, as is usual in industrial relations matters.  The procedures, when agreed, will provide fair and effective mechanisms in respect of the small number of cases where serious underperformance arises.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">The representative body for school principals on industrial relations matters is the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO.  While it remains open to principals to make their views known to the INTO, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me, as Minister, to open up an alternative process of negotiation to that already agreed and in place under the Teachers Conciliation Council.</p>

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_210">
            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_684">I thank the Minister for her reply.  The preamble was perhaps unnecessary, particularly in view of the time constraints.  I put it to the Minister that the tone of her reply is in complete contrast to that of the eulogistic address she delivered at the IPPN conference in Killarney, which I attended, when she stated that principals are the leaders of the schools.  The Minister is now saying the leaders of the schools have no role to play in the definition, design and structures that would deal with the problem.  It may be a problem for the minority but it is very big for parents whose child happens to be in a class or for the principal of a small school where for personal, family or external reasons, a teacher is not performing.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">Is the Minister stating the INTO rules the roost on these matters and when it comes to the formal involvement in negotiations or discussions, the IPPN has no place whatever?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_211" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_686">As Deputy Quinn correctly stated, I spoke to the principals at the conference and rightly stated the principals are the leaders of the schools.  The IPPN is a professional association of school leaders and a body I have much time for.  It does a significant amount of networking around the country in supporting principals and working with them but it is not the recognised body for industrial relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">Principals are recognised and are working through the INTO in this process.  On a formal basis, which is the question the Deputy asked, there is no role for the IPPN.  There is of course a role for the views of principals, which are being taken on board as they come from principals and professionals.  The INTO acts on their behalf as the recognised trade union in all these talks.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_212">
            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_688">If the INTO represents the teachers and the boards of management represent the patrons, who represents the children and parents?  All I am asking is whether the Minister will either formally or informally consult with the IPPN before signing off the new and welcome procedures.  I use the word "informally" to get around the structure inherited by the Minister which she did not design.  She may be a prisoner of it.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_213" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_689">A very important factor is that the views of principals are taken on board.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_214">
            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_215" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_691">It does not matter which body represents those views, as long as the view is put across.  The body principals have chosen to represent them is the INTO, the officially recognised trade union.  At a meeting with the IPPN, representatives gave their views on an informal basis.  There is absolutely no possibility of setting up a parallel structure when the INTO is the formal group representing principals and teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">On the broader issue of who represents the children, the best way of doing this is to get agreement on this issue very quickly.  We all know it concerns a few people but they can have a serious impact in class.  We can reach agreement on this over the next couple of months.</p>

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_216">
            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_693">The Minister did not answer the question.  How can she say, when nobody is representing the children, that the best way to get representation for children is to get agreement by the players around the table, none of whom ostensibly represents the children?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_696">I am answering the question.  The best way of supporting the children is to ensure they have professional teachers in the classroom.  By supporting those teachers professionally, through in-service and the welfare service available to them, as well as by having this process in place, we have the best way of ensuring the underperforming teacher is removed from the classroom and the teaching of children.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">There have been ways over the past number of years that still exist where teachers can go out on permanent leave, effectively, through strands 1, 2 and 3.  Approximately 700 teachers took that last year.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         her views on the appropriateness, or otherwise of poetry (details supplied) remaining on the leaving certificate syllabus in view of the controversy surrounding the case; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_226" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_705">Advice on prescribed material for the junior and leaving cert exams is submitted to the Department of Education and Science by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  Prescribed texts are notified to schools a number of years in advance and must be notified in time to ensure that educational publishers are in a position to provide an adequate supply of texts.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">Poems belonging to the person referred to by the Deputy are on the prescribed list for the 2008 and 2009 leaving certificate examinations.  As students may already have done considerable work on them, it would be unfair to change the list at this stage.  This poet's work has been included in the prescribed texts as it is nationally and internationally recognised.  The NCCA has looked at the poetry and considers it suitable and appropriate for its intended audience.  It will, however, be advising on a new list of prescribed texts for future years.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">The primary criterion for inclusion of texts as part of the prescribed literature is literary merit.  Texts must also be accessible, interesting and challenging for students, and be suitable for assessment in accordance with the learning objectives of the curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">I am aware of the controversy surrounding the poet referred to in the question and I am conscious that I should not make any statements in this House that could be deemed to be prejudicial in the event of any proceedings arising in this matter.  I accept the social, personal and health education course in particular aims to equip students with an awareness of their rights and responsibilities, and the values, knowledge and skills for ethical decision making.  I am also conscious of the need for positive role models for our young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">The issue is complex and must be considered carefully and in a measured way.  I look forward to receiving advice from the NCCA shortly on the texts which should be prescribed for leaving certificate Irish in future years.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_710">In response to the circumstances which arose in this case, the Minister last week said she was shocked and appalled.  She speaks on everyone's behalf in that regard.  Is the Minister aware the film will be put out on RTE in March and come into the public domain?  It is fair to say it could cause a fair degree of controversy in classrooms up and down the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">In her reply, the Minister stated she has asked the NCCA to furnish her with a report, which she is absolutely entitled to do.  Has she considered speaking directly to teachers, parents and students about this?  What advice would she give to teachers who must teach the subject matter when this issue comes into the public domain in March, given there is a fair degree of controversy surrounding this case?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_228" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_712">It would be the wrong interpretation to say I have asked the NCCA for a report, as it does that every time new prescribed texts must be provided.  The course is due to change anyway, to be given to schools for September of next year, for inclusion in the leaving certificate course for the next batch of fifth years and sixth years.  It is part of the body's regular work.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">As the Deputy said, I am quite shocked and appalled at what I have read in newspapers.  I have not yet seen the film.  The inclusion of any literature on a paper as part of a course must be looked at on its literary merit, as has been stated.  As a former teacher who taught these poems, I can understand the case could prove difficult for teachers.  The students are 17 or 18 years old, who equally have been trained to evaluate and discuss such issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">I hope and believe the NCCA will take all these issues on board, including the merit of the literature, the teaching of it and the circumstances that would arise in a classroom.  When it decides on courses and literature to be included in a course, there is a committee made up of teachers which advises on each of the subject areas.  All those issues would be taken into account.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_229">
            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_715">My understanding is the Minister ultimately has power over the curriculum.  She takes advice from the NCCA but what is on the curriculum is ultimately a departmental decision.  Does the Minister believe it appropriate that this poet's work remains on the curriculum, given the circumstances alluded to in the national press?</p>
            <p eId="para_716">I put to her a comment made to me by a teacher recently.  She stated that if similar circumstances involving a teacher, a principal or school manager came to public attention, that person would not be left in a school setting.  Why should we have one yardstick for teaching professionals and another for poets?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_717">This concerns the age old question of literature.  There might be questions about the character of many people whose literature has been on courses for the past 100 years.  This is different, however, because it is a current case involving a person living in this country.  Students must answer one question about the poet, which could cause difficulty.  The merit of the poetry is not at issue because it is recognised nationally and internationally.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_718">The Minister has ultimate power in this matter and must take advice from the NCCA.  Is her position that this poet's work will remain on the curriculum and that there could well be a question about it over the next two years?  Does the Minister have any intention of changing that?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_719">It is not open to me to change something that is on the course.  This is February and leaving certificate students are finalising or revising their course so the work remains part of that course until next June.  It is also part of the fifth year course.  That syllabus was established a couple of years ago.  When I say that the NCCA advises me on it, I do not know of any situation, nor would any be desirable, in which a Minister for Education and Science would determine what should be on the course.  If that was the case, we could all interfere with the syllabus.</p>

I am satisfied that the NCCA will take into account not just the literary merit of the poetry, but also its suitability for the age group being taught and for the teachers in the classroom, bearing in mind that the literature and the life of the poet must be understood.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_735">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Where accommodation is needed at very short notice, however, a temporary solution can be the only option.  Such accommodation may also be used where the need is short term, such as when a school requires a temporary building while it is awaiting the completion of construction of permanent facilities.  Last year, only 5% of the total investment in school buildings went on the rental of temporary accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">This year, almost €600 million will be invested in school buildings and construction work will take place which is expected to provide permanent accommodation for about 20,000 pupils when complete.  In the past, newly-recognised schools have generally had to open in temporary accommodation.  I have been anxious to move away from this approach in developing areas and this year we are working hard to open as many new schools as possible in permanent accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">Department officials have been working in partnership with local authority staff to acquire sites needed for new schools next September.  Considerable effort has also been invested in pre-planning discussions with a view to ironing out any difficulties that might otherwise have been experienced at planning permission stage.  I also held productive meetings with several county managers and their senior planners and appreciate the effort that they have put into working with us on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">Sites for each of the September 2008 projects have been identified and site master-plans have been developed by the technical teams.  Our aim, where possible, is to put permanent solutions in place on a phased basis to meet the immediate September 2008 needs with a second phase to follow as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">Permanent solutions will be possible where a long-term site has been secured.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">A significant amount of building work on the new schools is being done off-site.  The successful tenderers for the construction of each individual project have been notified.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">Project teams which were recruited from the private sector in October 2007 have been tasked with preparing the planning applications, undertaking the necessary surveys and overseeing the delivery of the schools on each site.  To conclude, expenditure on temporary accommodation has tended to represent a very small proportion of the overall investment in school buildings in recent years.  The use of prefabs is avoided where possible but sometimes they can be the only feasible option.  We are now working to ensure that, where possible, new schools in developing areas will open in permanent accommodation from the start.</p>

            <p eId="para_743">The Minister's reply is a total and utter disgrace and an insult to this House.  Her insistence on reading it into the Official Report and taking up my scarce time to block any significant supplementary question is the kind of abuse that I brought to the attention of the Ceann Chomhairle when the Minister was in the House yesterday.  I asked the Minister a simple question — if any of the Minister's previous pupils had given the reply that she has given in the junior or leaving certificate, they would have got an F for failure.  Is the Minister seriously telling me that the entire Department of Education and Science cannot say how many prefabricated buildings there are in the primary school system, <i>simpliciter</i>?  Is it 1,000 or 5,000?  There are 3,300 schools — is the figure 10% or 20% and, if so, what age are the buildings?  Is the Minister saying the information is not readily available?</p>

            <p eId="para_746">The situation is exactly as I have outlined to the Deputy.  All the information is held on individual files in the Department and there are approximately 3,200 files on primary schools so I cannot give him a ready answer.  I have given him the amount of money spent, which is only 5% of the overall budget.  We are undertaking a review within the Department, as part of which we are examining each individual file to get the information necessary to consider issues such as the break-even point, introducing a buy-out, the most economical approach, and renting as opposed to purchasing.</p>

            <p eId="para_748">I assure the Deputy that as soon as the information is available, I will be happy to give it to him.  We do not have a central knowledge of it because individual schools which have individual boards of management are responsible for acquiring the buildings.  They seek permission from the Department, get three tenders, have to take the cheapest tender and then put up the building.  In some cases, the school may no longer have use for the building as a classroom but opt to keep it to use as a store room, etc.  As soon as the information is available, I will be happy to give it to the Deputy if he wishes to ask another question.</p>

        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the progress in terms of extending opportunity to persons who avail of adult education, particularly in view of Government commitments in the Towards 2016 partnership programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [6868/08]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_260" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_758">The Government has prioritised a major expansion of opportunities in adult and further education.  Between 2002 and 2007, expenditure on these areas increased by over 50%, from €256 million to €392 million.  This increased investment helped to improve opportunities by expanding the number of places on further education courses from 44,000 in 2002 to 49,000 in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">These include more than 30,000 places on post-leaving certificate courses; 9,000 places on the back to education initiative; 5,000 on the vocational training opportunities scheme; almost 3,700 Youthreach places; and 1,100 places on training schemes for travellers.  In addition, the adult literacy programme provided for 44,000 learners in 2007 compared to 28,000 in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">Towards 2016 included specific commitments to increase the number of places in the adult literacy programmes, in Youthreach and in the back to education initiative over the period 2007 to 2009.  A total of 3,000 extra adult literacy places were created in 2007 and provision has been made for an extra 500 in 2008.  In addition, arising from the provision for family literacy in the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, action plan funding was provided for seven family literacy projects in 2007.  In Youthreach, an additional 400 places were approved in 2007 and there is provision for 100 more in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">A total of 1,000 extra places also were provided on the back to education initiative, BTEI, last year and fees were abolished for all participants in the BTEI with less than an upper second level education.  In 2008, the Department is providing for 500 more BTEI places.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">Apart from progress on meeting the Towards 2016 commitments, other significant improvements have been made in the further education area in recent years.  The adult guidance initiative has been expanded; funding for child care in further education has been increased, benefiting more than 1,700 students last year; it is estimated that the number of participants on community education programmes has increased from 20,000 in 2002 to 30,000 in 2007; and the number of places on post-leaving certificate courses, PLC, has also increased.  The Government therefore has made substantial progress both in terms of the Towards 2016 commitments and across the further and adult education sector as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">I am particularly conscious of the need to continue to improve second chance opportunities and help people to improve their skills and I assure the Deputy that further improvements in this regard are a priority for me.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ulick Burke</from>
            <p eId="para_764">In earlier replies to Deputies Brian Hayes and Quinn, the Minister clearly indicated the allocation of funds for sections within her Department.  Nowhere however, did she indicate what additional funding was being provided for lifelong learning and adult education despite her commitments in the Towards 2016 partnership programme to put in place a targeted fund to alleviate the fees for part-time third level courses for those at work who have not previously benefitted from third level education.  Her reply never mentioned a statement to the effect she will honour this commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">As for early school leavers, the Minister promised 1,000 places in 2008 for Youthreach.  While she informed Members earlier that there are no cutbacks, her reply, which referred to a provision of less than half that commitment, clearly indicates a cutback provision.</p>

            <p eId="para_767">The likelihood is that these will not be fulfilled either.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">On the question of education in the workplace, it was clearly indicated there would be a commitment to subsidise employers to allow employees to participate in furthering their education.  At present 400,000 members, or 28%, of the workforce have an educational level that is less than junior certificate level and nothing is being done for them.  While the Minister can baffle Members with selective figures if she wishes, she has completely failed in 2008 to honour the commitments she had given.</p>

            <p eId="para_770">I refer to the three points raised.  The budget for adult education is €392 million, which is a highly significant amount and is targeted at a number of different areas because a flexible approach must be adopted to reach that particular cohort of people.  The programme for Government has set out that it must be flexible to cover all the areas I have mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">The Youthreach places will be expanded this year to meet the needs of that group of vulnerable young people.  The Deputy asked about free fees for approved part-time courses, which is a commitment under Towards 2016.  What has happened is that the Higher Education Authority has developed proposals for a modular accreditation programme that allows flexibility in the manner in which people are able to undertake the courses.  Such individuals will receive a substantial fee subsidy as part of that initiative.  Deputy Hayes might be interested to learn the third level institutions intend to start this process in October in Tallaght——</p>

            <p eId="para_774">However, this is a commitment under Towards 2016 and this is 2008.  It will reach out to a particular market.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">The Deputy's third point pertained to workplace literacy.  As he noted, this is an extremely important area.  Because it is based in the workplace, it is being dealt with under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and €3 million has been allocated for this initiative this year.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_269">
            <from>Deputy Ulick Burke</from>
            <p eId="para_776">The Minister must accept that for most participants in adult education and lifelong learning, a series of obstacles exist to prevent access to such initiatives.  I refer to the fees and the costs involved.  In the area of child care, there is no indication that either the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Social and Family Affairs will help to support single parents to return to education in respect of fees and childminding costs while they are involved outside their workplace.  As for the back to education allowance, it was withdrawn two years ago and was reinstated on foot of public outrage.  However, the criteria by which this scheme is administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs makes it almost impossible for many people to avail of it.  Unless such people are out of work and proven to be in receipt of one, two or three special allowances, they cannot avail of the back to school allowance.  Therefore, the very low-paid people who work every day cannot access this allowance if they wish to avail of back to education courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">There should be clarity between the Departments of Education and Science and Social and Family Affairs in this regard.  One or other Department should take up the issue and devise an allowance process that people can follow to gain access to third level education.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_270" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_778">In respect of the back to education initiative, between last year and this year, an additional 1,500 people are benefitting from it.  Consequently, I do not believe the Deputy is correct to state it is obviously too restrictive.  It is a highly valuable source of support for many people.  As for child care, the adult education child care service is available to those who participate in the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, and it was expanded last year.  It now caters for 1,700 student parents and their 2,300 children.  This is a highly flexible approach and it deals with everyone, adults, early school leavers, travellers and groups in general that have under-participated in the various levels of education.  I believe that between the different Departments, it is targeting all the different groups.  Given the investment of €392 million in all the aforementioned areas, as well as the inclusion of the two critical elements of child care and education guidance, real results will be seen from this initiative.</p>

        <b>Deputy Arthur Morgan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         her views on the fact that nearly half the State’s private fee-paying schools are claiming to be charities to avail of tax exemptions; if she will withdraw State funding for these schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [6768/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_271" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_780">The issue of tax exemptions is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  However, I understand that those primary and post-primary schools that have been granted charitable tax exemption by the Revenue Commissioners under section 207 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 were granted the exemption on the basis of their charitable objects and purpose.  The matter of whether they are fee-charging schools was not a consideration.  Approximately 420 primary and post-primary schools have been granted charitable tax exemption.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">Since 2001, all primary and post-primary schools providing education based on a programme prescribed or approved by the Minister for Education and Science automatically qualify as approved bodies for the purposes of the donations scheme under section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  There are approximately 4,000 such schools in the State.  The schools do not have to be charities to qualify for the donations scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">Any consideration of the funding arrangements for fee-charging secondary schools should take account of the historical context that gave rise to the differentiation between these schools and non-fee-charging secondary schools.  This differentiation arises essentially from the arrangements put in place when free second level education was introduced and those arrangements took account specifically of the position of minority religions with dispersed membership through the creation of the block grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">As the Deputy may be aware, there are currently 56 fee-charging second level schools, of which 21 are Protestant, two interdenominational, one Jewish and the remainder Catholic.  Fee-charging schools, with the exception of the Protestant and Jewish fee-charging schools for which special arrangements apply, do not receive capitation or related supports.  I referred previously to the block grant by way of which Protestant fee-charging schools receive funding.  The block grant has its origins in the desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant and Jewish persuasions to attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos and it includes payments in respect of capitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">It would be inappropriate for the State to depart in any fundamental way from the original intent that allowed some schools to opt to remain outside the free scheme and continue to charge fees and therefore I do not propose to withdraw State funding from such schools.  This support has been a long-standing feature of our education system and one continued by successive Governments.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">However, as I have stated previously to the House, it is important to take stock at this point and in particular I am of the view that while continuing to give reasonable support to existing schools, there should be no further development of the sector and accordingly I do not intend to provide State funding for any new fee-paying schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">As with all public expenditure measures I will keep the funding arrangements for the schools concerned under review to ensure they remain consistent with their original policy basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_788">The denomination of such schools is of little interest to me.  However, these schools receive taxpayers' money on the double.  They are in receipt of the €80 million pot earmarked by the Department for private post-primary schools.  Would the Minister consider deducting from that contribution of taxpayers' money to them an amount equivalent to the money they receive under the tax exemption scheme?  I accept this is a matter for the Minister for Finance and it should be examined as part of the tax review.  However, such schools are receiving money on the double from taxpayers.  Would the Minister consider using the money thereby saved by the Department, for example, to reinstate the summer works scheme?  The Minister knows as well as I do about the considerable number of schools waiting for significant funds.  Stonetown school in my constituency is seeking funding for a roof, Louth village school is seeking a toilet replacement and Termonfeckin school has asbestos on the roof.  These schools and many others throughout the country are depending on the summer works scheme to have the works carried out.  Will the Minister consider allocating a sum of money equivalent to that which schools are receiving by way of the charitable status tax exemption?</p>

            <p eId="para_789">The original definition of "charitable purposes" dates from 1601 and 1634.  It was established in law as long ago as 1891 that giving money for the advancement of education is a legitimate pursuit.  Schools use the provision for a wide variety of reasons.  For example, Sion Hill school in Blackrock had a magnificent 100-year old concert hall in need of refurbishment.  It was not funded by the Department of Education and Science but, because of donations, it was able to proceed with the project and reopen last Saturday.  Taking donations allowed it to qualify for an additional tax relief, thus affording greater benefits.  This is a very topical example of a non-fee-paying school that was able to do very valuable work on a magnificent building and great asset by using the tax reliefs available.  Since the relief is available to all schools, it would have been very unfair to deduct the amount from which the school benefited.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_802">The report of a working group to examine potential problems caused by the weight of school bags, which was presented in July 1998, acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level.  One of the main recommendations of the report related to the need to heighten awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy school bags and, in this regard, my Department initiated an awareness-raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">A further circular was issued in 2005, again highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy school bags and outlining a range of measures that could be adopted at school level to alleviate the problem.  Ultimately, it is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its needs and that fit with how it organises teaching and learning.  The report of the working group makes various recommendations in this regard, such as optimum use of storage facilities, developing pupil organisation skills and timetabling.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">My Department is aware that positive action has been taken by many schools on these issues.  Actions taken consist of a range of measures, including the provision of lockers and, in the case of second level schools, the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, school textbooks are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level.  Decisions on which books to use in schools are taken at school level.  However, the report of the working group was disseminated by my Department to the Irish Educational Publishers Association and it was asked to include consideration of the weight of school texts in its deliberations and liaise with teachers on finding solutions to the issue.  The report highlighted that both teachers and pupils favoured the use of multi-level textbook production for convenience and ease of access and cited a high demand for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">A copy of the report of the working group on the weight of school bags and all current circulars on this issue are available on my Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_807">There have been memos, reports, circulars and recommendations but the problem still persists.  While coming to work this morning, I witnessed young children of no more than eight on their way to school with what can best be described as rucksacks.  One would think they were going on safari rather than to a primary school.  Is the Minister aware of the report by an American professor that states no child should be allowed to carry a school bag that weighs more than 10% of his or her own weight?  The report also states it is harmful to the skeletal development of a child to be carrying such burdens.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">The reports and circulars have not been effective.  Ministers and Governments come and go, yet the problem arises every year.  Will the Minister consider legislating to set out in black and white what is allowable?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_286" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_809">It is not feasible to legislate on the weight of school bags but I appreciate what the Deputy is saying.  The problem is even greater for first year students because, at 13 years of age, they decide to carry to school all the books for all their new subjects.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">Some of the problems that have arisen, which must be weighed against each other, concern the fact that certain junior certificate courses, such as history, are three-year courses.  Some of the textbooks are composite books that cover the three years and parents therefore prefer to buy them rather than three separate books because doing so is cheaper.  However, although they are cheaper, the child must carry more weight, bearing in mind that the problem can arise in respect of books for all subjects.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">Another difficulty arises because teachers like books that encompass all levels.  Where honours, ordinary and foundation level students are all in the one class, especially during first and second year, they must all work from the same textbook rather than three different ones.  This is a practical problem that must be addressed at school level.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">The provision of lockers is important and we provide funding for them as part of our furniture grant under the schools building programme.  This is one way of ensuring that students do not have to carry heavy textbooks to and from school every day.  Students will not pull a bag behind them because it does not look cool.  If they did so, it would alleviate the problem, but if one is 13 one does not want to do so.</p>

Will the Minister consider recommending that these multi-level textbooks, or large tomes as she described them, which include three years' work, be divided into at least year groups of work?  Will she consider issuing a ministerial order or directive to this effect, if she agrees the weight of heavy schoolbags containing heavy school books poses a danger to the health of children's backs?  Has she received any reports from physiotherapists, orthopaedic professionals, chiropractors or others regarding the danger imposed on children by having to carry heavy schoolbags to schools under the aegis of her Department?</p>

The Minister mentioned the provision of lockers in schools, but there are difficulties in terms of cost and space.  Will she initiate a system of grant assistance for schools that would like to avail of this solution?  Will the Minister consult publishers about the possibility of the publication of smaller-sized books?  Students do not need books the size of <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> for every subject; why can smaller textbooks not be published?  Furthermore, could more use be made of computers by students to view books electronically or could they not have two sets of books, one at school and one at home?  These constructive suggestions should be considered in view of the potential danger to children’s health posed by this problem.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_830">It is my view that it is important for children to avail of the opportunity to exercise at school and that children should be able to run and move freely in the school yard unless there are very compelling reasons for individual schools  to prohibit such activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 sets out the responsibilities on individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools.  It is also a matter for school authorities to determine school policies, taking into account any health and safety risks to children running in the school yard and to put appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate any potential risk to the school community.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">As part of the management of the risks, there is an onus on boards of management to ensure, as appropriate, that they have put in place comprehensive insurance cover for schools.  Boards are advised by my Department to ensure that all such insurances are effective and maintained as are necessary to safeguard the school, the board and the trustees against all public liability.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">A key element of the management of the risks is ensuring there is adequate supervision of pupils in school yards.  The Education Act assigns each board of management and principal teacher responsibility for the day-to-day management of schools.  School principals are obliged to organise supervision for the order and general behaviour of pupils during school hours.  In particular, they should organise and participate in the effective supervision of the pupils during breaks, lunch-breaks, assembly and dismissal.  While the Department does not issue specific guidelines on requirements for supervision of pupils of different ages, it acknowledges that the degree of supervision required of school authorities varies with the circumstances, including the age of pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">While appreciating that it is not always possible to eliminate all risks, it should nevertheless be possible to manage them in such a manner that pupils can run in school yards provided it is done in an orderly and supervised manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_835">Will the Minister outline, from her experience of the reporting of this issue by colleagues on all sides of the House, how widespread is this problem?  It was brought to my attention by a number of parents in recent months.  Will she agree at the very least that an audit should be undertaken to ascertain how widespread this issue has become?  This must be the most bizarre new practice in our schools that children are being prevented from running in a school yard because of fear of litigation.  It is a scandal.  If that fear exists or if cases have been taken, surely there is an onus on the Minister and her Department to introduce composite insurance cover for schools to ensure actions cannot be taken against individual schools.  Will the Minister arrange for an audit to be conducted in this regard?  Will she consider the production of guidelines in this respect?  Schools need to know that such a policy is not acceptable.  We are trying to tackle obesity among children and ensure that children can remain children for as long as possible and now this practice is creeping into the school system.  It is unacceptable.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_304" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_836">I am not aware that such a policy is widespread.  It was only one school that came to my attention in this regard.  There is no record in the Department of complaints from parents in this respect.  I do not believe such a policy is widespread.  Where it exists, it is based on fear rather than a genuine reality that children will pose a grave danger to themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">The adoption of a "no ball" policy in one school was reported recently where children were not allowed to play in the area because of the grass being out of bounds or some other reason, but that is different from children running around a school yard.  I see no reason for such a policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">There is a supervision package in place where teachers are able to supervise children before and after school and during break-time.  That supervision package in one year alone cost €54 million.  Therefore, the supervision aspect is covered.  All the schools have public liability insurance.  Therefore, the insurance aspect is covered.  The upgrading of play areas has been happening over a number of years, not only through our building fund but through CLÁR and RAPID.  Money has been allocated to even the smallest of country schools to enable them to upgrade the surfaces of playgrounds.  Last year alone 447 schools were provided with outdoor play areas.  Therefore, it is not as if the bad condition of the play area could be a cause of concern.  In terms of the play area and the supervision and insurance aspects, there is no reason for a "no running" policy to be in place.</p>

        <b>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</b>

        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         if her attention has been drawn to the fact that Integrate Ireland, the body to whom she has given responsibility for training English language support teachers, has had no seminars for some time and none is currently planned; the way she expects language support teachers to get the education and experience necessary when no training is available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_309" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_844">As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has dramatically increased the number of language support teachers from just over 250 in 2002 to nearly 2,000 this year.  We have also placed an emphasis on developing specific materials for teaching English as a second language.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">Integrate Ireland Language and Training has developed a number of key resources which have been distributed to all schools by the Department.  These include comprehensive packs of classroom materials for language support teachers and recently a tool kit for diversity in the primary schools was issued to all primary schools on the island of Ireland as this was a North-South project.  A language assessment kit for use in primary schools will be issued after Easter.  The post-primary version of this assessment kit is currently being developed by IILT and will be available later this year.  IILT has also delivered some seminars for teachers.  However, its primary function has been one of research and direct provision to programme refugees and other non-nationals with leave to remain in the State and its role in teacher training has always been a limited one.  Training for teachers in supporting students with English language needs is being provided in a number of ways.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">All student teachers are given an awareness of inter-cultural issues, including the challenges of teaching students whose first language is not English.  Language support teachers at primary level are qualified to teach English.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">The review of initial teacher education being undertaken by the Teaching Council will undoubtedly be informed by the need for all teachers to be able to respond to the increasingly diverse backgrounds of our students.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">Summer courses play a very significant role in meeting the professional development needs of primary teachers in particular.  This year Coláiste Mhuire Marino, in conjunction with the INTO, piloted a national on-line course on teaching English as an additional language.  More than 900 teachers participated in this course.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">An English Language Support Teachers Association has recently been established under the teacher professional network scheme for post-primary teachers, which is funded by my Department.  This network will assist post-primary language support teachers in the provision of peer professional development.  The inspectors in my Department will conduct an evaluation of the provision of English as an additional language in a number of schools in the next school year.  This will help identify needs and inform policy in this area for the future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
            <p eId="para_850">Can we just focus for a moment on primary English language support teachers?  My understanding is that seminars had been arranged for teachers in that category for some considerable time.  My colleague, Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh, tabled a question to the Minister in November 2007, at which point it was established that no seminars were scheduled.  No seminars for primary English language support teachers are scheduled at the moment, as far as I know.  Will the Minister confirm whether that is the case, that there were no seminars scheduled then, and that none has been scheduled since?  Is she concerned about that?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_311" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_851">I am not aware of seminars due to take place, but the fact is that all schools will be issued with a language resource kit, the materials for supporting teachers, the assessment kit for identifying children's needs — with a particular focus on the years they might need — after Easter.  This material will be going out to primary schools as well at the end of the year.  The fact that this initiative is also integrated within the whole teacher training area probably picks up the need.  However, the support teachers' professional development body, funded by the Department, also looks at peer development, which will also work towards filling the gap.</p>

          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_312">
            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_852">The lack of adequate resources for migrant children is fuelling segregation within schools.  It is forcing teachers to slow down the pace of their education in class to the detriment of Irish pupils.  Will the Minister put a specific capitation grant in place for migrants, especially the children of asylum applicant parents who cannot avail of extracurricular activities, for example?  Will she promote greater flexibility as regards funding for language training?  For example, some training could be provided during the summer months when migrant children are on holidays so that they are up to speed when they actually start school on 1 September.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">On the post-primary assessment kit, why is that not being expedited?  Is it not the case that the biggest challenge we face as regards language is at second level, yet this is the one that is being put on the long finger?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_313" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_854">It is not being put on the long finger.  That will be issued this year as well.  The primary one is ready first, because there are more children attending primary schools, and more teachers at primary level.  I do not accept what the Deputy says about children not being able to participate in extracurricular activities.  That is one sure way in which they will pick up the language, and they do.  The achievement of children, particularly at primary school, in picking up the language skills is noteworthy.  They are getting the opportunity and children under the age of 12 learn a second language quicker than older children.  It is very important to note that each of those teaching English as an additional language in our primary schools is qualified and trained to do so.  The language kit is also there for them, as is the assessment kit.  Resources have been put in place and, as I said, the second level kit will be going out at the end of the year.  When the inspectorate does its evaluation of the work that is going on, it will be useful to see what policy changes need to be implemented, because the ground is fast changing.  However, the fact we have 2,000 teachers, whose sole job is to teach English as an additional language is a great credit to the education system and teachers throughout the country.</p>

            <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
            <p eId="para_855">Will the Minister please confirm that her Department intends to hold no further seminars for primary English support teachers and that the seminar scheme, which was poor enough in its own right, will be replaced by the issuing of a language resource kit?  Will she accept that this is the cutback of all cutbacks?</p>
            <p eId="para_856">As regards her earlier reference to the INTO-Marino College course, my understanding is that 230 applicants applied for that in the autumn of last year and that teachers paid for it out of their own pockets.  Will the Minister accept that this is clear testimony to the need for additional training by teachers, which should not be paid for by them but by the State?</p>

            <p eId="para_857">Some 900 teachers participated in that course last summer.  It was part of the summer courses primary school teachers do.  They do a five-day course and get three days in lieu, time off, during the school year.  It was a particularly popular course, so the Deputy can see we are being flexible in all——</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_862">I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 113 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">In January of this year, I announced the bundling arrangements for the delivery of public private partnership, PPP, projects in nine separate third level institutions.  The first bundle includes library projects at Limerick Institute of Technology, the University of Limerick and Cork Institute of Technology and a digital media building, workshops and multi-purpose hall at Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art,  Design and Technology, DLIADT.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">The second bundle includes an engineering and science building, architecture building and business and enterprise extension at the Waterford Institute of Technology; and a catering and tourism building, multi-purpose centre and engineering building at the Institute of Technology in Tallaght.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">The third bundle includes a mathematical sciences and computer centre at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth; a teaching research wing, new administration and support centre at Carlow Institute of Technology; and an engineering school at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">Following my announcement, pre-procurement work consisting of the preparation of output specifications, the public service benchmark and applications for outline planning permission is ongoing in my Department for the first bundle of projects.  On completion of these key tasks, it is envisaged that this bundle will be offered to the market by the National Development Finance Agency, NTFA, by the third quarter this year.  In the meantime, work will continue on the second and third bundles.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">As we are still at the pre-procurement stage, all technical, legal and financial matters including the interest rate being charged, will not be finalised until the tender process has been completed.  Therefore, it is not possible to indicate the interest rate being charged by the successful bidders for the three bundles at this stage.  It is proposed that the concession period for the operation of all three bundles will be 25 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">All costs associated with the provision and maintenance of the buildings will be taken into account in the preparation of the public service benchmark, including the cost of repairs and maintenance for the duration of the contract.  The cost of repairs and maintenance for the concession period must be included by shortlisted bidders in the overall contract and cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">The buildings will remain in State ownership for the duration of the contract and the PPP company will be granted a licence to build the facilities and maintain and operate them for a period of 25 years.</p>

No doubt the Minister's officials will advise that if this is left to the NDFA I cannot ask questions from that body because it is outside the remit of parliamentary questions, in which case the Minister has no responsibility.  I am trying to establish whether it is cheaper to use the traditional capital programme of the State by borrowing or by raising extra capital, as distinct from paying through the public private partnership process.  The chartered accountant beside the Minister, Deputy Michael Ahern, will no doubt be able to elaborate in some detail as to whether we are going to be ripped off for projects for which there is no market risk whatsoever.</p>

            <p eId="para_883">It is also important to recognise that the value can only be assessed over a period of 25 years and the way in which the risks were transferred has to be considered.  These will be accelerated projects and might not have been delivered as quickly under our own capital programme.  Equally it must be considered that management is built into the project.  This must all be taken into account when looking at the figures.  We learned from the first bundle of schools and we took on board all the recommendations of the pilot project.  The interest rate charged on those projects was 6.196%.  The interest rate on the National Maritime Museum was 5.563% and 4.5% on the Cork School of Music.  When one takes into consideration the 25 years, the management of the projects being included and the state-of-the-art buildings, these have been very good value for money.</p>

            <p eId="para_889">I was wondering why the Leas-Cheann Comhairle wanted to get to the question.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">Waterford Institute of Technology is a very important institution making a great contribution to education generally and to the economic and social wellbeing of the region.  We are considering carefully its request and also that of the Dublin Institute of Technology, to be designated as a university.  This issue does not just affect Waterford or DIT, but will have a major impact on the future structure of the higher education system throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">The Government wants to build on our strengths and to provide an environment where all our higher education institutions can develop in a way that best serves the country as a whole and the regions where they are based.  These issues must be central to consideration of the appropriate next steps in respect of both applications which I am examining in conjunction with my Government colleagues.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">While Dr. Port's report is specifically on the Waterford application, it also provides a useful analysis of the context in which any application for designation as a university must be considered.

We have the highest rate of unemployment in the country, the lowest number of students attending third level courses and the lowest number of graduates returning to the region, the lowest level of disposable income and the lowest rate of gross valued-added product.  The Minister cannot ignore these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_899">The reason the report has been published today is because it was cleared by Government just yesterday.  Any consideration of a university for anywhere, be it the Dublin Institute of Technology or the Waterford Institute of Technology, must be based on very strict academic criteria, on the case made for the region, as the Deputy said and must be considered in the context of national education policy.  We are very well served by the existing dual system of the institutes of technology and of the universities which have served to develop our regions, to strengthen our economy and in particular, to support society.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">One of the issues highlighted in the Port report is that we do not have set criteria under section 9 of the Education Act and this needs to be re-examined.  The section states merely that it should be in keeping with sections 12 and 13 of the Act but it does not set out the criteria and the hoops that must be jumped.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">With regard to the third level participation rate, Waterford does not have the lowest rate in the country; it is below average but its participation rate has increased by 8%.  It is interesting to note that the highest rates of participation in the country are in counties which do not have a university.  The highest rates are in counties Kerry, Sligo, Leitrim.</p>

        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_359">
          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_928">I welcome the Bill.  There are two very significant elements to the Bill, the increase in the motor taxation regime and the new motor taxation system based on CO2 emissions.  It is rather unusual to hear any politician or public representative welcoming a Bill that increases taxes.  However, I believe there is a sound basis for welcoming the notion of an increase in taxation because the taxation involved will go back directly to the local authority.  As somebody who very much supports the work of local authorities, I believe that we as legislators should strive to reduce the notion of big government and the involvement of the national Government in local issues in so far as possible.  The best way to do so is to empower the local authorities and the executive locally, and put the decision making to some extent where it is required — back to the people elected to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">This Bill, through the increase in revenues which will ultimately accrue to the various local authorities, is positive and should find a level of welcome throughout the country.  There is no doubt that increasing taxes is always a problem.  However, when there is a requirement to finance the various different projects in local authority areas, it is better to do it in a direct way rather than taking the funding into the central Exchequer through increases in personal taxes.  I have always believed — I am sure everybody in the House would agree — that taking it into the central Exchequer always makes it more difficult to get that funding back to the local authorities in the regions.  That is the problem of big government and the centralisation of government.  If I recall it was you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who started that.  It was a very noble decision on your behalf at the time because it clearly underpins contributing money to the local authorities in a manner that is transparent and can be seen to best effect by the citizen.  Wherever possible, it is important to move away from centralising the taxation system and allow this to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">While the Minister is not in the House, I welcome the Minister of State who is representing him.  If the Minister had any doubts about the validity of this Bill, those would have been overcome by the nature of the arguments put forward by the Opposition.  The level of debate had descended into an argument over second-hand cars.  It is clear that in principle what the Minister is attempting to do with this legislation is positive and a step in the right direction.  From the contributions I heard from the other side, nobody seemed to address the big picture but focused on the minute detail of whether cars that were purchased by a particular date would hold their value for a period of time.  Somebody put forward the suggestion that sales representatives would be travelling around the country in order to increase mileage.  Most of us in this House travel a significant distance every week and we would minimise the level of travel if we could.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">It is worth noting the issue of local government funding.  The increase in taxation resulting from the Bill will have some impact in addressing the underfunding of local authorities.  The local government fund provided by the Department has an impact on local authorities.  However, unfortunately, many counties argue they do not get their fair share based on demographic changes that have taken place in recent years.  To get parochial for a moment, that certainly has been the case for many years in County Clare, which has not been able to remain in step with other counties when calculated on a <i>per capita</i> basis.  In line with the decisions he has taken here to increase taxation and provide further funding to local authorities, I urge the Minister to carry out a significant review of the local government fund as it applies to the various different local authorities in order to address the significant changes in the demographics in some counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">Some counties have fared better than others because they have not experienced the same level of influx of migration.  That has put particular strain on some local authorities to deliver the services now needed.  The latest census figures demonstrate that clearly and I am sure the next one will help to identify where that growth trend has continued.  If it is done on a <i>per capita</i> basis, it would inform the decision making in the Department as to how much should be transferred from central government to each of the local authorities to allow them to deliver the kind of services needed in a modern society.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">There will always be a debate on the balance between keeping taxes low to spur the economy on and assist in the kind of growth patterns we have seen for years, while at the same time having sufficient funds to allow the relevant authorities deliver the services they are charged with delivering.  The difficulty lies in finding the right balance.  The more that can be done through direct taxation focused specifically on the various different services, the better.  Obviously, the taxation collected here is targeted at the wider local authority service delivery but more particularly at assisting local authorities in providing their portion of funding towards the construction, maintenance and development of secondary, local and regional roads within the competency of the various local authorities.  The Department needs to consider that for various other services, including water pricing policy and the polluter pays principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">The burden on local authorities for the provision of services has increased significantly over the years.  The population shift is there for all to see, particularly as identified in the census.  It is continuing in line with the growth of economic centres away from the east coast — it is right throughout the west.  It is partly in line with the national development plan and the spatial strategy beginning to work in a coherent fashion.  There is a necessity from that point of view to ensure the kind of resources required are provided.  While the residential development levy provides funds to deal with some of the more localised issues, that should not be confused with the real burden on local authorities in areas such as the development of water and sewerage services.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">The past five or six years have seen a virtual stagnation in the number of new sewage treatment systems being developed in rural villages purely because of the introduction of the water pricing policy that required each local authority to come up with a very significant portion of the cost on the basis that the polluter would ultimately pay from within the commercial sector.  Unfortunately, that puts a burden on local authorities to amortise over a period of time those costs for which they cannot get payment immediately.  That creates a burden in terms of their capacity to deal with the associated debt.  The Department needs to review that in terms of the delivery of roads also.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">There has been considerable debate about sewerage and the water pricing policy and its effects in that regard.  We need to consider how that can be assisted in terms of the delivery of new road links required by virtue of new housing developments, etc.  These changes need to be taken into account when deciding on the local government fund in future.  Local government funding and motor taxation are utilised by many local authorities in a multiplicity of ways.  The priority is to deliver on key services, including local and regional roads.  Councils have an obligation to fund their part of that expenditure from the local government fund and motor taxation.  It is critical that they do so because as communities grow, new residential developments occur, the economic model in various counties changes and new enterprises start up, there is a requirement to develop new road links.  There is also a requirement to develop new secondary, local and regional roads as a result of the new motorway developments and bypasses around various towns.  Therefore, there is a significant need to upgrade our road network and we should be mindful of that aspect.  Anything that helps directly to continue local authority funding is positive and for that reason I welcome the increase in taxation from which positive benefits can accrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">We must also improve expenditure on local and regional roads.  Earlier today, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport received a good briefing from Mr. Noel Brett of the Road Safety Authority and the Garda Commissioner concerning their current strategy to reduce road deaths.  There is no doubt that spending on local and regional roads has a positive knock-on effect on reducing road deaths.  It is, therefore, incumbent on us and the local authorities to improve road safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">There is a health and safety requirement concerning road work sites.  Nationally, we have paid scant regard to the treatment of construction sites on secondary, regional and local roads.  Considerable efforts are made in this regard on some national routes, but construction work on minor routes is less than perfect.  In other countries, particularly the United States, high visibility signage is used to mark the most minor works on local and regional roads.  Police cars must be stationed at the site of all road works in the state of Massachusetts, for example, although I am not suggesting that we should go that far.  Nonetheless, we must approach the road safety issue realistically.</p>

          <p eId="para_947">This is part of how we propose to continue, sharing ideas on the understanding that we do not have all the answers ourselves.  We are happy to co-operate with everybody to try to bring about a solution that best fits the needs of this society.  Reducing road accidents is very much a part of that approach by two Departments working together, although with separate responsibilities.  Some 96% of our roads are secondary routes.  According to the statistics, 2.5% of all accidents result from the structure, state or quality of the road concerned.  We should examine that matter in the context of this debate.  There has been a significant increase in such road accidents.  In 1996, the figure was 1.5%, but it jumped to 2.5% in 2007.  We need to address that important 1% increase, which is worrying and requires urgent attention.  I hope the necessary funding will come from the Department to be better used by local authorities to target specific accident sites on the road network.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">There has been a strong focus on spending for national primary roads, which is welcome, but the bulk of that expenditure has gone into the 4% of the network that comprises inter-urban routes.  While such expenditure is essential, it is unfortunate that more of that funding was not spent in previous years.  In addition to the positive impact it has had on our capacity to continue with balanced regional development and the roll-out of economic infrastructure across the west, it has been helpful in continuing to attract foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">As the Acting Chairman, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will be aware, in our own region significant foreign direct investment has been provided in recent weeks by the Zimmer company.  That is a strong indication that our infrastructural development, including the improved road network, is beneficial in attracting such blue-chip companies that continue providing local employment throughout the mid-west and the west generally.  Investment in national routes has helped us to compete internationally in attracting that level of foreign direct investment.  We must support rural communities by funding the development of non-national roads so the increases provided for in the Bill will be extremely helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">It would be wrong not to acknowledge that while a lot of money has gone into national primary and inter-urban roads, there has been a lack of funding for national secondary roads.  While this may be somewhat parochial, in County Clare the N85, N67 and N68, which form part of the national secondary route network, are in need of urgent funding.  Revenue has been committed for the next two years for inter-urban routes, but I urge the Minister to consider changing that funding structure when the inter-urban routes have been completed.  It could then be put into some of the national secondary routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The Ennis to Kilrush road in particular needs a complete upgrade as do the roads running along the western seaboard of County Clare, and the Ennis to north Clare route.  Those three significant stretches of national secondary routes require urgent attention and the requisite funding.  We should examine that matter in the context of completing the national primary inter-urban routes.  We should try to put the same level of currently committed funding into these routes as we move towards 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">It may be a job for the National Roads Authority on direction from the Department, but the authority should examine road quality.  I often wonder if it is necessary to build some regional roads to the standard to which they are currently constructed.  To some extent, we have seen a change in some of the fundamentals of road building that has allowed us to deliver quality roads more cheaply without acquiring the same amount of land or building the same level of foundation.  We should examine that matter in the context of regional and local roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">The CO2 emission-based motor tax system is welcome and reflects the shared approach by our party and the Minister's party to protecting the environment.  We are delighted that it changes attitudes and puts in place a fundamental shift in our thinking.  In addition, it moves away from the notion of using gas-guzzling cars for vanity alone.  Such gas-guzzling vehicles must be consigned to the ranks of the vintage car class.  The Bill's provisions in this regard demonstrate enlightened thinking on transport for a purpose rather than for show.  We must instil such thinking in the minds of people who continue to drive cars that are effectively damaging the environment.  While these types of provisions may appear to target the consumer, the reality is that they will target the manufacturers and will test the minds of the engineers who developed the four-stroke engine over many years.  I have no doubt that within two to three years, we will have more powerful cars that conform to the emissions levels required under this legislation.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_956">This Bill is a legislative measure to give credence to the futile flutterings of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in regard to the provision of a new motor tax system based on CO2 emissions for new and pre-owned imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008.  A motor tax to reduce CO2 emissions may achieve an increase in revenue to the Exchequer but will have little or nothing to do with engine efficiency or the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">If the Green Party wants to appear green, that is, environmentally friendly, it will not accomplish it with this Bill.  Engine efficiency is about using the smallest amount of fuel over a set distance.  The motor tax, however, is a flat rate that takes no account of the amount of fuel used or the emissions produced over a particular distance.  It will do little to help our environment.  Pretending that the size of the engine is the sole factor in greenhouse gas emissions is to use the other meaning of the word "green", which is "naive".  It would be far more logical to tax fuel on the basis that the more efficient one's car, the less fuel one uses, leading to the desired environmental impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">Registering or owning a car does not cause emissions; driving it does.  If the Minister is serious about reducing CO2 emissions to meet our Kyoto targets and protect our environment, he should consider scrapping VRT and motor tax and replacing them with an additional tax on petrol and diesel.  Ten years of bad planning, urban sprawl and public transport chaos in this city and in many rural towns will not be undone by the measures in this Bill.  Taxpayers will continue to pay more than €60 million in carbon credits.  The Government should be ashamed that we are in the position of having to purchase these credits.  Another limitation of the Bill is the provision that the tax will be payable at the time of acquisition or of first putting into service of a passenger car.  As registration is a once-off tax, this may not be the most effective means of controlling CO2 emissions as future usage will not be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">We cannot simply point an accusing finger at consumers.   A survey conducted by National Irish Bank reveals that consumers are getting ready to embrace the move towards energy efficiency, such as the use of diesel engine vehicles.  According to the survey, 72% said that following the introduction of the new regulations, they would, or would be likely to, buy a diesel rather than a petrol car to decrease their CO2 emissions.  This is indicative of the level of commitment among citizens to meeting our Kyoto targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">Despite this, who will carry the can for the Government's panic move to avoid EU sanction?  Yet again, taxpayers are being asked to make up the shortfall.  The proposed increase in motor tax is nothing more than a stealth tax to the tune of €83 million.   The Minister's assertion that there will be no increase is a false promise.  There will undoubtedly be an increase.  We should not put all the blame on the withering Greens, however, but should give equal billing to their colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who sold the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government down the river in his Estimates for 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">In one of the most negative assessments of our economy since 1999, the European Commission reports that Ireland's fiscal position is expected to register a noticeable deterioration in 2007-08.  The Commission's economists describe the Government's projections of a decrease in real economic growth from 4.8% in 2007 to an annual average of 3.5% until 2010 as "plausible".  In other words, like we in opposition, they are taking the Minister's economic forecast with a grain of salt.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">Another attempt by the Minister to impose a penalty on fuel consumption was to give a sudden and ill-conceived blow to passenger transport services by removing the excise duty on fuel used by this sector.  Such a plan would sound the death knell for private coach operators and deliver an appalling blow to rural communities that do not have access to regular public transport services.  In an outrageous plan, €29 million of tax relief was taken from public and private bus operators to comply with an EU directive, but those affected were kept in the dark until the last moment by the Minister.  The bus operator in question only accidentally discovered that the rebate was to be removed.  So much for transparency and openness.  How green is green?  What way is this to conduct the running of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_963">Instead of trying to take away people's livelihoods and adding to the already dismal rural transport situation, it would serve the Government better to tackle CO2 emissions by providing an efficient and joined up public transport system to discourage car dependency.  Given that we do not even have a viable transport infrastructure in our capital city, it is not surprising that transport continues to be the dominant growth sector, with emissions 682,000 higher in 2006 than in 2005.  This represents a 5.2% increase on 2005 levels and a 165% increase since 1990.  The EU has informally pointed to the rapidly rising emissions from our transport sector as the cause of our very high carbon footprint relative to our population and geographical size.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">If the Minister were committed to the environment he would advocate alternative, cleaner modes of public transport.  The bottom line is that the Government has failed to facilitate people in switching from private cars to public transport.  There is no public transport system worth talking about in this State and that is firmly the fault of the Government.  There is nothing in the programme for Government about reintroducing rail freight as a method of tackling CO2 emissions, despite the fact that fuel consumption by road freight increased by 255%, or 9% per annum, from 1990 to 2006.  Such statistics go a long way to making a joke of the Minister's promise to cut national emissions by 3% per year in the lifetime of the Government.  He had better get a move on because he does not have much time.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">Not only is the way the Minister is administering the new CO2-based car tax regime weak on environmental impact, it will also potentially destabilise the second-hand car market.  Potential buyers will quickly realise that if they travel north of the Border or to Britain to purchase a second-hand car and then re-register it here, they will be eligible for the new CO2 tax system and thus save a significant amount of money in tax as compared with the purchaser of a similar vehicle in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">Once again the Government has failed to follow through on an issue and to show evidence of joined up thinking.  In supposedly solving one problem, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is creating several others.  Moreover, he is not even solving the problem at hand, which is Ireland's CO2 emissions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_372">
          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_967">I want to highlight three issues during my brief contribution to this debate.  I will start by explaining why the Bill before the House represents hypocrisy at its worst.  There will be a referendum on the Lisbon treaty soon.  We will tell the people of this country that the European Union has been great for Ireland.  We were told during previous EEC and EU referendums that people would be given the right to free movement within the EU.  I thought this legislation would allow people to import cars from other EU member states.  If the Government wants people to vote in favour of the Single Market, why does it not allow Irish citizens to cross the Border, within their own country, to buy cars and bring them back to this jurisdiction?  Why are people not allowed to bring cars back from England or Germany without being taxed by our Government?  If we do not allow people to act in such a manner, we are not providing for free movement or a Single Market.  The market is being hindered by the taxes being imposed by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">I will return to the Single Market in a moment.  The most important point I want to make relates to people who bought environmentally friendly cars with low CO2 emissions in January 2008.  I want to explain this point to those Fianna Fáil backbenchers who will speak out of both sides of their mouths during this debate — they will tell us what is wrong before voting tonight with the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and the Green Party.  They will turn yellow when faced with the Greens.  I will outline the problem.  I want the departmental officials who are present to listen to what I have to say.  This is wrong.  When the Revenue Commissioners find something wrong, they address it by following people and making sure they get the taxes for the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">I refer to people who have recently bought emission-friendly cars and taxed them for the year.  When they tax the same car next year, they will not get any benefits from the legislation before the House.  They will be taxed the same way in 2009 as they are being taxed in 2008.  There will be a knock-on effect when they try to trade the car in at a garage.  The owner of the garage will say he has to take €5,000 off the value of the car because the Minister created an anomaly in this legislation.  If the garage sells the car to Joe Soap, he will have to pay tax on it at the higher rate.  In a few years' time, garages will have hundreds of new and second-hand cars to which the lower tax rate will have applied from July 2008.  That anomaly needs to be corrected.  It is very simple.  It is wrong.  If it is wrong, it should be corrected in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">The Government is great at taking tax off people, but it needs to be just as efficient in correcting the anomaly I have highlighted.  As Deputy Bannon said, people will cross the Border to buy second-hand cars.  It is very simple.  After July of this year, the lower tax rate will apply in this jurisdiction to cars with low emissions which were taxed in Northern Ireland prior to July 2008 before being brought to the South.  It is daft.  A person who lived within the law by buying an environmentally friendly car will pay the higher rate of tax on that car from next year.  This anomaly is caused by an error in the legislation.  The Government should ensure that people do not have to go to court to sort this problem out.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">The faults in this legislation can be sorted out on Committee Stage if the Government introduces the necessary amendments.  It is very simple.  If it is wrong today and tomorrow, it will be wrong next week if it is not corrected.  Fianna Fáil backbenchers should not tell us what the problem is — we know what the problem is.  They should make that point to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, who represents Fianna Fáil's partners in Government.  The Green Party is the partner Fianna Fáil never wanted.  I am sure Deputy Fleming remembers when Fianna Fáil used to issue statements claiming that the Green Party would be bad for the economy and bad for rural Ireland.  The Greens were not bad when Fianna Fáil was looking for a coalition partner, however.  They were okay then.  Everything was fine then.  The Minister should correct this aspect of the legislation because it is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">The final point I wish to make relates to road safety.  Perhaps the Minister, the Government and the officials in the Department can address it.  We are familiar with the proposal to establish a fund to raise money for local authorities.  Local authorities have no money.  The increase in the funds they have been given this year will be cancelled out by inflation and wage increases.  There will be no money left for expenditure on roads.  Can the Minister, Deputy Gormley, explain what we have got against putting up signage in this country?  I can give Deputy Fleming an example that relates to his constituency.  I accept that great work is being done as part of the road works at Athlone, which will bring people to Dublin more quickly.  Many people from County Mayo are confused by the sign at Athlone telling people how to get to Tullamore.  I do not know why a sign for Dublin was not put up at the same time.  Some poor devil had to get out of his car and take out his paint brush to put the word "Dublin" on a sign.  Many people who wanted to go to Dublin were ending up on the road to Tullamore.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">Similarly, many people from Mayo and other parts of the country have contacted me to complain about the signs they encounter when they get onto the section of the M50 currently affected by road works.  It is a very simple thing.  What is wrong with putting up a few signs?  I do not see the point of the signs which say "The South" and nothing else.  I thought we were in the South.  When people get onto the narrow section of road that is under repair, they see signs saying "The South".  There are no signs — just arrows — telling them where else they can go.  Many people end up having to pay to go over the toll bridge before they get a chance to drive towards the city centre.  The Government is great at taking tax revenue from people, but it does not seem to take any responsibility for road safety or road conditions.  I do not know why proper signage cannot be erected in Dublin and every other city, town and village in the country.  What is wrong?  Do we not want people to know what we have in this country?  Do we not want them to know where they are going?  Is it not very simple to put up a sign?  What is wrong in this country that we cannot put up signage?</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_988">It is a very simple thing.  As I have said, my final point relates to road safety.  A new section of the N5 in County Mayo, as far as Ballaghaderreen, was recently opened.  I ask RTE to send a journalist to the area to see what has been done.  I do not know why a white structure had to be put on the new road.  I do not have the correct term for what the thing is actually called.  I suppose a massive amount of money was spent on the road.  Bollards have had to be erected because accidents were happening on the road, which is a national primary route.  People who were driving along the road suddenly found that they had gone over the structure to which I refer.  There was an accident or two.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">I do not know where the NRA got the engineers who designed the road.  I do not know why this structure was put up.  I do not know what benefit it is supposed to have.  I will take a photograph of the structure the next time I travel on the road on a bright evening.  I will send the photograph to the Minister and the NRA.  Perhaps one of the daily newspapers will run a quiz asking its readers to guess what purpose the structure serves, or why it was deemed necessary.  The only thing it does is endanger the lives of people in cars.  Someone will be killed at that spot.  I have drafted a letter on the matter, which I intend to send to Mayo County Council, the NRA and the Minister.  They will have to take responsibility if someone is killed at that location.  They have created a problem that did not need to be created.  They create problems when they build new roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">I am concerned about the role of local authorities in the area of health and safety.  People have told me about the problems which arise when diversions are needed during road works or in the aftermath of an accident.  I have seen these "diversion" signs.  Drivers are often diverted all over the country because there are no signs to bring them back to their original route.  For all the local authorities care, one could end up in Louisburgh or Ballymena in Northern Ireland.  I do not know why they do not put up signs telling drivers where they have to go.  That would be too much trouble.  It is a health and safety issue and it would be good for them to get involved in that to save people the hassle.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">The legislation is about raising revenue for the Government, it is not about being green, yellow or blue.  It is another stealth tax.</p>

The Government does not mind subsidising Dublin but we need our cars and the Government is taxing us to make sure we will have no cars.  It is all right for the Minister, he can cycle to work in the morning, cycle home for his lunch and dinner and cycle home at night.  I cannot cycle from Dublin to Westport.  If I could, I would, but I need my car because we do not have proper public transport in the west.</p>

In the first week of December 2006, my constituency colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced in the House that he would examine motor taxation, carbon taxes and carbon emissions.  During 2007 substantial consultations took place and progress was made in this regard.  Changes were announced in the budget, which are being provided for in legislation before the House this week and next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">There are two aspects to the changes being introduced as part of the overall move to tax carbon emissions.  The changes in VRT, which one pays when one purchases a car, are being dealt with on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, which is before the select committee now.  This legislation deals with annual motor tax.  Two parallel Bills are going through the House as part of the root and branch approach to carbon emissions and the introduction of a carbon tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">People give out about changes in tax regimes, but governments have always used taxation as a major method of influencing change in society.  There is more to taxation than increasing VAT or other taxes by a few cent.  In years to come, legislation will be introduced as this form of taxation evolves and this Bill is the first major step.  I refer to tax reliefs and changes in the taxation system that have led to changes in society as we embark on a new road with a new tax, which will have a major impact when people look back in 2050.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Mortgage interest relief is a strong feature of the tax code and it has resulted in Ireland having one of the highest home ownership rates in the world.  Export sales relief and the Shannon free zone were tax incentives introduced to encourage companies to export from particular locations.  Urban renewal schemes have been of great benefit to help breathe new life into many towns and cities.  The Irish Financial Services Centre is in place because of changes to the tax regime.  Many hotels have been built throughout the State as a result of the tax relief on hotels.  When I entered Leinster House first, we had two hotels in County Laois but now we have seven or eight.  They were developed and opened and they have been fully functioning for the past five years because of changes to the tax regime.</p>

          <p eId="para_1011">More people are willing to work and they can keep their own money.  People are more concerned with doing their week's work and they are happy to pay 20% rather than 60%.  Changes in taxation influence the way society functions and this legislation is another example.  The new motor vehicle tax will be based on carbon emissions per kilometre. I hope somebody will explain what that means.  What kilometre are we talking about?  Are we talking about a kilometre on a bench in a factory where the car is made in Germany or Japan?  Are we talking about a kilometre on a standard Irish road?  Is it a kilometre uphill or downhill or on the level?  Is the wind at one's back or in one's face?  These factors might seem trivial but the basis on which the tax on carbon emissions is introduced in legislation must be fair and transparent and comprehensible to ordinary people.  Carbon emissions per kilometre seems a simple concept but I would like it explained and fleshed out so that ordinary people can understand what we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">I accept there are anomalies in the legislation but it is the first step in this area.  I am satisfied a number of the anomalies will be eliminated during the passage of the Bill.  However, legislation in this area will be introduced annually and when people see how it operates over 12 months, we will have practical experience under our belt this time next year, and if changes need to be made, they can be introduced.  I agree a man or woman who buys a car on 30 June will not only pay VRT at time of purchase, he or she will also be caught for the higher annual motor tax rate for the rest of the car's life, unlike the person who purchases a car on 1 July.  It will inevitably result in a collapse in car sales in many categories between April and June but maybe the industry will gear up for that challenge.  The reason 1 July is set out in the legislation is because the Society of the Irish Motor Industry asked for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1020">I am not in the business of making deals like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">I do not like the fact that the legislation seems to give an inordinate advantage to imported cars.  One can import a two year old car from Northern Ireland and register it in Ireland after 1 July.  That might give a significant incentive to import second-hand cars.  I do not know why that provision was made because it could cause serious problems for the motor trade.  If that hole is to be plugged, it should be done as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">The annual duty on cars will start at €100 for vehicles first registered on or after 1 July 2008 for which CO2 emissions do not exceed 120 g/km.  Under the existing arrangement, any vehicle not exceeding 1,000 cu. cm. has a tax bill of €165.  Even for the smallest car, there is already a reduction.  Cars at the top of the range which exceed 225 g/km will be taxed at the rate of €2,000.  That compares to the current regime whereby 3 litre cars are taxed at €1,491.  There will be severe annual penalties for people who buy cars falling within that range.  The Schedule to the Bill provides for an annual tax of €2,000 for cars that:</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">(I) cannot be confirmed by the Revenue Commissioners by reference to the relevant EC type-approval certificate or EC certificate of conformity, and</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">(II)  the Revenue Commissioners are not satisfied of by reference to any other document produced in support of the declaration for registration pursuant to that section 131.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">I think that means if people import cars for which satisfactory documentation cannot be provided to the Revenue Commissioners, they will be charged €2,000 per annum.  That will help to curtail a large volume of imports.  If I am wrong, I hope the Minister will correct me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">This income will be used to fund local government.  This year more than €1 billion will be raised through motor tax.  The parties opposite advocated the abolition of this tax and its replacement with an increase in the price of petrol and diesel but that would push the price of fuel up to €10 per gallon.  People would be horrified if they listened to the comments made in that regard by Fine Gael Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">Road transport accounts for approximately 20% of emissions across Europe, with private cars comprising 12% of that figure.  It is important, therefore, that we proceed on this issue.  The proposals were announced in budget 2006 and implemented in budget 2007.  I am sure the legislation will be further refined in coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">The Minister stated that requirements pertaining to the display of information on car fuel economy and CO2 emissions were introduced in 2001 on foot of an EU directive.  All passenger cars offered for sale or lease in Ireland must be accompanied by a fuel economy label and display information on the vehicle's fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.  That is news to me.  I bought a couple of cars during that period but that information was never brought to my attention.  The regulations also require the publication of a guide for consumers on fuel economy and CO2 of all makes and models of new passenger cars for sale in Ireland and that similar information be included in promotional material and advertising.  The only information on cars of which I am aware is whether they can accelerate from 0 km/h to 60 km/h in three seconds.  I am more interested in the car that can go from 60 km/h to 0 km/h in less than three seconds.</p>

I am pleased that the Minister is proposing to change the requirements on the display of new labels with effect from 1 July 2008 to coincide with the introduction of the CO2-based motor tax and vehicle registration system.  It is his intention that the new label will include consumer friendly information on vehicle CO2 emissions based on the seven CO2 bands set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  The label will be similar to energy rating labels that already exist for many consumer electrical goods.  We are familiar with such goods — washing machines, refrigerators, cookers and toasters — because we have them in our homes.  The new label will also include information on fuel efficiency, the amount of motor tax payable and the applicable rate of the vehicle registration tax.  The Minister is proposing to introduce separate legislation to give effect to these proposals and I am pleased that is the case.  This was part of an EU directive that has never been implemented in Ireland.  Following its introduction, people will know the practical effect of what is involved when they go to their local garage.</p>

I was surprised by the size of grant he allocated in respect of road signage in my constituency.  Individual councils are responsible for the activities of their engineers.  One could visit every town throughout the country and find stupid signs that were erected by engineers who are also possibly stupid.  Due to the fact that these people know where they are going, they are of the view that everyone else does too.  Signs are erected by people who know the roads, but they should be put in place by those who are not familiar with the roads.</p>

          <p eId="para_1059">Yes.  There are a number of issues I wish to highlight in the context of our emissions targets under the Kyoto Agreement.  We have a responsibility to our European neighbours in respect of this matter and to future generations in Ireland and throughout the world that will be obliged to live in more difficult conditions.  We must do what is good for the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">We are dealing with this matter in the wrong way.  We are tinkering around with taxation but we have failed to examine the cause of emissions.  I refer to the transport system.  The way railways here have been neglected is nothing short of a disgrace.  We do not encourage people to transport goods by rail.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, will be familiar with the mines in County Tipperary which transport what they produce to Cork by road.  When planning permission was granted in respect of these mines and others throughout the country, those developing them should have been asked to transport what they produce by rail.  There is a great railway line from Dublin to Cork.  Many railway lines throughout the country have either been closed down or are not as busy as should be the case.  There is major room for improvement in rail infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">It is time the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Transport and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government came together and adopted a position on transport, particularly heavy goods vehicles.  Any number of trucks use our roads 24 hours a day and pump emissions into the atmosphere.  The goods these vehicles carry could be moved much more efficiently by rail.  We do not take this matter seriously.  If we are to be successful in the area of reducing emissions, the Departments to which I refer must come together and draw up a plan to make our transport system more efficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">Deputy Fleming referred to noise emissions from motor cars.  I cannot but agree wholeheartedly with what he said in that regard.  No matter where one goes, one will come across small cars that make enough noise to blow one's ears off.  The position relating to such cars must be regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">Many people throughout the country are obliged to travel to work but they would not have to do so if they had access to broadband.  This would reduce the number of cars on the road.  However, the roll-out of broadband has been extremely slow and many towns and villages do not have access to it.  That is unfair.</p>

It seems we were right because that is how matters have begun to unfold.  However, now the poor Green Party is caught in that embrace.  Not only are the members of the Green Party enjoying snuggling and licking up to Fianna Fáil, they do not realise that, even as they do so, the life is being sucked out of them.  Slowly but surely they are being strangled.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_1069">It is relevant.  It is important that organisations such as the Green Party are allowed to remain in existence.  This is an environmental issue, a motoring issue and a taxation issue and it is entirely relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">To get to the kernel of the issue, the Minister referred earlier to increases.  We should remember they could not deal with the environment or the emissions, as was proposed by Fine Gael and Labour in Opposition before the election, by suggesting there be a precise reduction everybody could identify with regarding emissions.  The increases are 9.5% for cars below 2.5 litre engine capacity and 11% for cars above that level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">There is a penalty for the cars above the specified engine capacity, with which I do not have a problem.  There is also an increase for those below.  The stick and the carrot are wrapped up together in one heavy bludgeoning instrument that will be unleashed on the heads of the poor unfortunate population.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">There has been much talk about transport in this country recently and I will deal with two specific subjects.  We must be realistic on an economic basis when evaluating our position.  The transport system in the country was and still is totally outdated.  We were never geared up for modern transport and never moved along with investment in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s or 1990s.  We have not done so since the foundation of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">While people speak about the degree to which the problem has arisen in the past ten years, the fact is the problem was not there beforehand because we exported our population for the previous 50 years.  The perspective is completely different from that of other European countries.  The experts should be careful they do not wrong-foot themselves economically and cause serious problems for the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">I have other points.  The selling point on this issue was that the money was going to local authorities.  Everybody thought this was wonderful and the Government backbenchers jumped up and down and clapped their hands, cheering.  It is untrue, however, as the amount of money available to local authorities has decreased on another level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">My colleague, the Minister of State from Kildare South, Deputy Seán Power, will have travelled over the potholed roads of north and south Kildare, in urban and particularly rural areas.  All the people there can do is replace the suspension on their cars at least every six or seven months because the roads are in such an appalling condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">I blame the Government backbenchers for this, just for want of blaming somebody.  Somebody must be blamed in this case and they must stand up.  I hear the Fianna Fáil backbenchers have been at least standing up on the pharmacy issue in the past couple of days.  Now is the time for the Government backbenchers to stand up and brace the Government on this issue, if they have a conscience in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">I remind the Government that we should not be told of the great things which will happen to the roads in the country as the amount of money going to them has been reduced.  The proof of this is that all local authorities in the country dramatically increased the rents of local authority houses in the past number of weeks.  There were 100% increases in some cases.  Development levies have also gone up.  There have been all sorts of increases, as cheques can be written in order to extract more money from the unfortunate consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">We have seen and heard much criticism of the motorist in recent times, as if he or she was a potential criminal who should be put off the road at the earliest opportunity.  They are said to be doing incredible damage.  Deputy Ring and others have referred to the people who actually damage the roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">I remind the Minister and the Government front, back and middle benches that the unfortunate motorist contributes more than €5 billion per annum to the Exchequer.  For that, he or she will get clamped if they park in the wrong place or if they cannot find a place to park.  If they drive to a railway station and cannot find a place to park there, they get clamped again.  A congestion charge is now being considered for when they drive into towns in certain parts of the country.  That is a financial clamp.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">Very little credit is given to the fact that a very sizable commitment is made to the Exchequer by the motorist of all shades, opinion and size.  Very little recognition is given by the Government but the motorist is paying through the nose for the provision of services that do not come about.  It is extraordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">It is my sad realisation that my time is nearly concluded although I have many issues on which to speak.  I agree entirely with the concept of engines designed for lower emissions.  They will be very beneficial.  Technology has advanced greatly and can advance much more, creating improvements that we have not even examined yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">Long may the happy loving family of the Greens, Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats and the Independent Government backbench supporters continue to walk, drive and cycle in the various modes of transport available to them.  I plead that they use vehicles with lower emissions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelWDArcy" eId="spk_445">
          <from>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</from>
          <p eId="para_1083">I will try not to be as funny as my two colleagues about the Greens.  It is amazing to see what I term the "Al Gorification" of Fianna Fáil by the Green Party.  It is difficult to know who is the greenest, the republican green or the environmental green of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">When I came into the Chamber, Deputy Fleming was castigating Fine Gael's position on taxation, a point I will touch on briefly.  Fine Gael brought down the corporation tax rate.  There was no more positive action taken to drive this economy forward than the lowering of corporation tax.  Lower corporation tax allows companies to come in, manufacture goods and sell them on, bringing in new money.  The Government will have to wrestle with this in future because not alone are we now losing jobs to Third World countries, but we are losing them to north Wales and places of that nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">The new CO2 taxation mechanisms for road taxation is another way to charge more in tax.  It will bring in an extra €83 million in 2008, but I am sure the numbers will not stop there for 2009, 2010 and onwards.  There are anomalies, with the main example being the collapse in the price of a second-hand car after the July date, which will have a catastrophic effect on those buying second-hand cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">It is likely those cars will be bought by people less capable of buying new cars with lower emissions.  Although the car will be cheaper to buy, they will end up paying more tax year on year.  This will become a tax on poorer people.  I do not know if the Government has taken this concern into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">Another issue is the idea that motorists are bad people.  The reality is the motorist has no genuine alternative to get around the State in terms of public transport.  Outside a few rail lines, the train system is practically non-existent.  The best example is the train service from the town I live in, Gorey, to Dublin.  The distance is 50 miles but the service takes two and a quarter hours.  Seán Kelly in his prime would have got there faster on his racing bike.  It is a crazy position and there is no investment in a second line, passing bays or rail signal systems evident across the Continent and the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">Deputy Durkan and the Minister spoke about money, with some €992 million going back to the local authorities.  County Wexford collected €25 million last year in motor taxation.  In 1999, that figure was in the region of £8 million.  Factoring in the exchange from punts to euro, we have doubled the amount of money being collected.  It is another example of stealth taxes being brought in by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">One would not mind the money being raised if it went back to the people in some form.  I have another example from County Wexford, which has 1,700 miles of bluetop surface roads.  We received in the region of €16.9 million in 2007 in moneys back from the Department from the €25 million collected.  Counties with fewer miles of county road than Wexford, in some cases between 25% and 30% fewer, receive the same amount.  I would like to see an open transparent system which tells us how much each county receives per mile of blue top county road.  Wexford must make the money stretch.  The objective used to be that the local authority received money back for every 15 miles but that has been stretched to 20 and in some cases 22 and 23 miles.  We need to know how much each county receives per linear mile of county road.  When Deputy Roche was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government County Wicklow received more money in 2007 than Wexford yet it has 20% fewer county roads.</p>

          <p eId="para_1094">The Green Party and the Government have not been proactive in supporting a burgeoning industry in bio-fuels.  This needs to be examined and supported.

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_450">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1095">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2008.  It is important to remind people responsible for motor vehicles of road safety because of the massive scale of road accidents here every day.  Apart from responsible driving there is a role for others involved in transport.  There are incidents of bad practice on the part of cyclists who often jump red lights and cause havoc for motorists.  We need sensible and radical measures to deal with this because there are too many injuries and deaths on our roads.  While I accept the accident rate is higher because there are more vehicles on the roads people must drive responsibly.  People cause accidents through speeding and dangerous driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">There is an onus on car manufacturers to get involved in the debate about CO2 emissions.  Progressive people in the industry are considering ways to build new types of environmentally friendly vehicles.  They need also to consider noise pollution, and speeding.  I have raised this issue many times when discussing vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">On 30 January last I asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring in a new law on vehicular manslaughter.  The Minister drew my attention to the Law Reform Commission's report on Homicide: Murder and Involuntary Manslaughter and added:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1098">In respect of the criminal offence of manslaughter and related motoring offences the Commission has recommended that the existing road traffic offence of dangerous driving causing death should continue to exist alongside the more serious offence of manslaughter.  It would therefore be the case that where there is a very high degree of culpability, a driver responsible for a road death could be prosecuted for manslaughter.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1099">The Commission has also recommended the creation of a new offence of ‘careless driving causing death' to deal with fatalities caused by careless motoring.  The aspects of the Commission's Report relating to motoring offences are, of course, matters for The Minister for Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">I also raised with the Minister of Transport the issue of compulsory testing for alcohol of all drivers involved in road traffic accidents.  Following representations received from various bodies, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Seán Power, said that "the Department of Transport proposes to engage with the Office of the Attorney General to establish how the current legislation can be amended to achieve roadside testing of drivers involved in serious collisions subject to overriding medical circumstances".  These are sensible ideas and we need to include them in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">The detail of the Bill is set out in the explanatory memorandum.  The purpose of the Bill is:</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">(i) to give a permanent legislative basis for the motor tax increases effective from 1 February 2008 under a Financial Resolution passed by Dáil Eireann on 5 December 2007, and</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">(ii) to provide for a new motor tax system based on CO2 emissions for new and pre-owned imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008, as announced in the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's Carbon Budget on 6 December 2007. . .</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1104">The Financial Resolution passed by Dáil Eireann on 5 December 2007 provided for increases of 9.5% for cars below 2.5 litres and 11% for cars above that threshold.  A 9.5% increase also applied to goods and all other vehicles, with no increase for electric vehicles.  Trade plate licences also increased by 9.5%.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1105">Motor tax receipts are paid directly into the Local Government Fund which is ringfenced exclusively for local authority purposes.  It is estimated that the increases will generate additional revenue of about €83 million in a full year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">Ringfencing is the key word in this paragraph.  Other Departments should do this too because we need to face up to this issue.  Local authorities have a responsibility to be more actively involved.  I will advise my colleagues, particularly people who serve as councillors throughout the country, that it is important for them to make sure that their county and city managers are called to account to ensure that the revenue is spent in a sensible and logical way.  The sum of €83 million is a lot of extra money going into the system.  The explanatory memorandum continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1107">In Minister Gormley's 2008 Carbon Budget, he announced that, for new and pre-owned imported cars registered on or after the 1 July 2008, motor tax would be based on CO2 emissions rather than engine size, and that the new system would be accompanied by an informative labelling system.  Existing cars would continue to be taxed on the basis of engine size.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1108">The new system will involve the same seven CO2 bands as the new vehicle registration tax (VRT) system announced in Budget 2008, also to apply from 1 July 2008.  Annual motor tax rates range from €100 a year for the greenest cars, to €2,000 for cars with the highest emissions rating.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">It is fair and responsible to charge only €100 a year for the greenest cars which help the environment and health.  The explanatory memorandum:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1110">Section 3 involves a technical change, reducing the threshold from €114 to €99, above which a person can obtain a 3 or 6 monthly tax disc, to facilitate those paying the lowest rate under the new CO2 system. . .</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1111">Section 5 introduces two new definitions, related to the new CO2-based motor tax system, into Part II of the Schedule to the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952.  It also provides in that Schedule for revised motor tax rates for vintage/veteran vehicles.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1112">Section 6 provides for increased fees for trade plate licences and replacement trade plate licences in respect of motorcycles and all other vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">Sections 5 and 6 constitute sensible options and should be considered by Members.  The memorandum states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1114">The Schedule sets out the new motor tax rates for all vehicles except the rates for vintage/veteran vehicles, which are provided for in section 5, and the fees for trade plate licences, which are provided for in section 6.  Paragraph 6(<i>d</i>), provides for the new CO2 tax classes and associated rates.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1115">The insertion of a new schedule of rates is in keeping with the past practice, so that one can see at a glance the taxation class and relevant tax rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">These are the details of the legislation and are important parts of it.  The key points are the environmental impact it will have and the health and safety issues that are directly involved in this issue.  There is a general consensus among all Members of the Oireachtas that they must act on this issue.  It is important to make this point both in the legislation and in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">Earlier in the debate, I heard some Members criticise the Green Party.  The Green Party is making a contribution to the Government and I welcome its impact in this regard.  Its members are bringing forward some policies with which many people agree.  I do not accept much of the criticism that is taking place at present.  The two Green Party Ministers, Deputies Gormley and Eamon Ryan, are making an effort to do something in respect of their speciality, which I welcome, as do most objective people.  I do not accept the criticisms that were made previously.  While anyone may make mistakes, the bottom line is that both Ministers are doing their best, often against the odds, and I accept they have some highly sensible policies.  There will be strong support for them from all Members of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">I will revert to the legislation.  I refer to the motor tax rates that will apply to new and pre-owned imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008.  They are set out in paragraph 6(<i>d</i>) of the Schedule to the Bill, which will replace Part 1 of the Schedule to the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952.  The rates will be graduated as one moves up through the CO2 bands and it is important to consider the bands in detail.  As the Minister stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1119">For band A, which corresponds to CO2 emissions not exceeding 120 g per km, the motor tax rate will be €100.  The rate for band B, which corresponds to CO2 emissions of greater than 120 but not exceeding 140 g per km, will be €150.  The rate for band C will be €290, which corresponds to CO2 emissions of greater than 140 but not more than 155 g per km.  Band D, which corresponds to CO2 emissions of greater than 155 but not exceeding 170 g per km, will attract a rate of €430.  The rate for band E will be €600 . . .  Band F, which corresponds to CO2 emissions of greater than 190 and not more than 225 g per km, will attract a rate of €1,000.  For the top band, band G, the rate will be €2,000, which reflects CO2 emissions of more than 225 g per km.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">These details are important in the context of the legislation.  As this debate pertains to vehicles and transport, I will mention again a project that was carried out in my constituency, the Dublin Port tunnel.  It was a major project and many Members criticised the manner in which its costs went over budget.  However, one should bear in mind that the residents, particularly in Santry, Marino and Drumcondra, were proved right in respect of their concerns.  I am glad to note that compensation has been paid to many families in respect of the damage done.  The bottom line is that they warned that certain aspects of this project were dangerous and the residents of my constituency were proved to be right.  While a number of outstanding cases remain to be settled, I welcome the fact that many families in Dublin North-Central, particularly in Marino, Drumcondra and Santry, have now received their compensation.  This is an important matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">I raised this issue because all angles must be considered when one is engaged with major infrastructural transport problems that deal with trucks, cars and emissions.  While cost must be one such angle, public safety and the issue of damage to people's homes was not taken on board at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">Another aspect of this debate to which I referred previously concerns the issue of tax.  I mentioned the figure of €83 million in respect of this Bill, which to many people is an enormous sum of money.  This is money that must be spent.  It is taxpayers' money and belongs to people who drive their cars and pay their taxes every day.  Many people pay a lot of tax in Ireland and I commend the vast, silent majority who so do.  However, as legislators, Members have a responsibility to ensure that everyone pays their tax, which is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">This leads to the issue of public spending.   Were taxes to be spent on sensible public service projects many people would be highly responsible and supportive.  I raise this issue because the issue of tax is germane to the Bill.  The important point is that taxpayers' money should be spent on quality public services.  Those who work in such services also have a responsibility to ensure they are delivered in a sensible fashion.  When I heard the recent criticisms from the Minister for Transport, I agreed with him.  People in local authorities who are not doing their jobs in respect of this issue should accept responsibility for not so doing.  Members also have responsibility in this regard.  Parts of this country that do not have quality roads deserve them as a right.  This applies to everyone, particularly in rural Ireland where there are many places in which the roads are not at the same standard as obtains in urban areas.  Members who do not necessarily represent rural areas should be highly supportive in this regard because many tragedies take place on such small country roads.  I also heard Members' comments on signposting and other aspects of this issue.  I mention motor car manufacturers, which have a responsibility to create and design cars that are safe for the public.  Members will agree this issue is also linked to this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">I agree with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, when he stated "the clear objective of this new motor tax system is to influence the purchasing decisions of consumers".  This is an important objective of the legislation as Members must try to influence the purchasing decisions of consumers.  He went on to state "purchasers of cars with low CO2 emissions will be rewarded while a premium will be charged on vehicles with high CO2 emissions".  In other words, good practice will be rewarded, which is important.  As noted previously, he stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1125">. . . from 1 July 2008, anyone buying a new car or importing a pre-owned car can make a choice for the environment by purchasing a low CO2-emitting car and thus enjoy a lower rate of motor tax . . . . Alternatively, if the choice is to purchase a high CO2 emissions car, a higher rate of motor tax will apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">This also is fair.  It is both a contribution to the environmental issues and a major contribution to issues pertaining to health and safety.  The latter constitutes a highly important part of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">I refer to the number of new vehicles that are bought every year.  I understand approximately 150,000 people buy new cars every year in this country, which constitutes a huge market.  There is an opportunity for the motor industry, garage owners and people to become directly involved in the battle to do something about climate change and the creation of a healthier environment.  Everyone has a part to play and this is not simply a matter for Ministers or Oireachtas Members.  Many sections of the public are ahead of the posse on this issue and frequently do not object to taking the hit if it will lead to a cleaner and safer environment.  Many people can be highly sensible in respect of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">In his contribution, the Minister also referred to the significant role that the local government fund has played in the financing of local government since its establishment in 1999.  He stated "total funding for 2008 amounts to . . . €1.6 billion, which represents approximately 30% of local authority current funding requirements".  He then referred to the details by stating "The fund comprises two elements — [the] Exchequer contribution of €545 million and the proceeds of motor tax, which are projected to reach €1,080 million for 2008."  Members can see that as a massive amount of revenue is involved, this constitutes an opportunity for everyone to do something in this regard.  It is important to invest in safe cars of a high quality and to ensure the provision of safe roads of a high quality for our drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">One should consider the manner in which the local government fund plays a key role in funding regional and local roads.  These roads represent 94% of the country's road network and play an economic role.  They also have important and valuable social and community functions.  I emphasise the importance of local roads in the development of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">Public transport and its development comprise a very important part of this debate.  I welcome some of the progressive measures in the legislation but the reality is that we must do more, particularly in respect of train and bus services, especially on the north side of Dublin.  I will continue to push for these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">I raised the issue of the motor industry.  Some have concerns about the legislation and I accept some of them and the fact that they need to be addressed.  I have no doubt Deputies will become more involved in this debate.  I am not saying I want to block anything but we must have a broader debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">The objective of this legislation is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  It represents a beginning and it is progressive.  I am concerned about certain aspects of the Bill but it is very important that we all participate in this debate, particularly in respect of road safety, safer vehicles and taxation.  I welcome further debates on this important matter.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_1137">Sinn Féin supports measures taken to encourage the use of vehicles with lower carbon dioxide emissions and has been calling for this for some time, long before the Government decided to act.  Nonetheless, any steps in this direction are  welcome.  Encouraging people to use vehicles with lower emissions is obviously an important aspect of any strategy to reduce overall emission levels.  It is also necessary to create initiatives.  Any initiative that can reduce carbon dioxide emissions is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">It will be interesting to see whether the tax changes introduced in the budget will have the effect of reducing the sale of bigger cars, which have enjoyed a significant increase in market share in recent years.  Over the past ten years, there has been an explosion in the use of higher horse power cars and in the importation of cars with an engine capacity of 1,900 cu. cm. and higher from countries such as Japan and England, thus contributing to increased emissions.  On the other hand, there is significant evidence that motorists are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of reducing emissions and of their role in this regard.  In recent years, this has led to an increase in the market share of new vehicles that produce fewer emissions.  These accounted for almost 10% of new sales in 2006, while the second lowest category of vehicles accounted for another 22%.  In 2006, 32% of sales were of vehicles with engine capacity of under 1,400 cu. cm.  It seems certain, therefore, that tax incentives with lower carbon dioxide emissions will further increase this trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">Some have argued that tax on lower-emission vehicles should have been frozen and that the shortfall should have been made up by higher taxes on those cars with much higher emission levels.  Given the price involved, the disincentive to buying larger vehicles is perhaps not as great as imagined.  Freezing the tax on lower-emission vehicles would serve as a great incentive to buy and own such vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">Unfortunately, even the most optimistic projections regarding the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions accept that measures currently designed to reduce vehicle emissions will only make a small contribution to the overall target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland.  It is Sinn Féin's belief that the focus on tackling emissions from motor vehicles ought to be more pronounced and that an increase in the use of public transport should be achieved.  If there were a better funded and more efficient public transport system, there would not be so strong an incentive for so many people to drive to work and elsewhere in private cars.  I refer in particular to rural areas, where public transport is almost gone completely.  In many areas, there is none at all and people have no option but to use private vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">There have been some small successes regarding public transport in Dublin and the Luas serves as an example.  However, there needs to be a much broader approach if large numbers of people are to be persuaded to leave their cars at home.  If this were achieved, there would be far more significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions than would be possible through changing the vehicle taxation regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">The considerable incentive that exists for improving public transport as part of a strategy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is evident from the extremely small role public transport plays in generating emissions.  In 2006, the sector contributed just 4.1% of the total emissions in the State.  This figure decreased from 5.3% in 1990 and this is due to the reduction in rail transport emissions.  Emissions from private cars accounted for almost 37% of the total in 2006, although this figure also represented a decrease from that of 1990, mainly due to greater fuel efficiency, even though car ownership and use increased greatly over the same period.  The car testing system has been a major contributor to reducing emissions in that it put many deficient, unsafe cars off the road, which cars were contributing significantly to emission levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">The overall share of emissions produced by the transport sector has risen to 35%.  It is as clear as day that an increase in public transport use would have a significant and positive effect on emission levels and, for this reason alone, regardless of any other social benefits, it would be well worth investing more to achieve this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">Many other issues concerning motor vehicles are of concern.  Although the initial decision of last year on provisional licence holders was deferred, such that it would come into effect this summer, it will still cause problems for many.  While the motivation behind the announcement was undoubtedly to enhance road safety and encourage motorists with provisional licences to improve their driving skills and pass the test rather than be taken off the road as a result of failing it consistently, the longer waiting list has made it difficult for people in this category to pass their tests before June.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">The effects of the decision may not be known.  It was pointed out at the time of the decision, yet there is still a long waiting list for a driving test due to the failure to provide more testers at testing centres.  This will mean many motorists who are genuinely trying to pass their tests will not be able to qualify before the deadline or before their provisional licences expire, and thus they will be put off the road.  This will have a serious effect in many parts of the country, particularly more rural areas in which people are highly dependent on cars for transport.  This is another argument in favour of improving public transport provision.  It would also reduce the number of vehicles on the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">I must refer to road safety and the considerable carnage on our roads.  I believe firmly that driver training should be part of the school curriculum.  It is very important that young people learn good habits when they start driving.  Low insurance costs for cars with low engine capacities should act as an incentive.  If young people learn the rules of driving at a young age, it will carry them forward.  I urge the Minister of State and the relevant Departments to consider this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_455">
          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_1147">There is general understanding and consensus that transport is the big offender in the creation of CO2 emissions.  The level of carbon emissions in the transport sector has increased more than 200% since 1990 and projections show that the level will increase rather can decrease into the future.  Major measures need to be taken and a massive shift from private car use to use of public transport is required.  I would not hold my breath in terms of waiting for the Government to make that shift but it is clear that is what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">Regrettably, under the Transport 21 agenda, the public transport projects have fallen behind and, in some cases, are subject to considerable delays, whereas the road projects, in some cases, are ahead of schedule.  That shows there is still a mindset that favours the private car use over public transport use.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">The idea of using the taxation system to favour low carbon emission cars makes sense and it has general support.  The question I pose is whether the Minister has thought this out properly and in a way that will achieve the desired result.  That result must be twofold. It must deal with the issue of carbon emissions but, equally important, it must be fair.  That is something that has not been taken on board in the argument about climate change to the extent that is required.  There is also the question of efficiency.  Any scheme comprising seven bands is fraught with the potential to be overly bureaucratic.  A seven-band scheme is in place in this regard and that shows a certain muddled thinking in terms of how to make the changes to meet the required objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">Surprisingly, anomalies have been generated by the scheme unnecessarily, to which I will refer shortly.  This scheme was not initiated by the new Government.  Many people are of the view that the Green Party in government is responsible for it, but to be fair to the Tánaiste, Deputy Cowen, he outlined in the previous budget in some detail his intention to engage in consultation on changing VRT to meet environmental requirements.  He said that the reasons for making such a move include the environmental aspects, the impact on the Exchequer, equity, administrative taxation and economic efficiency aspects.  These were all aspects that were required to be taken into account when making the move.  He also made an interesting point that many of us have forgotten.  In his previous budget speech he maintained that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would also consult on the matter and there would be a complementary rebalancing of annual motor tax.  He said this would provide a further incentive through the motor tax system for the motoring public to drive cleaner cars.  He said this would apply to vehicles registered on or after 1 January 2008.  The Greens are in government and such a scheme has been introduced, but it will not come into effect until 1 July 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">Some people took the Minister, Deputy Cowen, at his word and ordered cars with low emissions on 1 January 2008, but they feel damned sore about this matter.   I am sure other Deputies have received e-mails from people who took the Minister at his word and bought a low emissions car, but now find that for the lifetime of their use of that car, they will be penalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">One person who e-mailed me on the matter wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1153">As an early adopter of the green message . . . I ordered a diesel vehicle . . . with the full intention and knowledge that I was doing my piece for the environment.  My new car's CO2 rating is certified at 128g, which would mean under the new regime a VRT reduction from 30% to 16%, and an annual motor tax reduction from approx 560 to 90 euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">This unfortunate man has now discovered to his cost that is not the case.  He has been caught even though he did the right thing and was guided by the indicators in the Government policy on changes in this area.  He went on to make the point that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1155">Further compounding the injustice of the Minister's action in not amending the system, is the fact that imported second hand cars, with the relevant CO2 clearance, are to be taxed after July 1st on emissions and not engine capacity.  This means that a car bought in the UK on the same date as my diesel car . . . can be imported into the state [and will be subject to the new regime for its lifetime].</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">He made the further point that ". . . it also opens up the possibility that a car purchased on the same date in Ireland prior to July the 1st 2008, could be exported out of the state and then re-imported after July 1st . . . at the lower taxation rate!"  These are the types of anomalies that have been brought to our attention.  They indicate a certain lack of coherence and consistency in terms of the policy, even though the policy is sound.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">It is a small measure if one reflects on the totality of what needs to be done.  The biggest single political challenge we face is climate change.  An interesting presentation on bio-fuels was made at the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security today.  Concern has been expressed about the efficiency of bio-fuels, the bio-fuels that should be developed and their energy usage.  Rapeseed, which was considered to be the way to proceed in terms of the development of bio-fuels, has a very low energy yield and many difficulties are attached to its production, which make it inefficient in terms of its usage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">The most common crop we grow, by far, is grass.  Interestingly, it was clear from today's presentation that we could, if we chose to do so, convert grass to gas to service fleets of buses, transport and even trains.  That is an interesting idea given that another natural resource, wind energy, is readily available in view of our climate and is also appropriate to meeting needs.  Efforts have been made by the Department responsible to encourage the development of wind energy to generate electricity, but no efforts have been made by the Minister for Transport or his Department to encourage research and development into bio-fuels to meet the need to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">I did not know that there was such a thing as belly grass.  It is grass that is extracted from the carcasses of cows and pigs in the slaughter house.  This grass is perfect for conversion to gas, which can be used as a fuel in transport.  This is the type of development that is required.  Such development has happened in other countries, which such fuel is being used in an economic fashion, but such development is not taking place here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">I have great concerns that the Minister for Transport who appeared before the committee to which I referred relatively recently gave a presentation which did not show the understanding, concern, commitment, focus and information one would require from a Minister dealing with the sector that creates the biggest problem in terms of the level of carbon emissions.  A sea change by the Government is needed in this area.  I criticised the Taoiseach this morning for not showing leadership in this regard.  If he spoke out on the issue on climate change, it would help to generate a sea change in terms of what needs to be done in different sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">I am happy to support the Green Party in its efforts.  It is making a genuine effort in its fields of environment and energy.  I would criticise it if it were not doing that well enough, but I agree with its fundamentals.  The big change has to occur in other sectors such as agriculture and transport, however.  If it does not happen in those sectors we will have no chance of meeting not just the Kyoto targets — which we have overshot completely — but the 3% reduction per annum target set by the Government.  Everybody in Government will look pretty foolish at the end of five short years if they have not made a real dent in terms of moving the tank around.  A 3% reduction is a big challenge, but it is in line with the directive, in effect, coming from the EU as regards what this country has to do.  We cannot rely simply on shelling out money for carbon credits.  That is not feasible into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">This particular measure in terms of vehicle taxation and VRT is a good one, within the bigger picture.  I wish it had been a great measure and that the Minister had sorted out the anomalies——</p>

          <p eId="para_1164">Not always.  However, I wish he had got to grips with the anomalies.  People went back to the Minister for Finance's commitment in the previous year.  The public understood that environmental taxes of this nature were coming down the tracks.  It was not just seen as a threat.  Many people welcome change that will enable better practice, more conservation and reduced carbon emissions.  Those who accepted the Minister for Finance's commitments and statements in the previous budget were very disappointed to find that a Green Party Minister was not, in fact, living up to them.  I find that anomalous in itself, and that people who chose the most appropriate cars in terms of saving the planet now find they will be penalised for that.  That seems to be a very regrettable outcome, not in the spirit of this taxation measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165">The other area the Minister needs to consider seriously — and it cannot be hived off to the Commission on Taxation — is how this might affect local authority funding.  The local government fund depends on motor tax to a great extent.  I believe it is about 70% of the fund.  We have not had a clear answer in terms of what the impact will be on local authority funding.  When the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, spoke about this in the previous year, he said it would be neutral in terms of taxation, but we do not have a guarantee now as regards local authority funding, which is a crucial issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_458">
          <from>Deputy Cyprian Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_1166">I wish to share time with Deputy Cregan, with the permission of the House.  I do not have much experience of belly grass but we have an enormous challenge in front of us.  I fully support the implementation of the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill because it is one of the most important steps we must take if we are to seriously meet the challenge of reducing our CO2 emissions.  It is a major challenge, not just for Ireland.  We have all seen the documentaries and films, and listened to the various NGOs and groups involved in this area.  It is a global challenge and this country's gas emissions currently amount to some 70 million tonnes.  This has to be reduced to an annual average of 63 million tonnes between now and 2012 in order to meet our Kyoto commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">Each of us contributes to carbon emissions.  Research shows that transport represents about 20% of emissions, energy accounts for 22%, industry around 17% and agriculture 28%.  It is in all our interests to take on that challenge.  Changing the way we pay our VRT from July this year means that everyone buying a new car will have its VRT rate determined by its carbon dioxide emission rating and it will no longer be related to engine size.  I would request we get some form of standardisation in measurements, particularly among the car manufacturers, because that is an issue we shall have to take into account when we are introducing these measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">Motor tax also increases under the Bill depending on the size of the engine.  For example, the motor tax changes are 9.5% for cars below 2.5 litres and 11% for vehicles above that threshold.  When it is considered that since the last increase in 2004, there has been a 15% hike in inflation, this is well within that limit.  Car owners, of whom I am one, are prepared to contribute towards reducing CO2 emissions.  This is reflected in the fact that 95% of cars on Irish roads are under 2 litres.  I believe car owners are in favour of the fact that the additional funds raised from VRT and motor tax will be used primarily to finance the development of regional and local roads.  Again, it is a matter of guaranteeing and showing people that they are getting value for money in terms of where their money is going.  When one looks at the manner in which the bin charges were introduced, for instance, there was a great deal of furore initially.  People then saw the benefits and the system is now working quite well.  The reinvestment of these taxes into the development of regional and local roads is essential.  We have all seen the improvements that have taken place on primary routes and motorways throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">This positive action is only one of the many initiatives we must implement if we are to reduce the need for the use of cars and ultimately CO2 emissions.  In Dublin, for example, more and more commuters are availing of additional public transport services to get to and from the city.  We have good quality bus corridors in place, which are very successful.  We have increased train and DART services.  The introduction of Luas along with the opening of the port tunnel has taken more cars and trucks out of the city than any increase in car tax could possibly do.  I see the benefits of this at first hand.  Deputy Finian McGrath mentioned the port tunnel, and I see the enormous difference that has made to areas such as the East Wall and North Wall, not just to the climate and environment, but to living conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">We must continue to improve our infrastructure and public transport service.  I am delighted that national and local government have ring-fenced funding to achieve this through the national development plan.  However, as a public representative for Dublin Central, I ask that those involved in bringing in the new public transport services do so in a co-ordinated, properly planned and managed manner.  All of us who work and live in the city centre suffered as a result of the delays in the introductions of the Luas and the port tunnel, for instance.  Both of these projects took much more time than originally planned.  As a result, residents in central Dublin and hundreds of thousands of people coming to work every day were subjected to long traffic jams.  We had queues of buses, cars, goods vehicles and taxis all stuck on the major arteries coming in and out of the city.  They were sitting there for long periods, emitting a great deal of CO2.  I have always held that the whole thrust of traffic management in Dublin should be towards facilitating a fast throughput of traffic through the city.  Whether that is by means of integrated traffic lights, priority being given to buses and trams or other measures, it is an essential part of any forward planning that needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">In Dublin city in particular, we are now facing into a series of major construction projects over the next decade.  The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, is currently planning for the construction of the new metro line from Swords to St. Stephen's Green, the construction of a new rail interconnector line between Heuston and Connolly stations and a link between the two Luas routes, all essential projects for which the city is crying out.  In addition, major construction works are due to commence in many parts of the inner city, for instance the old Carlton cinema site in O'Connell Street, the Department of Health and Children offices in Hawkins Street and the old offices of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Work on a new Macken Street bridge on the Liffey is to begin shortly and there is also major construction at the Mater hospital site.  All this work is due to take place over the next few years.  Unless it is properly planned, however, Dublin city will be a building site, totally unsuited to work in or live in and totally inaccessible to visitors.  That is in nobody’s interest.   We need to be logical about how these projects are put in place.  I welcome the Minister for Transport’s common-sense approach in stopping the introduction of any congestion charges until such time as the public transport work is carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">I ask all the relevant agencies and the construction companies to adopt a similar common sense approach to this work which is essential to the future of Dublin city.  Those living and working in the city still remember the problems, the congestion and the effects on the environment of construction projects that took twice as long to complete than originally planned.  I refer to the Luas project.  Ten or 12 years ago, we spent five years fighting to get the Luas in place and now that it is up and running and paid for, it is the best thing since sliced bread.  These projects must be properly planned and must be completed as efficiently and as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">I note the improvements which have taken place, in particular in the area of planning.  Proper planning is essential if we want to make a difference to the environment.  It is important to ensure the plans are not limited solely to engineering requirements but that they take into account the needs of the families living in the area and the shops and the shop workers whose livelihood relies on a regular flow of visitors to the city.  All these elements must be considered.  I note the bids system which is operational in Dublin city which will also facilitate planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">Allowing engineers to take over the livelihood and the living conditions of the people of Dublin is not acceptable nor is it acceptable to allow engineers to take double the time to complete construction projects.  This creates traffic jams, wreaks havoc on the city and does nothing to reduce the CO2 emissions but rather increases them.  These projects must be planned and managed properly as this is the only way to effect the changes proposed in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175">This work is vital for the city and I support it.  However, Dublin City Council and the new proposed traffic authority need to take control of the co-ordination of work to ensure that the city can continue to live and breathe.  If this is achieved and the new public transport services are delivered on time with the minimum disruption to the people who use the city, we can make a real difference.  The measures proposed will have the desired effect.  The reduction in reliance on car use will contribute to emissions reductions that are required.  It has been proven that commuters will use the new services.  Dublin Bus passenger numbers have increased significantly since the introduction of the QBCs.  The DART has been a success and its construction was a major project.  There was much scepticism at the time as to whether people would use the service.  In the end the service had to be expanded, extra rolling stock was purchased and station platforms were extended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176">In supporting the introduction of this new Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences)Bill 2008, the timely introduction of a proper public transport service will ensure the proposed changes will make a real difference in the efforts to reduce emissions.  I compliment both Ministers on this legislation.  We have all listened to what we should and should not do.  The previous speaker pointed out that the Minister for Finance had included many of these measures in his projections in previous budgets.  The implementation of this legislation will ensure that the required effect is obtained from the changes made.  People are willing to make change.  It is in everybody's interest and in the interests of the generations to come.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Cregan</from>
          <p eId="para_1177">The purpose of this Bill is twofold: to provide a permanent legislative basis for the motor tax increases approved by the Dáil by way of a financial resolution on budget day and to give statutory effect to the new carbon dioxide-based motor tax system for new and pre-owned imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">Road transport generates approximately one fifth of the EU's CO2 emissions, with passenger cars responsible for approximately 12%.  Although recent years have seen improvements in vehicle technology, particularly in fuel-efficiency which translates into lower CO2 emissions, this has not been sufficient to stem the growth in emissions due mainly to increased car ownership and increased car size.  While the EU reduced overall emissions of greenhouse gases by almost 5% between 1990 and 2004, our CO2 emissions from road transport rose by 26%.  This was despite a reduction of more than 12% in average new car CO2 emissions between 1995 and 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">The situation in Ireland is even more stark.  While road transport accounts for a similar portion of total emissions, we have seen an increase in emissions from road transport by more than 180% between 1990 and 2006.  This reflects growth from relatively low car ownership levels in 1990 and is a trend that seems set to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">In this context the Government has decided to move from a motor tax regime where the charge is based on the engine size, to one based on carbon emissions.  This was first mooted by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, when he introduced the budget before last.  The then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, would have commenced the consultative process.  I commend the current Minister, Deputy John Gormley for continuing this initiative and for introducing this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">I have a problem with the legislation and I made a statement outside the House in this regard.  I wish to be consistent and put my remarks on the record of the House.  My difficulty is with the six-month lead-in period from January to July.  As other speakers said, we are setting out to reward those who are responsible and who buy cars with lower emissions and to penalise those who want to be irresponsible and make the choice to drive the gas guzzlers.  In taking this action, I see a serious anomaly being created in this legislation.  In the period 1 January to 1 July, a car with lower emissions would attract a discount on VRT after 1 July and lower motor tax after 1 July.  Buyers are being penalised because for the lifetime of such a car it will always be taxed as a high taxation car.  A comparable car bought a month later will be far more attractive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">Statistics show that new car sales were up 3% in the month of January.  I was a little taken aback because it was defeating the purpose of my argument but when I delved further I found that much of that increase was attributed to cars having been pre-booked in October and November by people who were probably not <i>au fait </i>with what was going to happen after July.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">I am open to correction but I understand there is a substantial drop in car sales for the month of February.  I am at a loss to understand why the motor trade is not saying something.  I have been contacted by constituents who have chosen to cancel their new car orders and wait until after July.  I wonder where this leaves the jobs in the motor trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">I fully support the thrust of the Bill and the shift from engine size taxation to emissions taxation and this goes without saying.  However, if this legislation is passed by the Oireachtas, I am at a loss to understand why we must wait until July.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">I understand the Minister addressed some of these questions in his speech.  He stated it would be unfair to penalise people for a purchasing decision made in the past.  It is equally unfair to penalise a person who is doing the right thing and purchasing a car with lower emissions.  I ask the Minister to examine this proposal with a view to lessening that penalty on the people who are making the right decision and doing the right thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">We have made great strides in other aspects of reducing CO2 emissions but the most difficult challenge is in the area of transportation and CO2 emissions from cars.  I greatly welcome the thrust of the Bill which will ensure we will make a big impact and live up to our responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">Climate change is profound in its implications for the planet and its inhabitants and represents a very significant challenge for society.  It cuts to the core of modern living and commercial activity.  The solution is clear.  We must reduce human induced emission of greenhouse gases quickly if we are to avoid the worst impact of climate change.  We all have a responsibility to play our part.  While in global terms Ireland's emissions may be relatively small, it is essential that we apply the resourcefulness and initiative that has delivered very significant economic success in the past decade to the challenge of adapting to a low carbon society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">Along with our EU colleagues we have been to the forefront in bringing the Kyoto Protocol into force.  Our efforts to secure global agreement and deep cuts in emissions must be backed up with a commensurate level of ambition at home.  The programme for government and the carbon budget, which the Minister delivered in December, make it clear that we are up for that challenge.  I commend the Minister.  An earlier speaker referred to the role being played by the Ministers, Deputies Gormley and Ryan, as Green Party Ministers in the Government.  I commend them in playing a very positive role in the Government in recent months.  I work closely with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, through my chairmanship of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  That relationship has been very positive and I am sure others have the same experience with the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  I commend them because they have been criticised.  They have been tough enough to take that criticism and continue with the job of work at hand and remain focused.  They have both been involved in introducing important legislation into the House, which I am satisfied and proud to support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">The local government fund, which is very important, has been mentioned.  The ring fencing of motor taxation for local government usage is also important.  I welcome that it will continue.  It is put to very good use.  We depend on it for the maintenance and upgrading of our roads in all local authority areas.  It is important that it is maintained at a high level.  The highways being built throughout the country are the responsibility of the National Roads Authority and billions of euro are being spent on them.  That is fine until a driver comes off those highways and motorways into rural areas of Limerick, Cork, Kerry or wherever.  People who are paying decent money for their motor vehicles should be entitled to drive with a high level of safety and comfort.  The low cost safety improvement works scheme was mentioned recently.  It has specific funding allowing local authorities to identify problem areas and black spots, and have remedial work carried out.  Such funding is also very important because local funding may not be adequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">I welcome the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to carry out a final review with a view to trying to ensure that the maximum number of people, who are responsible and doing the right thing, and who are doing as we ask and buying cars with lower emissions, can get the benefit of this at the earliest possible date.  I would have no difficulty if somebody missed out in the first six months and could not get the benefit.  However, I have considerable difficulty when somebody doing the right thing will never be able to get the benefit during the lifetime of that car because the passport does not cover that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_1193">The Bill has two purposes.  The first objective is to increase motor tax, which was the purpose of the Financial Resolution passed on budget night on 5 December.  The Bill simply gives effect to that.  I cannot welcome that portion of the Bill.  It is just a tax measure, which increases motor tax by an amount far in excess of the rate of inflation.  What happened was quite clear.  During the Estimates campaign, conducted by the Minister for Finance, there was a shortage of money in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  After the required cuts were made, the Minister was allowed by the Minister for Finance to recover money lost in the Estimates campaign by increasing motor tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">He increased the tax on cars of less than 2.5 litre by 9.5% and he increased the tax on cars of more than 2.5 litre by 11%.  According to the Minister for Finance the projected rate of inflation for 2008 is 3.5%, which means that the increase for cars more than 2.5 litre is three times the rate of inflation and the increase for cars less than 2.5 litre is 2.5 times the rate of inflation.  This is purely a tax collection measure that has nothing to do with green policies or protecting the environment.  There is a nod in that direction by having a 2% differential between the greater than 2.5 litre cars and the less than 2.5 litre cars.  That 2% will make no difference in customer practice or in people purchasing cars.  They will not change their minds about what they want for the sake of a 2% differential in the increase in car tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">The Minister knew what he was doing and on his own figures he will collect €83 million in a full year on this measure.  That is just a tax increase, cleverly signed off by the Minister for Finance into the remit of the Minister or the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  We have the novel thing, a carbon budget, in which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was allowed the privilege of announcing an €83 million imposition on the private motorist the day after the budget.  It is an unfair tax increase, which when considered with all the other costs of motoring, is a heavy burden on taxpayers.  I resent that it is being presented as some kind of environmental measure — it is not.  It is just a way to collect tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">Yesterday the price of oil exceeded $100 again.  There is no doubt that this will be followed by significant increase at the pumps.  Cars are expensive.  Car tax is expensive.  VRT is expensive.  Petrol and diesel are expensive, and tolls are becoming increasingly expensive.  One of the anomalies of Government policy is that the more disadvantaged areas of the country with less economic growth will be the areas with the highest frequency of tolls on roads.  That is perverse and should not happen.  It happened because the roads were priority listed.  At the top of the list were the roads to be funded by the public capital programme and consequently had no tolls applied.  Further down the roads programme list were roads that could only be constructed with a private sector involvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">In my and Deputy Breen's part of the country we will be paying tolls to travel under the Shannon in the Shannon tunnel through which we hope to be driving in two years' time.  However, if I were in Cork I could drive through the Jack Lynch Tunnel as many times a day as I liked free of charge.  Many people living on my side of the river work in Deputy Breen's constituency at Shannon Airport.  They will be paying the tolls at least twice a day.  Many others living on Deputy Breen's side of the river in the Caherdavin area work in the Raheen Industrial Estate and go home for lunch.  They would pay four tolls a day if they are not to jam up the traffic in the city centre as is happening at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">When the other project in our area is completed, the road from Limerick to Nenagh, it will also have a toll.  When it links with the motorway from Castletown near Portlaoise we will have another toll to get to Portlaoise.  Drivers will be able to travel from the economically advantaged part of the country, from Dublin to Portlaoise, without paying any toll.  However, those driving from west of the Shannon, through Limerick and up to Portlaoise will need to pay two tolls, one to get under the Shannon and another after reaching Annacotty on the way up from Nenagh to Portlaoise.  One might say these are small impositions on the private motorist and while they add to the cost of motoring they do not influence the terms of competition or trade.  They are a major imposition on the carriage of freight, however, and make our part of the country uncompetitive.  I would like this matter to be re-examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">I welcome the Bill's second proposal.  It is not before time that car tax moved from the basis of engine capacity to emissions.  While it is a good measure, it is a pity that it simply borrows the UK system without looking at local conditions or attempting to remove anomalies.  Under the terms of the Bill, a low-emission car imported from Britain or Northern Ireland will have a lower road tax than a car of the same model and year that is being driven around the roads of Ireland at present or that is bought secondhand off the forecourt.  In the long term, it is not feasible to have two different tax regimes for the same cars with the same emissions and same year of purchase.  The market will decide the issue because low-emission cars will be brought in from the United Kingdom, whereas high emission cars will not.  The first problem will be that low-emission cars on Irish forecourts will not be sold and will therefore decrease in value.  As low and high-emission cars lose value it probably will not have any influence in the long term on customer choice, which was promulgated by the Minister as the primary purpose of this Bill — that is, to influence the choice exercised by motorists when purchasing new cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">My final point concerns the general VRT issue, which I mentioned before.  According to a schedule published in <i>The Irish Times</i> the car I drive, which is a BMW 320 diesel, would carry a VRT rate of approximately €12,900 before the changes are introduced.  After the changes, if it were a new car, the VRT rate would be reduced to approximately €6,800.  I am driving a green car but according to the Minister’s proposals the value of my car will fall by approximately €6,000 from 1 July 2008.  I might recover that if I were to exchange like with like on a trade-in, but if I change models and want to buy something else the trade-in value of my low-emission car will go down.  I will be penalised further because under the new schedule it will carry a lower car tax after 1 July if it is a new car, but because it is secondhand I will not get the advantage of the lower tax.  I will, therefore, be paying a higher rate of tax than a person who imports a 2004 BMW 320 diesel from the United Kingdom.  That is anomalous, unfair and should not happen.  The Minister and his departmental advisers need to reconsider the matter in order to remove those anomalies from the system.</p>

        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_463">
          <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_1201">I welcome the opportunity to highlight some of the pitfalls of the Bill currently before us.  I concur with my colleague, Deputy Noonan, that some of the Bill's measures are unfair and I urge the Minister to consider changes to the current proposals.  We all welcome the move to address Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  The EU considers Ireland to have a high carbon footprint and has demanded that we reduce our greenhouse gases by 20% from 2005 levels by 2020.  We are one of three countries to be so targeted, along with Denmark and Luxembourg.  The argument is often made about climate change that we must choose between the economy and the environment but this is not the case.  We can effect change at little cost if the Government takes action and its policies give people time to adapt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">When he attends meetings around the world, Al Gore's message is that we should drive less.  If the Government is serious about tackling climate change it needs to invest in rail infrastructure so that consumers have a reliable and efficient alternative.  I welcome the Government's commitment to open the western rail corridor, for which we all campaigned.  It is a good move and I hope the railway line will be open by next year.  However, I have some concerns about the Limerick-Galway line.  Many Members will have seen on television recently that part of the Ennis-Limerick line is flooded.  The line has been closed for about three weeks due to flooding at Ballycar, Newmarket-on-Fergus, which is affecting many people.  Between 600 and 700 people a day use that service from Ennis to Limerick, but as a result of the line closure they must drive their cars, thus congesting the roads, or take buses into Limerick.  However, buses do not constitute the most efficient means of travel.  I urge the Minister and his officials to address this difficulty.  The OPW and Iarnród Éireann have had talks on the situation but I urge the Government and Iarnród Éireann to take steps to raise the line at Ballycar in order to resolve the problem.  This work was to have been undertaken ten years ago but unfortunately it was not done.  If the railway continues to be flooded for one or two months per year it will affect the line's viability.  In addition, if the matter is not resolved, it will also affect the viability of the Ennis to Galway line which is due to open next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">A commuter stop at Crusheen on the Ennis-Athenry line was included in the north Clare area plan.  Clare County Council is supportive of the project but Iarnród Éireann has said it will not locate a stop there.  I had hoped the matter could be resolved as Crusheen is a large growth area with a catchment including Tulla, Clooney, Ruan and Barefield.  It would help if people could park their cars at Crusheen before commuting to Galway, Ennis or Limerick.  Therefore I urge Iarnród Éireann to establish a stop at Crusheen on this commuter line.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">To revert to the essence of what we are discussing in the context of this Bill, the car industry is already adapting to the development of fuel-efficient cars but the German Government has reservations about it.  The EU was trying to cut down pollution late last year but the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she was not in favour of the proposal which would not be economically favourable for Germany given the fact that many large car manufacturers are located there, such as Porsche, Mercedes and BMW.  The latter company is totally against the new EU measures, which it believes will distort the market.  Meanwhile, French car manufacturers such as Peugeot say the measures will favour non-European car makers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">Car ownership in Ireland is growing at 5% annually and passenger cars account for over 10% of CO2 emissions.  According to the latest census figures, 84.8% of households in County Clare own at least one car.  With public transport not an option in rural Ireland, people need cars to travel to work.  Some commuters have already chosen to drive low-emission cars and many to whom I have spoken are critical of the new motor taxation system which they feel is unfair.  Instead of encouraging motorists to contribute to climate change, the system penalises them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">I am delighted to see the Minister, Deputy Gormley, in the Chamber again.  I listened to his earlier contribution as I was doing some research this morning.  He said his officials had examined the alternatives but that they were not appropriate.  He also said that no data on CO2 emissions were available for cars prior to 2001.  The Minister has rushed this proposal through without looking at the implications, so he should re-examine the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">My understanding is that CO2 emissions ratings relate to cars manufactured since 2001.  I know a person who bought a Volkswagen Golf 1.9 TDI last week and paid motor tax of some €560.  If this person bought the same car after 1 July, the emissions tax payable would be only €150.  A system where one person must pay more than another to purchase the same model of car, manufactured in the same country and producing the same emissions is unfair.  To add insult to injury, owners of existing cars that are still being taxed at the old rate are facing an increase of 11%.  This is another stealth tax.  How can one justify the increase in respect of small cars that are already environmentally friendly?</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">Motor manufacturers are trying to curb this EU move to reduce carbon pollution.  Many German manufacturers, for example, are concerned at what will become of the motor industry in that country.  Problems will arise after 1 July in regard to the purchase of second-hand cars.  In particular, garages near the Border will experience difficulties because it will be cheaper for people to purchase second-hand cars in the North.  Second-hand cars will be left on the forecourts of garages.  We saw what happened in garages in Border areas some years ago as a consequence of the difference in the price of petrol and diesel in the two jurisdictions.  Many of these garages closed down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">The Minister should review these unfair provisions.  Deputy Noonan referred to them as a mere tax collection measure.  The Government must begin thinking outside the box in an effort to reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  The programme for Government commits to a 3% reduction per year.  However, if the Government continues to introduce ill thought out proposals such as these, it will not reach its target.  I ask the Minister to consider the example I gave of the car that is subject to motor tax of €560 now but only €150 in four months' time.  This is representative of an inequitable and unfair system that must be reviewed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_464">
          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_1210">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Most people, not least the Minister, would agree that in terms of reducing CO2 emissions and meeting our Kyoto commitments, this is not a time for timid measures.  Rather, we must take a brave and far-reaching approach.  That is why it is such a surprise that the provisions announced at the time of the budget and introduced in this Bill amount merely to a blanket increase in motor tax, just like most other years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">If the Minister were serious about reducing CO2 emissions, he would not have introduced a flat tax that is scarcely related to engine size and not at all related to emissions or usage.  As my colleagues observed, it applies to all existing cars purchased before 1 July.  No matter how small or efficient these cars, the increase in tax must be paid over the lifetime of the car.  This makes no sense.  As my colleague, Deputy Noonan, said, it is not fair to penalise somebody who has made a sound environmental decision by choosing a car with low emissions.  Such persons will be penalised until they sell that car.  On the other hand, these provisions will reward those who postpone the decision to make an environmentally friendly choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">Why was July chosen?  Most people purchase cars in January and few do so in July.  It occurred to me that this may be some type of sop to the motor industry to give them a second January in the year, but I am sure there is nothing so Machiavellian at play.  The reality, however, is that few people buy a car in the second half of the year.  Any impact, therefore, will be delayed for another year.  This is certainly not a brave and far-reaching measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">One cannot escape the conclusion that these provisions, dressed up to look as though they arise from environmental concern, are purely about raising revenue.  It is estimated the new system will bring in some €83 million for the Exchequer.  All this will do, however, is raise the cost of motoring, which is already expensive.  It will not be a deterrent but it will raise the cost.  Green Party Ministers, especially the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, are beginning to look like patsies for Fianna Fáil, the Ministers who raise taxes and take all the associated criticism.  They are patted on the back by Fianna Fáil for being environmentally aware but are essentially merely raising taxes on that party's behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">I am not even sure it is legal to charge people different tax rates for the same car and to do so indefinitely.  If it is legal, it is extremely unfair.  Those unfortunate persons who have already purchased efficient cars or do so before 1 July not only will derive no benefit but they will be taxed at a higher rate and will lose out in terms of the resale value of their cars.  It is a double whammy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">There is a thorough lack of planning, coherence, logic and consistency in Government efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and greenhouse gases and to deal with environmental issues generally.  Perhaps this is because a degree of panic is setting in now that it seems increasingly unlikely we will meet the 3% target set by the Government and for which the EU is constantly pushing.  There is even less chance of reaching that target if we continue to treat the public like recalcitrant children.  There is significant enthusiasm among the public to change behaviours and take responsibility for protecting the environment.  However, people require assistance, encouragement and information, together with fiscal and financial incentives in any way the Government can provide.  It seems bizarre that it is a Green Party Minister who is concentrating on the stick rather than the carrot.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">Since this Government was formed, the penal approach has been taken in the case of several environmental measures.  There is the promised ban on traditional light bulbs, an increase in landfill tax, this proposal in regard to motor tax, threats of carbon taxes and the purchase of carbon taxes in our name.  Where was the Minister when the Government made the decision not to introduce competition in the bus service?  All these measures will merely antagonise the public and will certainly not encourage people to waste less, drive less and save energy in any way.  There seems to be no realistic, workable plan to bring people on board to work together towards reducing our carbon credit requirements or at least make sizeable progress in that direction.  It is a common project upon which we must all embark and it is not something the Government can impose only through the stick and without any carrot.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">The two main sources of our emissions are transport, which is an area of significant growth, and domestic heating.  To suppose that new building standards for future builds will make a significant difference is nonsense.  It is undoubtedly important that we have new standards for new builds, but what about the existing housing stock which is the bulk of capital?  In the past ten years, some 500,000 new homes have been built.  The housing capital formation for this generation has happened.  It is there and it is abysmally insulated, as the Minister knows.  The houses in question were built using hollow blocks, which is just about the worst way to build a house in terms of insulation.  That was done over many years with the blessing of the Government.  What does the Government propose to do to reduce the substantial heating bills faced by Irish people?  What will it do to make any kind of significant inroads into our carbon emissions?</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">Given that Ireland's climate is quite mild, despite what we have experienced over recent days, a properly constructed and insulated house can almost be heated with a candle, as the Minister is probably aware.  However, we are pumping out gas and oil to try to heat the atmosphere.  We are literally trying to heat the sky as we bring up the temperature of our houses.  Such behaviour is costing every home a great deal of money, destroying the environment, increasing our dependence on fuel imports, affecting this country's balance of payments, creating an unpleasant living environment and causing a catastrophic increase in carbon emissions.  Energy and carbon credits which might be used fruitfully by Irish industry are being pumped away as part of a futile attempt to heat our homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">The single most useful thing the Government could do to reduce carbon emissions and meet our Kyoto commitments would be to launch a major drive to transform the insulation value of existing Irish homes.  The big stick will not work.  People need information and a fiscal incentive.  If the Government does not favour the introduction of a grant scheme — I do not see why that should be the case — it should consider the provision of a system of tax relief or any other system that would act as a carrot in incentivising people to follow a good example.  The existing housing stock of the entire nation must be upgraded.  It is a waste of time to talk about new builds because there will be very little new building over the next few years.  If the attic insulation of every home were to be increased to 18 in, it would have an substantial impact on heating bills throughout the country.  Why is such a scheme not being introduced?  Not only would it be a "no-brainer" for any Government that is interested in taking a big and brave step, but it would also be infinitely more attractive than threatening people with carbon taxes if they do not stop heating their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">The imposition of additional taxes on the owners of cars, particularly taxes which are not related to engine size, emissions or frequency of car use, is a blunt and ineffective instrument when trying to change behaviour.  People in rural Ireland need cars to travel to work and to socialise.  In the absence of a suitable rail freight system — the existing system suffers from the attitude of our train company and the indifference of the Government — hauliers need to use the roads to transport goods.  Some people have to use their cars but, given that most of our population now lives in our cities, most people could use public transport if a decent system were available to them.  We will have to wait at least 20 years for the metro, etc., to be completed and an adequate public transport network to be in place.  It will be too late by then.  We need buses now.  Where are the buses?  No progress has been made in that regard, despite ten years of promises.  The percentage of commuters travelling by bus is decreasing every year.  A decision has been taken to stick with the old system.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday, "there is no change in the system that has been operating for the past ten years".</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">We are penalising people by introducing landfill taxes without offering alternatives.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that his plan to prevent local authorities, or anybody else, from securing a guaranteed stream of waste is leading to absolute chaos.  If he proceeds with that plan, there will be problems.  The local authority in my local area is constructing a ground waste facility, but it does not know whether it will have any waste to put in it.  We should be making planned and careful decisions about the environment, but instead there is absolute chaos.  Consumers make choices every day — they decide what to buy, how to travel and how to heat their homes, for example.  The Minister should encourage people to make sound environmental choices and to change their purchasing behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">Last week, when the House debated services for people with autism, Deputies spoke about the applied behaviour analysis method as if they knew what it is all about.  Anyone who knows anything about behavioural analysis or even about human nature — one would not need to have any background in psychology — will appreciate that the carrot is more effective than the stick.  If one penalises people with taxes, one will change their behaviour temporarily.  If one really wants to engender enthusiastic and long-term change, one must use the carrot.  If one wants people to buy into the concept of resource conservation, one must give them personal and compelling incentives to change their behaviour.  The proposed tax, which is marginally related to engine size and certainly not related to usage or emissions, is simply in the interests of nobody except the Minister for Finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_1225">I will.  Everything I say relates to emissions and greenhouse gases, etc.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter I have raised some day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">The proposed increase in motor taxation will not work.  The bottom line is that people do not have the money.  The money is not there anymore.  It is wrong for us to meddle in the middle of the year.  People do not know whether they should buy new cars here or in England.  It is difficult to understand why this system is being introduced halfway through the year.  I suspect that the Minister will be challenged by someone in this instance, just as he was in the case of the Ward Union hunt.  I hope common sense will prevail on this occasion, just as it did with the Ward Union hunt.  One cannot simply do away with something that has been there for a long time.  I was glad to see the judgment that was made in the case of the Ward Union hunt earlier this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">It is wrong to try to impose an increase in car tax of 11% or 9.5% on anyone.  I refer in particular to people in rural areas, who depend on their cars to get to work and to make a living.  The Government's VAT and income tax receipts have decreased significantly as a consequence of the decline in the building industry.  We made a mess of the drinks industry when we started to allow cheap drink to be imported from all over the world.  We are losing out as a result of social problems, including bad behaviour, which are caused by people who have bought drink for half nothing.  The same thing will happen in this case if the Minister proceeds with his proposal to increase car tax.  People will travel to Northern Ireland or England.  Such meddling with the system will destroy the whole car industry, of which we are all proud.  Everyone likes to get a new car, regardless of whether it is big or small, just as everyone likes to get a new motorbike or bicycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">It is wrong to meddle with the car industry in the middle of the summer.  This legislation will leave the whole thing open for total destruction.  If these changes were to be introduced on 1 January next, we would think about them.  People would decide not to change their cars until 1 January 2009.  I totally agree with the Minister on those parts of the Bill which are right.  I admire the Green Party's work on certain issues.  However, this plan must have been conceived in the last few minutes before the Cabinet signed off on the budget.  It has not been properly thought out.  There is no sense or reason to these proposals.  This is not the way to reduce emissions from the transport sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">Deputy Mitchell spoke about the public transport system in the greater Dublin area.  I have only been a Deputy for three years, and I am obviously very slow to learn, but I have learned certain things in that time.  I was interested to hear the comments of the four county managers in the greater Dublin area on the transport issue.  They mentioned that bus lanes have been developed from Dunshaughlin and Navan to Dublin.  I will be present at a meeting to be addressed by the Meath county manager next week.  If I travel from Dunshaughlin to Dublin along the N3, it will take 45 minutes longer than it would if I travelled along the M1 or the Ashbourne road.  Very few buses use the bus lane between Dunshaughlin and Dublin.  No Minister is responsible.  We have had no Taoiseach for the past six months.  We have nobody to lead us.  There is nobody to bring the county managers and the officials from Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus and Iarnród Éireann together in one room.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane McEntee</from>
          <p eId="para_1231">I am not straying.  I am talking about the use of the tax system to reduce emissions, which is what the legislation is supposed to be about.  We have been told that the Bill will help the country to get its green areas right.  That is what it is about.  There are no buses on the bus lanes which, according to the Dublin county managers, have been built.  Day in, day out, commuters sit in queues of cars while bus lanes are idle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">Three years ago integrated ticketing was proposed but it was never introduced.  The Government cannot get the stakeholders into a room and nobody has taken responsibility for it, whether that is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister for Transport or the Taoiseach, who has been non-existent for the past six months.  This legislation will not work but we will be subject to the same scene as last week when Government backbenchers, in front of numerous people involved in autism organisations who expected one of them to stand out of the crowd, walked through the lobbies behind the Minister who has absolutely no interest in children who do not have the privilege of having everything 100% right.  They will do the same again later.  As Deputy Tom Hayes rightly said, this is hypocrisy of the highest order.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">The Minister has good ideas and there is no question that we will support them but how can he introduce a taxation measure six months into the year and leave himself open to a court action?  Six months ago he received a great deal of advice regarding the Ward Union issue and it is an absolute mess now.  The Government will be sued and that will also happen with this legislation.  People should sit down and work this out.  If it does not need to be introduced for another six months, why is that not being done?  The measure is not worth talking about because it will not happen.  The sum of €83 million in revenue to which Deputy Noonan referred will not be collected because people do not have money to pay for the increase.  The numbers not paying car tax will increase.  Between 10% and 15% of motorists do not pay insurance or car tax and that will increase to 20%.  The nation's debt has been planted on the people.  The country is up to its ears in debt and we were issued with a good warning about that yesterday.  However, the Government intends to land another tax on people.  The money is not available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">This measure will destroy the car industry, which provides many jobs.  Everybody loves a car but industry sources say this proposal will damage them because people will travel to England and Northern Ireland to buy cars, which will result in more job losses.  I do not know where we are coming from.  There is no sense or meaning to this House for the past six months.  An idea, which looks good on paper, is thrown out and pushed through.  Jobs are being lost left, right and centre throughout the country.  Ministers are busy but I am surprised backbenchers from the Government parties will not stand up and be counted.  They know what is going on in the country and they know it is wrong to increase taxes.  Why have they come into the House to row in behind the Minster like they did last week behind the Minister for Education and Science before going on radio speaking hypocritically?  This measure should be abandoned until 1 January and the Minister should rethink it.  It will be challenged in the courts and if it is introduced, it will destroy the car industry, which we do not want.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_1235">Many Members have said this measure has not been thought through.  It seemed like a good idea in principle but it has emerged following the budget that there are issues which the Minister and the Government did not anticipate. For example, some motorists will unfairly benefit from this measure while there could be a shortfall in local government funding and, as Deputy McEntee said, some people might try to get around the system.  This measure did not need to be rushed.  The Minister has a tendency to say his proposals are a response to climate change and they need to be implemented urgently.  However, measures such as this make little difference to our carbon emissions.  A table was appended to his carbon budget report, which predicted reductions in our emissions over the next five years but no calculation was provided for the VRT and motor taxation changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">This measure assumes our continued dependence on cars and it is part of an approach that will permit a sustained increase in transport emissions.  It will not change people's behaviour but it will allow some people who can afford it to buy different cars from other people.  Its intention is to make them consume one car instead of another.  It does nothing to get people out of their cars to use public transport, thereby reducing transport emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">The Minister needs to learn that he should consult first prior to taking action.  He needs to consult industry and users.</p>

          <p eId="para_1239">There was not enough because the Minister did not anticipate the changes required and he stated earlier other issues need to be examined.  He should consult industry.  The same problem arose regarding his proposal for light bulbs.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_1241">I am not wrong.  The Minister cannot introduce that proposal under EU law by January 2009.  Time will tell but industry is important.  Labour is the party for people's jobs — traditionally we are not the party for industry but even we recognise all stakeholders should be consulted, including the industry.  This proposal should have been examined by the taxation commission.  If the Minister was serious about reducing carbon emissions in the budget, he would have ensured major public transport projects were fast-tracked.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">The easiest project to undertake is investment in Dublin Bus.  I attended a meeting as a councillor in 1999 or 2000 at which the DTO made a presentation on its Platform for  Change.  Its strategy was to invest in Dublin Bus as a short-term measure followed by investment in the existing rail infrastructure and then the Luas and metro.  However, eight years later, none of this has been done.  Dublin Bus is still being held back in the provision of appropriate bus services throughout the city.  This comes down to ideology.  The Government does not want to invest in Dublin Bus, provide additional buses and encourage people out of their cars.  It has dithered about public transport.  Transport 21, environmental impact assessments and so on are not needed to ensure something is done about Dublin Bus.  The Minister should order the buses and commission them.  The Labour Party has proposed the subsidising of fares and the introduction of a €1 bus fare.  Such an initiative would have been given priority if the Green Party and its Government partners were serious about tackling transport emissions.  This legislation will ensure a sustained increase in these emissions.  According to the <i> Irish Independent</i> over Christmas, it is predicted such emissions will be 260% above 1990 levels by 2016 if something is not done about public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">This is about ideology.  The Minister does not need to introduce a Dublin transport authority Bill or to get Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and the RPA together to agree anything.  He should begin with Dublin Bus and give the company the buses it was promised years ago.</p>

        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_476">
          <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
          <p eId="para_1245">I wish to share time with Deputy Naughten.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246">I am happy to contribute on this important motion tabled by the Labour Party.  I compliment the party and others for their work in this area as they have been fighting for people's employment and other rights for a long time.  I compliment a Labour Party member, Anton McCabe, on doing trojan work in exposing unscrupulous employers in my home town of Navan and elsewhere in County Meath.  He deserves recognition as a strong advocate of employees' rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247">I disagree with the Labour Party motion in certain respects but in general I support the need to improve rights of workers, especially those who come from abroad and do not fully understand employment legislation or are afraid to report abuse.  I accept that more information has been made available and, in some instances, SIPTU has translated information into different languages at its own expense.  However, the Government needs to take a more proactive role in encouraging employees of all nationalities to seek help and report issues.  Exploitation and discrimination are not acceptable.  I regularly encounter cases involving employers who bring workers from abroad by offering them accommodation, which is often substandard, transport and money.  The employees think the offer is great but fail to realise they are receiving less than the minimum wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">The Minister spoke about the measures being introduced by the Government and stated that the labour inspectorate will have a full complement of 90 inspectors.  However, that "will" is a long time coming and the full complement is not yet in place.  There are insufficient inspectors to catch all the rogue employers operating in Ireland.  I do not imply that everyone who does agency work is being mistreated but employers are getting away with exploitation in some cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">A number of Deputies asked why the Minister refuses to accept this motion given that his amendment is quite similar.  My interpretation of his response is that he wants to await the commencement of partnership talks so that he can use this as a bargaining tool.  That has happened repeatedly in this House.  During debates on adoptive and maternity leave Bills in the last Dáil, the Minister clearly accepted my arguments and wanted to make changes but he kept saying that we have to wait for the partnership talks.  Who is in charge in this country?  If something is right, it should be done straight away.  We should not wait to hold talks with other groups.  We are repeatedly being told that the Government cannot make decisions before consulting the partners.  That is not good enough because Ministers should make decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">While I support the motion, I have concerns about the suggested six-week timeframe for a temporary worker to become a full-time employee.  I am not convinced this is a practical period of time because, for example, seasonal workers are employed for three and four month periods.  An extension of the period to three or six months might be more acceptable.  However, we cannot accept the practice whereby agency staff work in Government bodies for three or four years on the same pay.  These people are even employed in certain Departments.  A person should be entitled to a full-time job after working two consecutive 12 month terms but I realised when researching the issue that is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">Deputy Penrose referred to countries which had introduced changes.  We could learn from some of these countries, especially those which have implemented collective and sectoral pay agreements.  We need changes and we certainly should ensure that Departments set an example by treating people properly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_477">
          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_1252">Fine Gael endorses the call for legislation to regulate employment agencies and supports this particular motion, subject to the reservations outlined by my colleague, Deputy Varadkar.  I accept that it is not just migrants who are employed as agency workers and that not all agency workers are being exploited.  Many nurses, for example, leave HSE jobs to take up agency work because the salaries are significantly better.  However, people can be exploited and those from foreign countries are more vulnerable to exploitation.  They do not know their basic entitlements or lack the necessary language skills and are afraid to ask questions in case they lose their jobs and are sent home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">I visited the website of the National Employment Rights Authority to find out the information available from it in foreign languages.  It makes information available in a range of languages, including Chinese, Czech, Polish, French and Irish, but it is not very detailed.  Much more needs to be done if we are to properly police this area or ensure migrant workers are given their fair entitlements and can access the basic information they need.  This is further frustrated by the limitation on access to benefits and services for persons who are unlawfully present in the State under the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008.  Section 6 of that Bill seeks to limit access to services such as the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Equality Tribunal.  Access must not be limited on the basis of a person's residency status.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">Last night the Minister made the excuse that he was going to await the commencement of the partnership talks and use this issue as a bargaining tool but he has already broken commitments he made in Towards 2016.  The Government set a target in the partnership agreement to employ 90 labour inspectors by 31 December 2007 to address employment abuses and the underpayment of workers but the National Employment Rights Authority employed just 50 labour inspectors on that date.  It will be summer before the rest of the staff conduct inspections.  It is a damning indictment of this Government's lack of commitment to the issue of labour exploitation that 1,500 fewer inspections were carried out in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">It is important for both Irish people and immigrants that the law is not abused and that immigrants are given the same entitlements as Irish citizens.  There have been countless examples in the construction industry of Irish workers who were replaced by migrant workers at much lower rates.  Some stories, such as the treatment of Gama construction workers from Turkey and the Polish workers at the ESB station in Moneypoint, County Clare, have hit national prominence.  However, under the proposed EU directive providing for sanctions against employers of illegally remaining third country nationals, both the contractor and subcontractor are held jointly liable for the exploitation of workers.  The procedure will start with the person who directly employed them and will then continue up along the line.  The present loophole in the legislation must be closed off.  Currently, a contractor who does not directly employ a worker can wash his or her hands of the situation by claiming the subcontractor employed the exploited individual at below the minimum wage or failed to pay PRSI or proper tax.  In the vast majority of such cases the main contractor knew from the outset the subcontractor could deliver the contract at the price offered without exploiting labour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">It is critical that migrant workers are given legal rights and that their employers do not undercut Irish workers because a dangerous level of resentment is developing which must be stamped out.  The only way that resentment can be effectively eradicated is ensuring the labour inspectorate takes aggressive action by prosecuting directors of such companies.  Notwithstanding the many reputable companies who employ both Irish and migrant employees and abide by our employment laws and wage rates, those who abuse the system must be weeded out.  Unless this problem is addressed, reputable companies will go out of business because they are being undercut by the cowboys within the system.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_478">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_1257">The biblical admonition that labour deserves its wages is one of the most ethical and moral precepts in existence.  Over time, this simple but effective principle has led societies throughout most of the world to develop laws to protect workers' rights.  The process began with the abolition of slavery and continued with the introduction of the minimum wage in America by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938.  Although Ireland introduced the minimum wage at a somewhat later date, I am proud my party was a member of the Government which brought it into being.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">The law in this area is extremely important and Ireland has one of the most progressive minimum wage systems in the world.  The minimum wage is not subject to the whim of the Oireachtas or the Government of the day.  The Minister takes advice in respect of it and regular increases have been forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">Together with the minimum wage legislation, the other laws governing terms of employment, equality and dismissals are, in the main, progressive and pro worker in nature.  Not only does my party have a fantastic track record as regards introducing progressive employment legislation, to be fair, so does the Oireachtas as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">The extensive rights to which I refer apply to agency workers.  As representatives and legislators, we will always do our best to apprise these workers of that fact.  Exploitation is wrong and must be stopped.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to beefing up the inspection system, particularly through the appointment of inspectors with skills in foreign languages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">The social partnership system we have developed is a model of stability and economic progress.  In the early days of new Labour in Britain, social partnership would probably have been considered anathema.  However, our system is a welcome and progressive one.  In Towards 2016, the Government agreed with the social partners to enact key reforms in respect of agency workers.  These relate to licensing, a code of practice and the establishment of a monitoring and advisory committee.  I look forward to the introduction and eventual enactment of the employment agency regulation Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">The Minister outlined to the House and the social partners the Government's position on the proposed EU directive on temporary agency workers.  Further work will be done on this matter at forthcoming Council meetings in the near future.  It is ironic that Ireland is being blamed for delaying the passage of the directive, with which the Minister has issues.  However, in the debate on the Lisbon treaty we are being informed that we have no power in Europe and that everything is being imposed upon us.  Ireland has issues with the directive but I hope progress can be made on it in the near future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_1267">Deputy Naughten referred to the HSE, which uses large numbers of agency workers.  Many nurses and medical staff are happy to engage in agency work, particularly because such work offers them, at least for a period, some level of flexibility.  However, agency work is costing the HSE a great deal of money and it would do well to examine how cost savings might be made in this area.  It could then give pharmacists a break.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">I pay tribute to the Labour Party for raising the issue of migrant workers.  There has been a political controversy in respect of this matter in the north east.  The motion before the House has helped to highlight this issue and I hope it will remind migrant workers that they have rights and should not be exploited.  I also pay tribute to the Minister and the Government on the work they have done in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">In Government, my party has given a warm welcome to workers from all over the world.  I refer, in particular, to those who have arrived from the states that most recently acceded to the European Union.  The welcome given to these workers was extended by our own choice and was not extended by all of our fellow EU member states.  Discrimination against migrant workers in respect of pay or any of their terms and conditions is legally and morally wrong and must be stopped.  As the Minister of State indicated, such workers have the same rights as their Irish counterparts.  That fact must be emphasised at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">Deputies are going to be inundated with queries from migrant workers and perhaps also their agency counterparts.  That will be a positive outcome from this debate.  Obviously, further work must be done in respect of the legislation and hopefully people will come to know more about their rights.  Regardless of whether they are black or white, yellow or brown, labourers deserve equal wages and everyone in the House is in favour of ensuring that they obtain them.</p>

        <speech by="#MJNolan" eId="spk_484">
          <from>Deputy M. J. Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_1271">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to support the Government's amendment.  However, I commend the Labour Party on tabling the motion, which gives Members an opportunity to highlight the difficulties they have experienced in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">Part of the problem is that we would not be experiencing such difficulties were it not for the inordinate success of the economy in the past 20 to 25 years.  None of us would have been exposed to migrant or other foreign workers to the extent we have were it not for the fact that the economy was growing at an average rate of 8% per annum for approximately ten years.  We were not in a position to supply the labour needed to keep the economy going forward at that rate and we were obliged to bring in between 40,000 to 45,000 migrant workers per annum.  Economists state that just to maintain what, by comparison with the previous position, will be relatively low levels of growth in the next two to three years, we will be obliged to bring in between 10,000 to 20,000 workers.  Those people will be very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">It is important to acknowledge that any non-Irish workers employed in the State are entitled to the same protection under legislation as their Irish counterparts.  As previous speakers indicated, the major difficulties arise in labour-intensive industries such as agriculture and aquaculture and in the services sector.  There are those who say that because many of the foreign workers employed in these areas do not have full command of the English language, unscrupulous employers tend to take advantage of them.  It is in that context I urge the Minister to fast-track the introduction of the employment agency regulation Bill.  I am aware that it has not yet gone to Cabinet but the Minister must ensure that the introduction of this much needed and probably overdue legislation be fast-tracked.  I hope the Bill might pass all Stages in both Houses by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">Abuses relating to migrant workers have been highlighted in the past five years.  I refer, in particular, to two cases involving non-Irish workers who seem to have been employed on contracts and at rates of pay that were not the same as those enjoyed by their Irish counterparts.  There are those who claim that it is in the interests of the agencies involved to have some of these workers being paid at such rates.  Others would say that it was for tax reasons that they were being paid in such a manner and that some of the payments came under the radar of the tax authorities.  For whatever reason, it is important that we should close off whatever loopholes exist.  Irish and non-Irish workers should be paid the same rates and enjoy the same conditions of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">As a result of the slowdown in the economy, an element of competition has entered the workplace.  This is particularly the case in the building sector, where competition has arisen between Irish and non-Irish workers.  It is unfortunate that this has happened.  There is a large population of non-Irish families and workers in the country.  I would be sorry to see a situation develop in which there would be competition between those on both sides.  It would be wrong for those on one side to accuse those on the other of undercutting them by reducing prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">A number of non-Irish workers have claimed that the Department only provides information in the English language and that they cannot understand it.  I commend the unions for taking part in the debate on this issue and for ensuring that workers, be they Irish or non-Irish, are catered for and will have someone to make the case on their behalf.  The extraordinary changes which have taken place are part of the problem we have.  The Government and the Irish people are to be commended for the welcoming approach they have given to non-Irish workers in so far as we were one of the few countries that accepted Polish workers when they acceded to the European Union some years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">I commend the Minister of State on what is being done but ask him to bring forward the promised legislation earlier rather than later.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryWhite" eId="spk_485">
          <from>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</from>
          <p eId="para_1278">I welcome this debate as parties to the Towards 2016 commence the formal review of the agreement, which provides for opportunities to re-focus and re-prioritise the overall goals of the agreement in a much changed Irish labour landscape in which one in eight workers is a migrant.  It also comes in the context of continuing efforts at European Union level to standardise the work environment to bring about parity in pay and employment conditions between agency and non-agency workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">I will address several aspects of the amendment to the motion moved by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  It is very important all sides of the House recognise the good work performed by the National Employment Rights Authority, based in my home county town of Carlow, and that the Government's promise to put it on a statutory footing is a very positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">In 2007 the National Employment Rights Authority conducted 14,000 inspections and took 93,000 calls regarding issues of employment rights and employer responsibilities in the area of the minimum wage and protecting young workers, particularly in the construction sector.  That is an impressive workload by anyone's standards.  The body also recovered €2.5 million in wage arrears for the workers in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">This agency is working hard, having announced recently its next targeted sectoral campaign in the security industry.  The Government announced in January a very extensive advertising and information campaign through all forms of the media, with which they hope to gain the attention of approximately 85% of our population so that workers can know their rights and entitlements.  I have heard those advertisements, which are extremely good and informative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">Much good work has been done on improving the protection of workers, and the many social partners acknowledge that with us in the House.  The employment agency regulation Bill is a little more complicated.  There can be naked exploitation of migrant workers through employment agencies but the Bill looks to tie down in legislation equality for these workers, as is desired by all sides in the EU directive on temporary agency work that must provide for a level playing field for employers throughout the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">There is a danger in Ireland that we could go from insufficient protection of agency workers to being exposed because of derogations in the said directive for collective agreements.  For those of us interested, article 5.3 outlines that very succinctly.  Article 5.4 of the proposed directive is a derogation from equal treatment in respect of short-term temporary agency assignments of a maximum of six weeks.  Many people feel this timespan is far too short.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">As other speakers have outlined, flexibility and recognition of certain labour market realities, such as seasonal workers, particularly in the fruit and vegetable and aquaculture sector, must be recognised in any agreed directive.  I am sure that will be progressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">The employment agency regulation Bill of 2008 will modernise the regulation of the employment agency and I welcome that as a very positive move for employees.  We will have a greater system of licensing for agencies, a statutory code of practice which they must follow and a monitoring committee comprised of representatives of the social partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">I welcome other aspects of this Bill aimed at strengthening and enhancing the directive and the enforcement of employment rights of agency workers.  I welcome the statutory footing of the National Employment Rights Authority and the new employment agency regulation Bill.  I look forward to a carefully balanced European Union directive on agency workers' rights.  It is fitting we should strive for the aspirations of the 1916 Proclamation to be fulfilled, "equal rights and equal opportunities to all citizens".  In Ireland we have the opportunity to secure that as we review Towards 2016.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnCurranFF" eId="spk_487">
          <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_1288">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  At the outset I compliment both Sinn Féin and Labour for putting down the motion.  In some respects it is a pity we will have to vote on the motion as the issue is fundamentally important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">Considering what has happened in Ireland in the past decade, we have seen significant growth in the economy and virtually full employment.  We have also seen a big demand for workers.  That rate of growth will not be repeated over the next decade so we now stand at a crossroads.  The decisions we make and implement now do not just have historical significance — we reflect the issues as they have arisen — but they will also indicate how we will manage the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">Agency workers are not just confined to the hotel and construction sectors, as highlighted in the motion.  They are employed right across the economy in areas such as accounting, information technology, pharmaceuticals, secretarial and health services.  I personally know people who for one reason or another have left permanent employment to take up agency work.  This may be a result of the degree of flexibility offered etc.  In some particular areas, agency work has proven to be very effective and some — not all — have opted for it.  There are some areas that have difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">Provisional figures indicate about 2% of the workforce in Ireland are engaged in agency work.  This is a significant number of people and considering there are 2 million in the workforce, it comes to approximately 40,000 people.  In relative terms the figure is low but it is important agency workers are protected in the workplace by employment law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">Agency workers are entitled to decent and fair standards of employment.  It should be noted that in the past ten years, employment rights have been extended to cover the protection of working conditions of temporary workers.  By extension, that includes agency workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">I appreciate that many agency workers may and do feel vulnerable in their employment.  They may feel employment law does not apply to them and they may be fired and hired at will.  They may feel they can be paid any rate with no regard for the minimum wage.  They may be afraid to complain.  We pass legislation in this House to address those fears.  However, without adequate monitoring we can pass all the legislation we want and not achieve the results we desire.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">In the 15-year period from 1991 to 2006, the workforce of the country doubled from approximately 1 million to 2 million people.  Importantly, the dynamic of the workforce changed radically at the same time.  Women returned to the workforce in greater numbers and migrant workers made up a growing percentage of it.  Part-time and agency work became a growing feature of the workforce, as did subcontracting and so-called self-employed subcontractors.  What did not keep pace with the radical change in the workforce was the number of labour inspectors.  I am pleased that in this regard, the National Employment Rights Authority is now up and running.  When it has its full complement, it will have 90 labour inspectors.  Reflecting the times we are living in, ten of the inspectors will have specific foreign language skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">From time to time we hear stories suggesting unfair or improper treatment of all workers, not just those of the agency kind.  Rather than repeat these stories for a headline, any of us with such information should pass on such complaints to the National Employment Rights Authority.  They should be investigated thoroughly and the appropriate sanctions taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">Agency and part-time work is here to stay, as it is a necessary feature of the diverse work practices necessary to sustain our economy.  We should not take employment creation for granted as we must work at it.  In the challenging economic times we face, we should redouble our efforts in that regard.  We must be conscious of the needs and requirements of employers and recognise the varying degrees of flexibility required in some sectors.  While recognising the requirements we must meet our obligations and protect the rights of agency and part-time workers.  I welcome the fact that the Government is committed to the early delivery of further primary legislation aimed at enhanced compliance with employment rights generally and including legislation to regulate the operation of employment agencies and the statutory code of practice for employment agencies.  The previous legislation on this goes back to the early 1970s.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kelleher, said last night that he and the Minister, Deputy Martin, are considering the final elements of the proposals for the draft scheme of a Bill to regulate the employment agency sector.  It will be presented for the Government's consideration soon.  Some might argue we have waited too long for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher is here because often the relevant Minister is not present in the Chamber.  I spoke recently to representatives of SIPTU in my constituency who are concerned about the replacement of existing workers, with part-time, agency or other workers.  We did not discuss specific cases but they need not have come to my office to say this because in a constituency such as mine many are employed as labourers, particularly in the building industry where activity has declined significantly.  The fears of the SIPTU representatives echo those that individual constituents had brought to my office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">We must pay attention to the displacement of workers when net employment this year will grow by 500 jobs per week compared with 1,000 or 1,500 per week in previous years.  I have spoken about this in private with the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  This issue was less significant before now but as economic growth slows the Minister of State should be warned that we are seeing it trickle through and as a Government we need to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">While I raised concerns regarding safeguards for agency workers, I wish to acknowledge the significant legislative changes of the past decade.  The proposed new legislation that the Minister of State outlined last night, the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority, with the provision of 90 labour inspectors, are welcome developments, and on that basis I support the Government's amendment tonight.</p>

        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_488">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1301">I am thankful for the opportunity to speak here and contribute to this debate.  It is important to mention some facts about integration.  I appreciate that the focus tonight is on workers' rights but in the case of migrant workers we must also deal with family and other related issues.  The number of non-Irish people living here stands at 10% of the population according to the official census figures of last year but the Central Statistics Office was quick to point out before Christmas last that this is an underestimate of the population which could be anything between 12% and 15%.  We must devise a system that can respond to the needs of migrant workers and put them to good effect to develop our labour market and the productive capacity of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">Half a million of the people living in Ireland today were not born here.  That is a higher percentage by a considerable margin than is the case for the United States, the United Kingdom or France which have a much greater history of inward migration than we do.  It is a tribute to the people who have migrated here and to those already living here that we have not experienced some of the problems evident in other European countries despite the short time of ten years within which migration has occurred here.  We welcome people and value their contribution to life here in every sense, economic, social and cultural.  We have an obligation to assist people to integrate into society not just because they contribute to the labour force but also because migration and how countries manage migration is and will be a defining way to manage social stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">It is not often acknowledged in this House that social stability, through the partnership process created by Mr. Charles Haughey in 1987, has been the anchor for recent Irish prosperity.  It has defined our success.  Many have concentrated on other issues such as tax cuts but the partnership process has guaranteed rights, put minimum wage legislation in place and guaranteed, protected and developed a culture of developing the rights of workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">We have an obligation to assist people to integrate within Irish life not just for moral reasons but for productive and capacity reasons such as improving the capacity of our trained workforce. The establishment of the National Employment Rights Agency is important for Irish and non-Irish workers alike.  The agency has employed ten people with foreign language skills, an appropriate and proper response by such an agency to the diverse nature of our workforce and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">I am sure I was not the only Member to be shocked by reports of recent cases of exploitation of vulnerable workers.  The only consolation anyone can take from these cases is that the system came to the assistance of the injured party.  Hopefully the new agency will be better equipped to detect and deter further wrongdoing.  I join my colleagues in urging anyone who suspects exploitation of workers to report their suspicions to this new agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">The implementation of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will also assist vulnerable migrant workers.  It is important that people see the positive side of this Bill which is going through both Houses.  It will provide for permanent residence in Ireland, giving migrants every entitlement short of voting in general elections and availing of consular services when abroad.  All other entitlements enjoyed by citizens will flow to those who have long-term residence here.  The Bill is a ground-breaking attempt to deal with what will be a defining feature of Irish life for the next ten to 30 years, inward migration due to affluence and our improving economy and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">The establishment of my office for integration to co-ordinate the actions of Departments and other service providers will help the vulnerable migrant worker.  One of the best ways to improve life for migrant workers is to improve their language skills.  In primary and post-primary schools we employ more than 1,900 language support teachers, compared with 262 in the school year of 2001-2.  That is a significant jump over a short period.  The Department of Education and Science provides this service at a cost of the order of €120 million a year.  The Department and my office are also addressing those who are beyond school-leaving age.  Many VECs already provide English language classes and public libraries do valuable work, for instance, the work of Dublin Corporation through the ILAC library.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">More needs to be done in this area and my office and the Department of Education and Science have engaged independent consultants to review the area to help the development of policy and the delivery of language classes to adult migrants.  The estimated demand for English language learning is four times the supply.  There is a major challenge to ramp up the level of service provision, to allow the many migrants to make an even greater contribution to our productive capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">According to the CSO data the profile of the migrants is distinctly different from that which has obtained traditionally in large European countries.  They are predominantly from central and eastern Europe, of Judeo-Christian background, half are Catholic, in the key working age demographic, 28 to 44, and are overqualified for the jobs they do.  Therein lies the challenge for this Government, and I suspect everybody in the House, of how to develop the productive capacity of those who are overqualified for the type of jobs they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">We must break down the barriers that prevent them from progressing within our society and in so doing, even from a self-interested, economic and rather narrow perspective, we can improve the productive capacity of our economy and society.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_489">
          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1311">With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's approval, I wish to share time with Deputies Kathleen Lynch, Martin Ferris and Aengus Ó Snodaigh.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">This is a particularly important motion that deals with the plight of temporary agency workers.  I believe this motion essentially is about greed and exploitation.  It is about the trafficking of migrant workers and the exploitation of Irish workers.  It is about modern day slavery, as Jack O'Connor, president of SIPTU, stated when he recently described the burgeoning practice of employing agency workers, particularly in the construction and catering industries, the services industry and seasonal work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">Ireland has aided and abetted this practice and abuse for more than a decade.  Tens of thousands of workers from eastern Europe have been recruited by employment agencies within and without Ireland.  By 2006, an estimated 30,000 such workers had been recruited to work in Ireland through more than 500 employment agencies.  I believe the figure is much higher and although anecdotally this appears to be the case, no proper Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures are available and no labour force survey has been carried out.  The Minister stated last night that he was about to conduct a labour force survey, which would provide a more true version of the real position.  Moreover, the Minister of State with responsibility for integration policy has just told Members that effectively, the CSO figures are guesstimates.  In other words, the figures in respect of migrant workers, immigration and the families of migrant workers and immigrants are far higher than the CSO figures with which Members have been supplied.  The inability of the Minister for Education and Science to make provision for primary school places also indicates that this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">Agency workers have no job security, no access to sick pay or pension entitlements or to other non-pay benefits.  Their rates of pay invariably are much lower than those enjoyed by the direct workforce.  They are subject to exploitation as a pool of cheap labour.  However, exploitation of agency workers is not only a problem for the workers concerned as it also poses a serious threat to the rest of the permanent workforce, whose pay and conditions of employment can, and eventually will, be undermined by the unregulated use of agency workers.  It depresses pay for all and facilitates the race to the bottom.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">The Government, regardless of its protestations, has stubbornly refused to introduce necessary legislation to have employment agencies licensed in Ireland, to regulate the practice of recruitment and placement of agency workers or to provide for equal treatment in respect of pay, conditions and employment status of agency workers.  I believe it suits certain sections of the business community to have a large pool of unprotected migrant and Irish workers recruited on the basis of temporary agency employment instead of permanent employment.  It provides maximum flexibility with the minimum of security and constitutes a capitalist seventh heaven.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">I refer to an article that appears in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> by Brendan McGinty, the director of industrial relations and human resources at the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC.  Both the text and the article’s heading, which states “Flexible labour market crucial to economy”, are interesting.  The article is peppered with the words “flexible” and “flexibility”.  However, there is no mention of security.  Mr. McGinty is talking about a flexible labour market without reference to security for the worker, which is what is most lacking at present.  The article’s sub-heading states: “Restricting employers from using temporary workers serves no one’s interest.”  While this is true, no one advocates restricting employers from using temporary workers.  I advocate regulation, licensing, equal treatment and rights.  I am not talking about restrictions.  I recognise that fine employment is provided by agencies to agency workers in sectors such as information technology, nursing and so on.  However, there are whole swathes of vulnerable areas in which there is now a burgeoning industry in agency workers, about which I am concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">In 2002, the European Commission, recognising that abuse was taking place, decided to regulate agency workers to prevent such abuse.  Consequently, more than five years ago, the much-maligned European Commission drew up the draft directive on temporary agency workers, which provided for a qualifying period or "a grace period" of six weeks before the principle of equal treatment would come into operation.  Ireland, Britain and a third member state have opposed that directive for the past six years, thereby depriving temporary workers of rights in the workplace, creating an inferior category of worker, depressing pay levels and replacing direct employment and a permanent workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">Incidentally, the Minister of State might be interested to learn that Article 15 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Lisbon treaty goes a long way towards outlawing the current exploitation of agency workers.  Subsection 3 states: "Nationals of third countries who are authorised to work in the territories of the Member States are entitled to working conditions equivalent to those of the citizens of the Union."  Clearly, it would be very difficult for this Government to deny equal treatment for equal work once the Lisbon reform treaty is in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">The Irish trade union movement has long campaigned for a fair and equitable solution to the current iniquitous situation.  It has experienced many cases of abuse taking place in respect of agency workers, particularly in the construction and catering industries, in the services industry and among seasonal workers.  As talks begin on a new social partnership agreement, the Government should do the honourable thing.  It should draw up the necessary legislation in consultation with the trade union movement.  I welcome the promise made last night — at least this debate elicited that commitment — for new primary legislation to replace the outdated Employment Agency Act 1971 and to provide for a proper inspectorate and code of practice.  This should be passed by the Oireachtas before the ratification of the Lisbon reform treaty and before the new talks on social partnership are completed.  For too often in the past, Irish people, and Irish workers in particular, have been obliged to wait for the European Union to vindicate their rights when successive Governments have refused or have been negligent in so doing.  Were the Government truly committed to social partnership, it now would seize the initiative while it can.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">The Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, is probably aware that an employment Council of Ministers meeting will be held on 29 February.  Another will not take place until the end of June, which is a long time away.  Were the Minister to give a commitment that he will proactively raise the issue of agency workers at that meeting, it would be most welcome.  He attended the last meeting and I expect he will attend the next one.  He should indicate that the Government is withdrawing its opposition to the European Union directive on agency workers.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1321">I congratulate Deputy Willie Penrose on tabling this motion.  Although that might appear somewhat hollow as he is my party colleague, it is important nevertheless.  For as long as I have known Deputy Penrose, he always has been a strong and highly vocal supporter of the underdog.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">History will judge us harshly.  When the Celtic tiger first started to roar, there were no agency workers in Ireland.  The circumstances that led to the boom in Ireland's economy were not achieved with the help of agency workers, shoddy practices or lack of protection for workers.  I know someone with lifelong involvement in the labour movement who often makes the point that protection for workers in Ireland 20 years ago was better than is the case at present.  For example, if one entered employment 20 years ago, one was guaranteed a pension.  Twenty years ago, when one took up employment one was told one's rights and that one should join a union that would protect one, but those protections no longer exist.  Twenty years ago, the current Taoiseach told us he would introduce a Bill that would ensure workers would be protected and would have the right to join unions.  We are now building our economy and its wealth on the backs of others, which is despicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">I know people who worked in England in the 1950s for no more than five or six years and the pensions department contacted them and told them that, as a result of their having done so, they are entitled to a pension, albeit small.  I refer to the old enemy across the way that we often blame for all our woes.  However, it treated us with respect and decency when we went there to work, which is all we ask in respect of those who come to Ireland to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">There are 600 recruitment agencies in Ireland, which has a population of 4 million.  Poland, which has a population of 40 million, has 700 such agencies.  One may ask whether the agencies in Ireland are here for the good of their health or because they know we need them.  They are here because they know there is money to be made and people to be exploited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, speak about integration.  I live in Blackpool, which has a large number of foreign workers, many of whom are from eastern Europe.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, knows the area well and will know there is no integration and that immigrants come and go.  If one says "hello" to them on the street, they will reply, but there is no integration because they do not feel welcome or wanted and they know they are being exploited.  They will not stay in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">The home countries of immigrants have infrastructure that we do not yet have and they had it before they joined the European Union.  As soon as these countries get up off their knees, their emigrants will return home.  If we do not start looking after them, it will undermine the protections our workers should enjoy.  We should start telling Irish workers to look out for their fellow employees because as long as their employers get away with exploiting other workers, it puts their own jobs in jeopardy.  This undercuts the wage structure and protections for Irish workers.  It is not fair on good employers and they should not have to compete with others who are clearly not paying the same salaries or affording the same protections.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">When the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, goes to the meeting of the Council of Ministers, he will have to tell the attendees that Ireland withdraws its objection.  Objecting is not becoming of us as a nation whose citizens went everywhere, built economies abroad and were treated fairly and decently when doing so.  There was no Irish man or woman in England who was paid less than the English citizen with whom he or she worked side by side.  It just did not happen and they were afforded the same protections.  If there was exploitation, it was usually by our own.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">It does not serve us well to allow people to be exploited.  We should prevent it because we can.  We will need our economic migrants in the future and this need will be far greater than their need for us.  Whenever I consider such matters, I first ask myself how I would feel if I, my daughter, son or sister were exploited.  I know the answer: I would not like it, I would feel abused and used.  The people to whom I refer feel they do not have the right to protest.  They are not here because they love us or for the scenery, and God knows they are not here for the weather, they are here because they do not have a choice.  It is immoral to exploit someone in such circumstances.  We should not be surprised by it but we really need to ensure it does not continue.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_491">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_1329">It is clear that those who warned about the consequences of the last enlargement of the European Union, as outlined in the Nice treaty with regard to what the promised "mobility of capital and labour" would mean, were correct.  It means there are now fewer restrictions on employers in that they can either move their enterprise to another country or gain access to cheap labour from other EU states.  As Sinn Féin and others warned at the time of ratification of the treaty, the process was designed to facilitate a race to the bottom in which conditions for workers, hard won by trade union movements, would be undermined by the employment of people earning less than the norm and, in many cases, without the traditional protections that workers in more developed states enjoyed in regard to labour legislation and union membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330">The case of Irish Ferries probably best encapsulated the kinds of forces that were at work and the motivations of many employers in trumpeting the benefits of European enlargement.  The same incentives lie behind the support of most employers for the reform treaty.  It is rightly seen as a further loosening of national sovereignty and social control on capital that gives big business even greater freedom at the expense of workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">It is interesting, therefore, that more and more trade unionists are realising that issues such as those under discussion are intimately connected with the loosening of control.  ICTU declared only last week that it might oppose the proposed treaty because of the issue of agency workers and the growing feeling on the part of trade union members here that the downward pressure on wages and job displacement are intimately connected to enlargement in the interest of big business.  IBEC has no doubt that this is the case and will once again mobilise its considerable resources in support of the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">The issue of job displacement has been brought to my attention on a number of occasions.  I was approached a year ago by workers in a factory in Tralee who became aware that not only had the company they worked for advertised for new staff exclusively through an agency in Poland but that the workers who were employed subsequently were earning less than them.  They did not join the trade union of which the local workers were members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">When I pursued this through questions to the Minister, I was informed that the employer in question had not broken any law as he was entitled to advertise anywhere within the European Union and was under no obligation to advertise the jobs locally.  The serious aspect of this matter is that local people had submitted <i>curricula vitae </i>and had done interviews for vacancies that had arisen previously and were not even notified thereafter.  Since advertisements for the jobs in question appeared only in agencies in Poland, local workers could not apply for the positions that became available.  That this could occur while the existing workforce was unaware of the conditions under which the Polish workers were employed illustrates the abuse to which the recruitment of staff through agencies can lead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">Such practices have taken place in many locations around the country.  There have even been cases of entire workforces being laid off and replaced by non-Irish workers employed through agencies.  One such example, which came to light because the workforce was unionised, involved Doyle Concrete in Kildare where 16 members of SIPTU were sacked and replaced by lower paid non-national workers.  This came to light because SIPTU was involved, but displacement and attacks on wages and conditions generally escape national attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">We are all familiar with sectors, such as those involving hotels, bars, catering and cleaning, in which the Irish worker traditionally employed has to a large extent disappeared.  The impact of displacement in these sectors has perhaps been somewhat obscured by the fact the jobs in question were often taken by middle-aged women or students on a part-time basis.  The income earned was crucial, particularly for many working-class households.  Now workers in those sectors are almost invariably non-national workers employed through contract agencies.  One wonders what is the economic incentive for employers in replacing one relatively low paid and poorly protected group of workers with a group of workers who are even more vulnerable.  One of the concerns expressed by the union members in Tralee at that time was that the agency workers employed there refused to tell them how much they were being paid.  Obviously this was done on the instructions of the employer and it raised suspicions about their being paid less than the prevailing rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">Anyone who suggested that employers may be employing people at such low rates, or even below the minimum wage, have been scoffed at as if there was no question that any person with money here might evade legislation designed to ensure he or she abides by proper standards.  Unfortunately, such fears were confirmed by figures recently released which showed that in 2006 and 2007, 296 cases of employers paying below the minimum wage were detected, but only one prosecution was taken.  That is hardly a major deterrent for unscrupulous employers willing to access cheap labour through agencies.  It is also likely, given the relative lack of inspectors available to monitor adherence to wage legislation, that the above figures represent a gross underestimate of the scale of abuse involved.  It is clear the type of legislation proposed in this motion is urgently required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337">Further proof of that, if it was needed, was provided by a comment made last night at a meeting of Louth County Council by the chairperson who claimed that non-Irish workers should be paid less for doing the same job.  He was responding to a Sinn Féin motion on the same issue under discussion here.  Furthermore, this man is an employer.  Irish people who were forced to emigrate from this State during the past 100 years worked for similar employers who unscrupulously exploited their labour to the extent that some workers here are currently being exploited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">This legislation needs to be put through.  The Government will be as guilty as unscrupulous employers unless it proactively pursues legislation that protects the rights of workers and, thus, workers from being exploited.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_492">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_1339">Is maith an rud é go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar an ábhar seo.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí Morgan agus Penrose, a chuir an rún seo os ár gcomhair.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">The primary focus of this debate is on the need for urgent legislation to end the abuse of agency workers.  It is about getting a seemingly oblivious Government to understand the urgency attached to this matter.  It is also about getting it to appreciate the impact of the current position on ordinary workers whose standards of living are being gravely undermined by the lack of legislation for which we are calling in this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">The assertions made by Ministers last night that they are committed to decent standards of employment ring very hollow while at the same time they are attempting to downplay this serious issue and minimise the extent of the problems related to it.  The Government and employers' representatives have so far refused to go beyond legislating for what are mainly procedural issues about the organisation and operation of the agencies.  Both the Government and employers try to convince us that working as an agency worker is a lifestyle choice for these workers when the opposite is the case.  Most of these workers would prefer a permanent contract and have little choice but to work as temporary agency workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342">I was astounded to hear the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs raise some doubts about what the unions have been saying.  He said there were "strong assertion from trade unions that agency workers are being used increasingly to undermine basic. . .standards".  As to whether they are true, those are the doubts he raised.  The Minister of State is clearly not doing his job if he is unaware of the plethora of specific cases that have been highlighted by a range of unions.  The Government, as its amendment suggests and any reading of it would confirm, is in denial about the abuse of agency workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">Last night the Minister, Deputy Martin, said "it is too broad a generalisation to equate agency workers with migrant workers".  He is correct, but it is grossly misleading to suggest that this is what we, in Opposition, or the trade unions, have been saying.  We have been clear in saying this is an issue for all workers, with more Irish workers finding themselves faced with little prospect but to accept employment as an agency worker because no legislation on this area has been introduced since 1971.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">The contributions of senior and junior Ministers to the debate last night confirmed what Sinn Féin has long argued, that protecting and defending workers' rights is not a priority for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We are being asked to bring forward cases of exploitation yet only one employer has been prosecuted for failing to pay the minimum wage.  Almost 300 have been found guilty of this practice over the past two years but have not been prosecuted.  Clearly, exploitative employers are not being held to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">Again, and against all international evidence, the issue of competitiveness was cited by the Minister, Deputy Martin, as a stumbling block to the legislation that is needed for workers, if current standards of living are to be protected.  The message must be that we can have both competitiveness and strong protections of workers' rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">In 2005, tens of thousands of people who supported workers took to the streets to protest at Irish Ferries' plans to replace its employees with workers supplied by an offshore employment agency.  Irish Ferries wanted to pay rates substantially less than the minimum wage and the public were rightly outraged by that.  The dispute occurred within six months of the Gama Construction scandal, which revealed what was happening to Turkish workers employed here through another offshore employment agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">Ghlac an Rialtas aréir agus roimhe go bhfuil gá le athrú iomlán a dhéanamh ar an Employment Agency Act 1971.  Níl an Rialtas tar éis a rá linn nó le éinne eile, nó a léiriú trí aon moladh a chuir chun tosaigh, cad a bheidh sa reachtaíocht.  Tá buairt orainn, ón méid a bhí le rá aréir agus roimhe sin, nach mbeidh aon fiúntas sa reachtaíocht má thagann sé ón Rialtas seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348">The Government has known for years about the problems that have developed around agency workers, yet it has done nothing to legislate to protect them or address the position of agency workers being used to casualise work places and depress wages.  The Government has not, as it claimed last night, adopted a constructive approach to the proposed EU directive on agency workers.  Yet it is important to emphasise that this State does not have to wait for that directive to be agreed, it can legislate now.  That is for what this motion calls.  It can legislate for the equal treatment principle.  Equality already applies in Ireland in respect of fixed-term workers and part-time workers.  It is not, or at least it should not be, a huge step to develop legal provisions that would provide that agency workers be guaranteed equal treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">I will summarise what we are seeking and what our motion contains.  We seek legislation that provides for agency workers to be entitled to pay parity; that allows for the entitlements and conditions of their directly employed co-workers, such as sick days, holiday leave, protection from dismissal and company benefits; and that allows for trade union membership.  We need legislation that prohibits the use of agency workers in certain situations, that is, to replace workers on strike; and that makes the agency and the user company jointly responsible and liable so workers can ensure enforcement of their rights.  Such legislation must prohibit agencies from charging the employee for an aspect of their recruitment or placement process and prohibit unfair discriminating "profiling" practices.  We need legislation that makes it an offence for employers to use unlicensed agencies and requires an agency operating in Ireland, where it may be based, to be compliant not only with the law in Ireland but European law, whichever is the highest standard.  We seek legislation that will increase sanctions on employers who ignore workers' rights and improve redress for the workers concerned.  Also, it must place restrictions on the number of times employers can fill a post with an agency worker before he or she becomes permanent.  How many agencies are contracted to supply workers to the State sector to overcome the public service embargo?  That is a question for the Minister of State.  How many agency workers work for the State, and why not grant them permanent contracts?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Michael Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1350">I open my remarks by saying that the Government side has listened carefully to the useful and important contributions on temporary agency workers, from various sides, both last night and this evening.  Contrary to the common assertion from most Opposition Deputies during last night's debate, this Government is deeply committed to decent standards of employment, and that these should also apply to temporary agency workers.  Significant and substantial measures have been taken over the past ten years to underpin employment standards, including the introduction of the national minimum wage, which is currently at a level in Ireland that is among the highest in the European Union, and which applies to temporary agency workers.  This is backed up with strong employment rights enforcement through the full redress mechanisms of the State.  Our colleagues in the benches opposite have noted the contributions from the Government side with particular reference to the protection already afforded to agency workers by existing employment law and to the fact that commitments entered into by Government in the context of the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, will shortly be reflected in new legislative proposals now being finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">In considering the contributions to the debate, I have been struck by the apparent belief in some quarters that Irish society and employment law does not provide any rights or protection for agency workers — with particular reference to agency workers from overseas.  This perception was most surprising as the laws in question have been enacted in this House.  Lest there be any doubt, I reiterate that the full range of Irish employment legislation applies to agency workers and others from abroad posted to Ireland temporarily by their foreign based employers.  This Government would not tolerate the emergence of a two-tier system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">Having regard to the large corpus of legislation already in place, it is undoubtedly true that the rapidly changing economy and steady evolution of new working relationships has increased the potential for abuse of work practices and for exploitation of those not aware of their rights, or how to vindicate them.  The Government's response to this reality has been to avail of the social partnership process — to agree with the social partners a new framework to bring about greater compliance with employment law and provide the administrative means to give effect to these commitments.  Already the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, has started work, with a significant increase in staff and a regional structure.  A new Bill to give effect to the new compliance model is being finalised.  NERA's mission is to achieve a national culture of employment rights compliance.  One of the ways it aims to achieve this mission is by providing information on employment rights and obligations to employees and employers in a factual and impartial manner.  The effect of this should not be underestimated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">In the light of recent public comments it is worth noting that very few cases of abuse of agency workers have been brought to NERA's attention.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal has also seen very few agency cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_1355">The rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission has only seen a handful of cases each year involving agency personnel.  I am sure that Deputies will agree this pattern is very much at odds with the situation as represented in public debate in recent months.  A clear message from the debate this evening must be that the very considerable resources put in place by this House should be used, when necessary, for the greatest effect.  I suggest to Deputies that the House can be proud of its response to challenges encountered in the area of employment rights and employment law compliance.  The work, of course, is not finished and the House will before long have the opportunity to consider proposals included in the forthcoming employment law compliance Bill and the employment agency regulation Bill, which will replace legislation from 1971 and meet the Government's commitment to new legislation set out in the social partnership agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">I must reject the Opposition contention that the position adopted by Ireland in EU negotiations to date on the proposed directive on temporary agency work is misplaced.  In our negotiations in Brussels we have not been seeking a special position for Ireland.  We are simply seeking balance in this important European instrument which respects the rights of employees and employers alike, and the different legal and industrial frameworks and traditions in Europe.  I suggest to Deputies there is no benefit to Ireland in putting ourselves at a disadvantage to our continental counterparts in this area.  This will do nothing to safeguard jobs and grow employment and is certainly not beneficial in the current challenging economic climate.  I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_1357">I am sharing time with Deputy Gilmore, with the permission of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358">On behalf of Sinn Féin I want to thank everyone who has participated in this debate, particularly those who have spoken in support of the motion, who will vote for it here this evening.  This is an historic motion and debate, as it is the first such jointly tabled by the Labour Party and Sinn Féin in the Oireachtas.  More important, it is a statement of intent that exploitation will not be tolerated.  It is an act of solidarity with those workers who are being abused and the trade union movement which represents them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">The Government has refused to acknowledge the gravity of the issue we are raising.  It has refused to accept the extent of the problems, despite mounting evidence and the specific testimonies gathered by the trade union movement.  When Ministers exhibit such ignorance of the issue, is it any wonder it is not being dealt with?  The Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, in particular, has attempted to confuse the issue and give the misleading impression that agency workers have access to rights and entitlements, which they clearly do not.  The Minister of State tried to sow further confusion by stating last evening that migrant workers have the same protection in legislation as Irish nationals.  That is not the issue.  Agency workers, whatever their nationality, are being denied the full protection of labour law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, has no evidence that the exploitation of agency workers is precipitating a race to the bottom in terms of pay and conditions.  I can only ask what planet they are all living on because this is happening all over Ireland, and sadly, all over Europe.  The trade union movement is united in demanding that the Government legislates for the principle of equal treatment of agency workers.  Outside the Dáil, the leaders of the largest unions in the country, including SIPTU, Unite, IMPACT and Mandate, gathered to demand that Government Deputies demonstrate their concern for workers' rights by supporting this motion from Sinn Féin and the Labour Party.  These unions and their members have identified a significant growth in the use of employment agencies across the economy, particularly in unskilled and low skilled sectors.  All the evidence suggests that the 2% figure which the Minister quoted as the percentage of the workforce who are agency workers, is a serious underestimation.  These figures are a number of years out of date.  It is likely that there has been an increase similar to that in Britain, where the TUC did a report in 2006 which found that the figures in Britain had risen from 2.6% in 2002 to 5% in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">Exploitation of agency workers is a particular problem in the construction sector, in hotels and services, retail distribution, transport and logistics, food processing and the meat and mushroom sectors.  However, I want to put on record this evening my welcome of the recent initiative by Monaghan Mushrooms that deserves to be both recognised and applauded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">The Minister asks where is the evidence.  In 2002 a report from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions found that temporary agency workers earned only 68% of the wages of their directly employed colleagues.  They had less entitlement and control over the work they do than directly employed counterparts.  This is not about the country of origin of workers, it must be emphasised.  It is about agency workers versus directly employed workers, full stop, end of story.  That was clearly missed by the Minister of State's contribution last evening and that of the Minister, Deputy Martin. as clearly evidenced in the amendment tabled to the motion jointly presented by Labour and Sinn Féin for discussion.   The Government cannot, in all seriousness, expect the trade union movement to enter a new round of social partnership negotiations while this issue remains unaddressed nor should unions be forced to bargain in order to have this issue addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">Recognising the short time I have left, we are demanding legislation on agency workers, and its content is crucial.  The Government says it will bring forward legislation to address the concerns during the course of this debate, but if the Government thinks it can get away with bringing in legislation that deals with this issue in a half-hearted way, it is deeply mistaken.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers, from listening to their contributions last night, are, like their leader in Government, masters of mutter when it comes to confusing the issues.  It is well known that they have been blocking progress on agency workers at EU level, yet they pretend they are part of a search for a consensus.  They clearly have no wish to confront exploitative employers, especially in the construction sector, but their foot-dragging penalises agency workers and their families.  It allows the scourge of exploitation to spread in our economy and it penalises good employers who provide decent wages and conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">Workers and trade unions and progressive elected representatives of the Labour and Sinn Féin parties and others, I hope, who will join us here this evening, are not prepared to drop this issue.  We will pursue this Government until it is forced to relent and to vindicate the right of all agency workers without exception.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_1365">In concluding this debate I thank my colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose, for proposing the motion and Deputy Arthur Morgan for seconding it.  I also thank his Sinn Féin colleagues for co-signing the motion with the Labour Party.  I thank all the Members who contributed to the debate in which, it is fair to say, there has been broad agreement on the necessity for legislation to protect the rights of temporary agency workers.  I compliment the trade union movement on campaigning on this issue and engaging with public representatives about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366">I understand very fully the nature of negotiations that trade unions enter with employers and Government and the nature of the negotiations that lead to a social partnership agreement.  I believe strongly that the issues of pay, issues of the wide gaps which are opening up in the levels of reward that people get for work and issues relating to the exploitation of workers and the rights of workers are issues that are wider than those who directly participate in negotiations about pay, whether at local or national level.  Those issues should increasingly be debated in this House.  We have serious issues of inequality in our society, inequality and unfairness in the workplace and in the labour market that require to be publicly debated and the forum for that is this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">We have made progress on this issue in the course of the past two days.  When we returned to this House after Christmas, the promised legislation to give rights to agency workers had been relegated by the Government to division three in the legislative programme.  I am pleased that as a result of the tabling of this motion over these two nights, the Government is now promising to bring forward that legislation to have it published and dealt with in this session, which is what I understood the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs promised yesterday evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368">I express some caution on two fronts.  First, there are many precedents for Government promising to bring forward legislation in the heat of debate during Private Members' motions and, when the heat of debate has died down and those who are interested in the issue have left the Visitors Gallery, the foot goes off the pedal and the legislation disappears on to the backburner.  The second caution I express has to do with the small print in the Government amendment to the motion.  The Government is proposing to introduce primary legislation "aimed at enhanced compliance and enforcement of employment rights generally, including legislation to regulate the operation of employment agencies and a statutory code of practice for employment agencies".  That does not commit to what is required in the legislation, which is the principle of equal treatment being applied in respect of the employment of agency workers and a comprehensive provision for the enforcement of those rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_1370">With that caution in mind, the Labour Party intends to progress this issue somewhat further.  I am disappointed the Government is insisting on amending the motion because, given the degree of agreement in the contributions made, including by Ministers and members of the Government parties, I thought this was an occasion when the Government might have accepted the motion.  If the Government insists on pressing its amendment and in effect defeating the motion tabled by the Labour Party and Sinn Féin, the Labour Party will progress this issue by introducing our own Bill to protect temporary agency workers.  My colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose, has been working on this issue for some time and has been preparing legislation for introduction in the House to give to temporary agency workers the equal treatment which they deserve, to give them the fairness and the protection of their rights which they and their representatives are seeking.  The Labour Party has completed its preparation of that Bill which we will publish next week and introduce in the House on First Stage at the first available opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371">This is an important issue which cannot be allowed to rest on the basis of a promise from Government.  Too often in the past, we have seen Government being all things to all people on issues like this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372">I do not intend to introduce a contrarian note into this discussion but I disagree with the point made by Deputy Ferris where he attributes the difficulty here to the Lisbon treaty or to the European Union.  Our problem with this issue is much closer to home.  As Deputy Penrose pointed out last night and as is contained in the very fine document which has been circulated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, 18 member states of the European Union have domestic legislation which protects the rights of temporary agency workers.  The European Union has been attempting to introduce a directive to give rights to temporary agency workers and the Government is just one of three governments which, despite what the Minister of State said this evening, has been blocking that legislation.  It is in this country that the legislation needs to be introduced and it is here in this Parliament that it needs to be enacted to give those rights to temporary agency workers, irrespective of whether they are Irish agency workers or from elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">This issue is critically important now as this country is turning an economic corner.  It was very easy for Government to be all things to all people when times were very good; to be on the side of the worker, business, the entrepreneur, the builder and the housebuyer, all at the one time, but we are entering an era where certain choices will have to be made.  One of those choices is whether we as a country and the Government and its agencies, and this House, stand by those who are most vulnerable in changing economic circumstances.  Those who are most vulnerable are those who earn the lowest levels of pay, those in the most insecure employment, those first out the door when things begin to tighten in an enterprise.  In this case, they are the people who are employed on an agency basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">The issue of agency workers, which is the subject directly addressed by tonight's motion, is one that requires urgent attention.  It is estimated there may be as many as 120,000 workers involved.  I heard the Minister say yesterday that it is 2% of the workforce, which is not quite in line with the point made by the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who effectively acknowledged that a very large number of undocumented workers are working in economy and need to be protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375">I welcome the supportive comments made on this motion tonight.  I hope the Government will stand by its commitment to introduce the legislation.  However, just in case it does not, the Labour Party will introduce its own Bill on the issue and we will pursue it at the first available opportunity in the House.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
            <p eId="para_1646">Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance consider awarding primary medical certificates to persons with mentally disabilities and Down's syndrome under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994?   I put this question to the Minister some weeks ago.  I dislike categorising any individual but there are six categories under which one may qualify for a primary medical certificate whereby one can avail of a concession on vehicle registration tax, VRT, and motor tax.  I ask the Minister to include in this categorisation the parents or guardians of persons with mental disabilities and sufferers of Down's syndrome.  While such persons are entitled to drive when they become adults, they will never be able to do so and are entirely dependent on their parents or guardians for transportation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">Under the current regime, only persons who are missing at least one limb or have the medical condition of dwarfism qualify for the disabled drivers grant.  Mentally disabled persons and those with Down's syndrome are entitled to this benefit.  In Northern Ireland and Britain, for example, people with Down's syndrome qualify for the primary medical certificate whereby their parents or guardians can avail of exemptions on VAT and VRT on the purchase of a car.  It would be a progressive step on the part of the Government to provide this benefit to parents who are primary carers of their mentally disabled or Down's syndrome children.  Their lives are dedicated to providing for those children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1648">I understand the disabled drivers grant represents a significant expenditure for the State.  The majority of people availing of the grant change their cars every two years.  I accept that there are limited resources and that the cake is already divided among many beneficiaries.  However, a legislative provision whereby recipients of the grant could change their cars only every four years rather than every two years would halve the cost to the State and facilitate the inclusion of the parents or guardians of persons with mental disabilities or Down's syndrome within the scheme.  I strongly urge the Minister to consider such an amendment.  Such persons are unlikely ever to be able to drive and are entirely dependent on their parents or guardians in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">This would be a positive initiative on the part of the Government.  I have seen parents dedicate their lives to their children with mental disabilities or Down's syndrome.  Their inclusion in this scheme would provide support of which they are entirely deserving.  Nobody would wish to see a return to previous times when children with mental disabilities and Down's syndrome were sent to mental institutions.  The parents of these children want to care for them themselves and provide an important service to society in so doing.  The State should support them where possible.  They do everything for their children, bringing them to and from school, leisure activities and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">I applaud the work being done on behalf of people with Down's syndrome and other mental handicaps.  I refer to sporting organisations like Special Olympics Ireland, for example.  The proposal I have made, which would help to lift the burden on parents, would be a positive thing for the Government to do and would greatly help families.  I accept that a limited amount of funding is available, although it could be divided better.  People who are availing of the disabled drivers scheme will probably contact me in the morning to complain about what I am saying tonight.  I feel very strongly that many more people could be accommodated under the scheme.  It would be a positive step if the Government were to adopt the approach being taken in Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_501">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Noel Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1651">The disabled drivers scheme was established in 1968.  Under section 43 of the Finance Act of that year, relief from road tax is offered to people with a disability who meet specific medical criteria.  The scheme has been extended and amended on a number of occasions since then.  The benefits of the scheme for those who qualify are set out in the 1968 Act.  Such people are entitled to full vehicle registration tax and VAT relief in the relevant tax year when they purchase an adapted vehicle, subject to limits of €9,525 for a qualifying driver and €15,875 for a qualifying passenger or organisation.  In the case of passengers, there is a requirement that the adaptation to the car must amount to at least 10% of the cost of the car.  In the case of both drivers and passengers, the vehicle must be retained for at least two years.  Those who avail of the scheme are also entitled to an exemption from road tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_1652">The average total annualised value of these benefits is estimated at around €5,500 per claimant.  In the year of purchase of a car, a claimant receives benefits relating to the purchase of the car and road tax.  In the other years, the benefits received relate solely to road tax.  The regulations also provide for the inclusion in the scheme of non-profit organisations involved in the transport of people with a disability.  The most recent data available from the Revenue Commissioners for the overall scale and scope of the scheme show that the total number of claimants in the system in 2007 was approximately 12,500 — some 4,750 drivers and 7,750 passengers.  The total cost of the scheme in 2007, excluding road tax, was €66 million.  That figure increases to €74 million when road tax is included.</p>
            <p eId="para_1653">All Deputies come across genuine cases.  This issue has been discussed on several occasions since I was first elected to this House.  The regulations governing the scheme have been amended and adjusted.  I accept that the reply that has been circulated is a standard one.  It might not seem to get to the core of the case made by Deputy Sheahan.  Strict medical criteria are set for qualification for this generous scheme, which is not open to all people with a disability.  It is available to those who have certain serious permanent physical disabilities which result in considerable mobility difficulty.  The Deputy has outlined broadly the six categories of disability which are covered in the scheme.  A fundamental requirement for admission to the scheme is that the applicant meets the specified medical criteria and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect.  A person who is deemed to satisfy the criteria is given a certificate by the senior medical officer of the local HSE area.  Possession of a certificate qualifies the holder to claim the benefits of the scheme as a qualifying driver or passenger.</p>
            <p eId="para_1654">In some cases, those who apply do not appear to the senior medical officer to meet the criteria and the certificate is therefore refused.  The legislation provides for an appeals procedure, operated by the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, when a certificate is not granted.  The board is an independent body and its decision is final.  Its members are appointed by the Minister for Finance, on the nomination of the Minister for Health and Children.  Considerable efforts have been made in recent years to improve the level of service offered when appeals are made.  Further work is needed in this regard.  Following a period of difficulty in organising sufficient meetings of the medical board of appeal, the board was reconstituted in early 2005.  The number of people on the panel of doctors has been incrementally expanded from three to 15 since that date.  This has facilitated more frequent meetings of the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1655">I was not aware until Deputy Sheahan mentioned it that children and adults with Down's syndrome are covered by the schemes which operate in Northern Ireland and England.  I will bring that to the attention of the Minister.  This country's scheme is very generous for people in the six categories who qualify for it.  Those who benefit from the scheme can change their cars every two years.  This generous scheme costs quite a bit.  It is very helpful for those who qualify.  I accept that it may seem to those who do not qualify that the scheme is mean, miserable and tight.  I will bring the point made by the Deputy about Down's syndrome to the personal attention of the Minister for Finance, who will see if changes can be made.</p>

            <p eId="para_1659">I welcome the opportunity to raise the urgent need to review the provision of an ambulance service in County Clare 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  There needs to be a specific emphasis on the provision of such a service to areas like west Clare.  Three special deliveries in recent weeks, when three women gave birth in separate incidents, brought this issue to the fore.  The common denominator in the three cases was that no ambulance was available to transfer the expectant mother to hospital.  All three mothers and their families live in west Clare — two in Kilrush and one in Kilbaha, which is approximately 100 km from Limerick.  Coincidentally, the women went into labour within hours of one another on 4 and 5 February last.  One woman waited for an ambulance for over an hour before her father drove her to hospital.  Another woman had to wait three hours before she arrived at the maternity hospital in Limerick.  The third woman gave birth on the side of the road.  All three mothers and babies are well in spite of their ordeal, thank God.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">Since the withdrawal of maternity services from County Clare, it is common for expectant mothers in west Clare to have to make a pilgrimage of this nature.  It is of concern that in all three cases, no ambulance service was available when telephone calls were made to the 999 service.  The organisation of the ambulance service in the outlying areas of County Clare is putting the lives of people at risk.  Ambulance service personnel in the county are to be commended for the excellent service they provide in trying circumstances.  However, their work needs to be complemented by a review of the organisation of the entire service.  We need to eliminate the dependence on "on-call" services.  Rather than all ambulance personnel being in the ambulance centre, some of them are on call from their homes, which can add a minimum of 20 minutes to the call-out time.  Such a delay in the start of the ambulance's journey to the person in need can be vital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">The ambulance service in County Clare is clearly under-resourced and under-staffed.  In this case, no staff were available in Kilrush to work on the ambulance due to sick leave, etc., and an ambulance had to be dispatched from the Ennis centre.  This is not an isolated case, sadly.  It is common practice for ambulance crews in Ennis, Ennistymon, Kilrush and Scarriff to be dispatched to the four corners of the county.  They also have to provide a back-up service for the regional hospital in Limerick.  As staffing numbers are at a minimum — some workers are on sick leave etc. — there is extreme pressure on the delivery of the service.  For example, there was a 25-minute delay in responding to a recent incident in Ennis town centre because the ambulances at the Ennis station were out on other calls.  A private ambulance had to be called in to assist in that case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">The Labour Court recently recommended that an additional 180 emergency medical technicians be recruited to the service throughout the country.  That recruitment and training should not be delayed or postponed.  A review of the ambulance service should also consider the provision of advanced paramedics as part of a special response unit, which could be made available throughout the county for emergencies.  Kilrush would be an ideal location for a permanent advanced paramedic posting because it is 44 km from the nearest hospital.  Such highly trained personnel are currently under-utilised.  They should not be seen as additional staff in their centres, but as part of the centres' crewing numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1663">Despite the Minister's commitment to provide a 24-hour accident and emergency service at Ennis General Hospital, there is huge apprehension in west Clare that the situation will get significantly worse for those who have the misfortune to get sick.  Recent incidents do little to dispel this fear.  The people of west Clare do not have access to a first-class ambulance service, never mind a first-class health service.  They deserve better.</p>
            <p eId="para_1664">The HSE recently launched a hospital hygiene campaign, Wash Your Hands.  If the executive is serious about hygiene, it should immediately address the scenario in Ennis ambulance station.  It is an absolute disgrace that staff are expected to clean out ambulances with nothing more than a mop and bucket.  I recently visited the ambulance centre and I was appalled to witness at first hand how the ambulance personnel clean their vehicles.  They must clean out coagulated blood in a public car park, which is a hygiene scandal.  These are Third World conditions in a first world economy.  Staff have been waiting more than three years for a new wash unit.  How long more must they wait?  I appeal to the Minister of State to bring the matter to the attention of the HSE immediately.  Perhaps he will get back to me in regard to same because it is a total disgrace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1665">Our excellent medical personnel are continuously fighting to give their patients the best medical help in a system in which penny pinching practices are increasing.  I urge the Minister of State to request the HSE to undertake immediately a review of the ambulance service in County Clare.  The review should focus on the provision of a 24-7 service in isolated rural areas, particularly in west Clare, to extend the operation of the Scarriff station to 24 hours and to revisit the provision of an ambulance centre in Shannon, the second largest town in the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">If efforts are not made to address and reorganise the ambulance service in County Clare, more incidents will happen and people's lives will be lost.  Having visited the ambulance centre a few days ago, I ask the Minister of State to contact the HSE regarding the primitive working conditions of staff cleaning out their ambulances and to come back to me about it.</p>

          <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_506">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1667">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">It is regrettable that the mothers referred to by the Deputy should have suffered undue distress, particularly as the birth of a child should take place in a safe, secure environment.  I have been advised that while, thankfully, such incidents are rare, the HSE will examine the circumstances which culminated in the unfortunate events.  The HSE apologises unreservedly to the three mothers.  Both the Minister and myself hope that the events leading up to the birth of these babies have not taken from the joy which the birth of a child brings to parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669">A number of objectives were identified in the Strategic Review of the Ambulance Service 2001, which were to lead to an improvement in response times and, ultimately, more effective responses to emergency calls.  In recent years, substantial additional funds have been invested to develop the ambulance service along the lines identified in the strategic review and this work will continue into the future.  Since the publication of the review, as part of the revised organisational framework developed under the Health Service Executive, a national ambulance service has been established to replace the eight ambulance services that operated under the former health board structure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670">The HSE has advised that, within the greater mid-western area, resources are deployed from nine ambulance stations based on the policy to dispatch the nearest available ambulance to respond to emergency calls.  While the location of the ambulance station may be important, it is not the only factor, as resources and skill mix can be tactically deployed based on priority and demand.  For example, the ambulance may be diverted, while <i>en route</i> to a routine call, to an emergency call.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">County Clare is 3438 sq. km. and has a total population of 110,000.  The county is serviced by ambulance stations in Ennis, Ennistymon, Kilrush and Scarriff with 24-hour services in all but Scarriff, which provides 19 hours of cover per day.  Part of County Clare is also serviced by Limerick ambulance station.  Since the inception of the HSE's national ambulance service, there has been significant investment in ambulance services in terms of estate facilities, education, training, fleet and equipment.  To ensure optimum use of the Government's investment, one of the critical objectives of the service is to develop models of pre-hospital emergency care that will meet existing and future demands.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">In conjunction with the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, a statutory agency that has responsibility for clinical education and training standards as well as response time standards, the national ambulance service is researching the demand for emergency services and associated ambulance services in the context of the developing the optimum deployment of resources.  This research is being undertaken by way of a national spatial analysis study.  The outcome of this study will be used for the development of pre-hospital emergency services and, in particular, for tactical deployment of resources and future planning of services in terms of models of care, skill mix of staff, ambulance response points and fleet configuration.  This study will form the bedrock for pre-hospital emergency care development in the future.  It will then be possible to ensure that available resources are targeted to the best advantage in terms of response times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">The Deputy raised a number of specific questions and, as requested, I will ask the HSE's parliamentary affairs division to correspond with him in this regard.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_508">
            <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_1675">The people of Mallow, north Cork, south Tipperary and east Limerick fear for the future of Mallow General Hospital, MGH.  The 100 general practitioners who wrote to the Minister in September stated they are in despair and that "a blinkered vision of health delivery is slavishly following foreign models without taking into account the existing nature and makeup of the Irish Health Service".  They contend, as do I, that all patient contact should be in centres of excellence, be it in primary, secondary or tertiary care.  MGH is a primary example of a secondary facility that has punched above its weight, in spite of concerted efforts to downgrade it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">The Government, by reducing the hospital's budget by more than €500,000, did not take into account the fact that the information being supplied to warrant a cut is at best misleading and does not take into account certain factors.  The hospital networks section of the HSE south, when asked to provide specifics in reply to questions I have posed to the Minister, responded with generalities which leave us none the wiser.  I have tabled numerous questions to the Minister on the future of the hospital, the appointment of an executive management structure, the appointment of a radiologist, casemix, and the appointment of a radiographer to oversee the CT scanner that has been sitting in an empty room for years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">On the issue of casemix, I refer to Parliamentary Question No. 400 on 30 January 2008, where the HSE in response to my question on the €500,000 cut to the hospitals budget stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1678">Mallow General Hospital has received a negative casemix adjustment of €571,233 for 2008 (which is based on 2006 activity).  Management at the hospital are examining the underlying causes of the negative casemix adjustment for 2008 and a rigorous scrutiny of the hospital's base costs will be carried out.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">MGH's budget had been cut because the workload of the hospital had been under measured through casemix because of a lack of clerical staff, but it does not suit the HSE to admit this.  I have it on good authority that only 95% of MGH's workload was captured.  The HSE's official line is that the budget was cut because of "inefficiencies".  Nobody disputes that MGH's budget is the lowest in the country or that its workload is greater than many comparable  hospitals.  How is it then that its budget is cut?</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">I refer to the appointment of an executive management board.  Why has Bantry hospital, with a smaller catchment area than Mallow, an EMB?  I applaud Bantry hospital in this regard but it is lucky.  The answers I received are an insult to the people I represent.  I refer to Parliamentary Question No. 119 of 31 January 2008, in which I asked about the make up and reintroduction of the executive management structure.  In its reply, the HSE stated that management of both the Cork University Hospital group and Mallow General Hospital are keen to enhance the management structures at the hospital and have over the past several months been working with the HSE's performance and development unit to facilitate the process of establishing an executive management board at Mallow hospital.  It continued that key stakeholders have been met on a one-to-one basis to explore concerns, expectations, visions for the future and development needs, that discussions are ongoing and that a proposal to re-establish the executive management board at the hospital is currently being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">According to the HSE, the review has taken slightly longer than anticipated because its scope was broadened to incorporate community-based services and to allow wider consultation with key stakeholders, including medical staff from the Mallow catchment area.  Again, the HSE speaks in generalities but is short on specifics.  It fails to acknowledge that an executive management board was in place Mallow General Hospital which ceased to operate and was never replaced.  As for its assertion that there was a consultation with key stakeholders, this is stretching the truth.  I can name 95 GPs who are key stakeholders in the area but were never consulted.  I know of nobody in community-based services who was consulted.  Which key stakeholders and medical staff from the Mallow catchment area were consulted?  What does the HSE regard as the Mallow catchment area?</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">In the same reply, the HSE states that the acute hospital services review in HSE south will determine overall governance arrangements.  To whom has the proposal for an executive management board for Mallow General Hospital been sent?  On the issue of the CT scanner, which is also addressed in the reply, if the HSE see the benefits of the scanner, why did it not put a proper management plan in place in 2005?</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">We are concerned for the future of the hospital and that the acute hospitals review will seek to downgrade our accident and emergency services, postpone further appointments when current surgical terms of employment end and further delay the building of a day procedures unit.  We want to see the appointment of a radiographer because we have waited too long for one.  We want Mallow General Hospital to be a centre of excellence for secondary care.  We are proud of our Hospital.  If the HSE persists in downgrading the hospital by stealth, we will protest vigorously.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_1684">I thank Deputy Sherlock for giving me the opportunity to reply on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_1685">I am advised that capital funding of €1.5 million was sanctioned by the Department of Health and Children for the installation and dedicated accommodation of a CT scanner at Mallow General Hospital in October 2004.  Following receipt of fire certification and planning approvals, tendering arrangements for the entire project were put in place and work on the premises commenced in late 2005.  In the meantime, tendering arrangements for the purchase of the scanner were also put in place.  The scanner was delivered in December 2006 and the necessary commissioning works were undertaken by the supplier and completed in August 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">In regard to staffing, formal sanction for the posts was received by the HSE in September 2007 and the necessary arrangements to commence the recruitment and appointment of the appropriate staff were put in place without delay.  Interviews for the clinical specialist radiographer, CT technician and senior radiographer were held during November 2007 and suitable candidates were identified.  I understand that the HSE will be in a position to progress these appointments in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">Mallow General Hospital and Mercy University Hospital have approval for two consultant radiologist posts in a reciprocal sessional arrangement between the hospitals.  The filling of these posts has been held up due to the consultants talks.  The management of Mallow General Hospital, Mercy University Hospital and the southern hospital group are now in discussion on the timeframe for the filling of these posts.  Subject to the staff being in place, it is expected that the CT scanner should be operational by May.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">In regard to the budget, Mallow General Hospital has received a negative casemix adjustment of €571,233, based on 2006 activity.  Casemix was introduced in an effort to collect, categorise and interpret hospital patient data related to the type of cases treated to assist managers define their services, measure productivity and assess quality.  Casemix contributes towards equity, efficiency and transparency by clarifying and categorising hospital throughput.  By allowing peer group comparisons, it creates an incentive for better performance.  Management at Mallow General Hospital is currently examining the underlying causes of the negative casemix adjustment for 2008 and a rigorous scrutiny of the hospital's base costs is being carried out.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">In regard to the other issues raised by the Deputy, I will obtain a copy of the report and request the parliamentary affairs division of the HSE to correspond directly with him.</p>

          <heading>Schools Building Projects.</heading>
          <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_510">
            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_1690">I protest in the strongest possible terms at the unacceptable treatment of three applications for new school buildings in County Mayo.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">The principal and board of management of Midfield national school, Swinford, have been pursuing building extension and renovation works for over ten years.  The Department of Education and Science's consultants acknowledged the school's urgent need in 1998 and €30,000 was spent on professional fees.  The project went to the costing stage but was then shelved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1692">In 2006 the school authorities were advised to re-apply under the small schools scheme and an architect was commissioned to carry out a report.  He noted that other businesses would be shut down under health and safety regulations as the classrooms, heating system, sewerage system, roof, windows, toilets and play areas were all substandard.  The septic tank is seeping sewage near the play areas.  This application will become an emergency in September 2008 when projected numbers will necessitate the employment of an extra teacher.  The school is trying to function under Third World conditions while coping with the increasing numbers of children being enrolled.  One parent asked me in the context of the Taoiseach's announcement last December of €5 million for shanty towns in Cape Town how the school could be treated so badly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">Gaelscoil Uileog De Búrca in Claremorris opened in 1989 with an enrolment of eight children.   Attendance is currently 109 children and the projected enrolment for next year is 120.  In 1998 the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, promised a new school if a site was agreed.  The site was purchased in 2005 and further land was acquired in 2007.  The Department has promised a new eight-classroom school and the sanction of the current Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is awaited.  The school has operated for ten years out of an old, dilapidated two-teacher premises with four prefabs at an annual rent of €70,000.  The school could have been built for the amount of money that had to be spent leasing prefabs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">St. Joseph's national school, Bonniconlon, is another project which has been ongoing for more than 10 years, causing frustration for teachers, pupils, parents and the board of management.  In 2000 the local community began fundraising for the local contribution and accessed alternative accommodation to have everything in readiness when the application passed through the various planning stages.  The Minister sanctioned the building of the new school at a meeting in Knock in 2006.  The board of management was told on umpteen occasions that the building would go to tender in January 2008 only to get the dreaded phone call from the Department in the week before Christmas.  The board of management is now totally frustrated and feels isolated, particularly following the emergence of the recent list of school building projects in respect of which the go-ahead was announced at the end of January.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">The Minister and the Department have assured us that resources are not solely going into rapidly developing areas but the evidence points to the contrary.  The three schools to which I refer are situated in areas of developing population and the teachers, parents and boards of management are very angry at the lack of transparency in the system which gave the go-ahead to the recently announced projects and left those to which I refer, which are long awaited and much needed, in limbo.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">Under previous Administrations, the school building programme was considered slow but fair and schools knew their place in the queue.  However, school boards of management throughout the country are now questioning the transparency of a programme that is excluding previously approved schools without explanation.  There is genuine anger in those schools that have waited years for projects involving renovations, extensions or the construction of new school buildings to commence and in respect of which progress is yet to be made.  In the meantime, other schools appear to be getting the go-ahead to proceed to construction and this is leading to complaints about the lack of transparency in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">I call on the Minister to include the schools to which I refer in the next round of announcements in order that the communities they serve can have access, in appropriate school buildings, to the high standard of education they richly deserve.</p>

          <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_511" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_1698">I thank Deputy O'Mahony for raising this matter.  I welcome the opportunity to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science's position regarding the provision of new school buildings for Bonniconlon national school, Gaelscoil Uileog De Búrca and St. Joseph's national school, Midfield, Swinford.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">In the lifetime of the national development plan, almost €4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  Approximately €600 million of this will be spent this year on school buildings.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  This investment will facilitate the provision of new schools and extensions in developing areas and the improvement of existing schools through the provision of replacement schools, extensions or large-scale refurbishments in the coming years.  The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the national development plan and the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">As regards the position of the three schools to which Deputy O'Mahony refers, the project relating to Bonniconlon national school is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning in respect of the provision of a new three-classroom school.  I understand the tender documentation for this project is nearing completion.  The Minister for Education and Science intends to announce projects that will proceed to construction during the year and Bonniconlon will be considered in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">A site for a proposed new school building for Gaelscoil Uileog De Búrca was acquired last year and an assessment of projected enrolment trends, demographic trends and housing developments in the area will be required in order to determine the long-term projected staffing figure on which the school's accommodation needs will be based.  It is heartening to note that a school established in 1989 with eight pupils now has an enrolment of 109.  The latter is expected to rise to 120 next year.  I am a great supporter of gaelscoileanna, which offer an opportunity for children in schools outside the Gaeltacht to pursue their studies through the medium of Irish.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">St. Joseph's national school, Midfield, previously applied for an extension and refurbishment to provide for improved ancillary accommodation, such as a general purpose room, a multipurpose or staff room, a remedial room and a general office.  The proposed project did not include additional mainstream classrooms.  However, in January of this year the Department of Education and Science received a new application in respect of additional accommodation.  This will be considered in the context of the multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1703">On behalf of the Minister, I wish to assure the Deputy that she and her Department are committed to providing high-quality accommodation for Bonniconlon national school, Gaelscoil Uileog De Búrca and St. Joseph's national school, Midfield, at the earliest possible date.  I will communicate to her the strong view expressed by Deputy O'Mahony.</p>

         the steps she is taking to address the lack of sports facilities in schools, particularly primary schools.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1705">The Physical Education curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary, depending on the size of the school and the extent of the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the PE programme. A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level.  In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to promoting appropriate levels of exercise for our children and young people — both in their community and at school.  The extent and quality of local sports facilities has been improved dramatically in recent years, with more than €450 million invested by the Government since 1998 in over 5,000 projects through the Sports Capital Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">At the same time, general purpose and outdoor play facilities have been provided for schools all over the country through the School Building Programme.  Over €2.6 billion was expended on school building infrastructure between 2000 and 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">For the period between 2007 and 2013, €4.5 billion, including almost €600 million this year, is to be invested under the National Development Plan.  New curricula for PE in primary schools and at Junior Cert level have also been put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">Primary schools received €2,000 each in PE equipment grants in 2006, at a total cost of €6.5 million.  A similar grant of €4,000 per pupil, at an overall cost of around €3 million, issued to post-primary schools in 2007.  In addition, since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.  Such materials and equipment would normally have a useful life of several years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">My Department also works closely with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Department of Health and Children through the Health Service Executive in funding improved playing facilities through the Clár and Rapid Area Schemes and the Dormant Account Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">Through an increased focus on exercise in schools and in the community, the Government is working to provide the facilities to encourage more children and young people to get active.  Indeed, the ‘State of the Nation's Children' report launched by the Minister for Children in 2007, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1714">The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas, including the impact of immigration, and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.  Major progress has been made in meeting all of those needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">We have dramatically increased investment in the school building programme in recent years.  During the period of the last National Development Plan 2000-2006 my Department accelerated the school building programme with record levels of investment and the streamlining of delivery systems.  An aggregate total of well over €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second-level.  This programme delivered over 7,800 building projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">In 2007, over 1,500 projects were delivered, including over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for approximately 17,500 pupils, mainly in developing areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">The Government is making available almost €600 million for the school building programme in 2008. A key priority of the programme in 2008 and subsequent years will be the delivery of additional capacity in the rapidly developing areas.  I am conscious of the need to provide more school places in these areas quickly and these are being delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">However, I am equally conscious of the need to address the needs of the many schools throughout the country which may not be in rapidly developing areas but which need major investment for refurbishment and extension.  I intend that projects in these schools will also proceed during 2008 and 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">New schools have been built in rapidly developing areas and more are planned to accommodate continuing demographic changes. Many schools have had extensions built.  Major refurbishments of schools have also been undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">Not only are we investing far more in school buildings, but the improvements that have been made in the planning, design and delivery processes are also helping to deliver projects much faster.  There is now much greater forward-planning, with close and regular engagement with local authorities, while a new partnership model has been developed to deliver community facilities in tandem with new schools and the publication of 10-year Area Development Plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest time-frame possible.  My Department also adopted a policy of devolving much greater authority to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, thereby freeing my Department to concentrate on the larger scale projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">In my most recent announcement on the 2008 large-scale building programme, I approved 48 projects to commence construction including 30 new primary schools in rapidly developing areas that are planned to be in place by next September under an accelerated building programme.  It is also intended to provide additional accommodation at a number of schools under this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">My Department also has other projects coming on stream to the tendering and construction stages and I will be making further announcements about these as the 2008 school building programme is rolled out.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">I assure the Deputy that through both increased investment under the NDP and the improved planning and delivery processes that we have put in place in recent years, the Government will ensure that school accommodation needs will be met.</p>

         if she proposes to establish an education convention to consider the future of governance and management in the primary school system here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1726">The issues around future governance and management in the primary school system, in the context of changing circumstances, are the subject of dialogue on an ongoing basis with each of the patron bodies, management bodies and education partners.  Education issues have also featured strongly in the ongoing structured dialogue between the Government, churches, faith communities and non-confessional organisations in Ireland which are being led by the Taoiseach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">The Deputy will be aware that last December I announced further details of a new model of patronage at primary school level to be piloted from September 2008.  The new community national school model reflects the impact of growing diversity in Irish society on the traditional structures for primary education provision.  The model will aim to cater for the wishes of parents for denominational, multi-denominational and non-denominational education within the framework of a single patron model and single board of management structure.  The model is not intended to replace the existing patron models but to provide an additional option, likely to be used particularly in growing areas.  Three schools will be included in the initial pilot under the patronage of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee (VEC).</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">The implementation of the new pilot patronage model has also involved, and will continue to involve, consultations with the main patron bodies, management bodies and partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">Our current system of school management has served us well. It means that communities have a strong role in how schools are run and that Patrons can ensure that their ethos is promoted in their schools.  Such a locally-based system places a lot of responsibility on board members and my Department is anxious to ensure that members of boards are provided with training and other supports that are needed to discharge board members' responsibilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">In recognition of these responsibilities, the Teacher Education Section of my Department has developed a new scheme for the provision of support to school management bodies for the purpose of training and development of boards of management in the discharge of their duties and consistent with national and DES priorities.  This scheme is administered through the Drumcondra Education Centre.</p>

            <p eId="para_1732">I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that it is my intention to publish a Data Strategy for my Department, covering the 2008 to 2010 period, in March 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">The Data Strategy will provide an important contribution to the ongoing development of the evidence-base for education policy over the coming years.  Making better use of existing data as well as introducing new and essential sources of information is a key goal for the Department as it seeks to provide services in an increasingly diverse and challenging environment.  The Strategy will outline a number of goals and actions to improve the quality and supply of data over the coming three-year period within the resources available to the Department and associated agencies. Included among these will be the development of a Learner Database to encompass all pupils at Primary level and, as a subsequent phase, students at post-primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">The development of a Learner Database at Primary level has been identified as a priority in the Programme for Government.  It has the potential to facilitate better policy-planning and evaluation and more detailed identification of learner needs in different parts of the country.  As part of the development, work has already begun in examining the feasibility of developing a single information platform for schools on which data providers could exchange information with the Department and key agencies such as NEWB, NCSE and the State Examinations Commission.  The scale of operation involved, the complexities relating to multiple data requirements and the availability of staff resources to advance the project need to be carefully considered.  Resulting from this initial exploratory phase it will be possible to scope out the likely scale and timeline of a Learner Database.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">My aim is to improve the quality and scale of data-gathering, subject to data protection guidelines and legislation, to provide up-to-date information on the situation in relation to any pupil — where they are at school, if they are not in any form of education or training and how their needs can be best catered for.  This is why the development of a single individualised Learner Database — based on the Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) — and linked to relevant public data holdings can transform the possibilities for using high-quality information and support public services to individual learners as well as reduce the burden of data collection on schools who presently have to make multiple returns to various agencies.</p>

        <b>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         if, in view of the cash flow problems which aggravate the inadequate funding arrangements for primary schools, she will introduce a new administrative scheme whereby the capitation grant for primary schools is paid quarterly, in January, April, July and October, involving no additional or extra cost to her Department but ensuring a more effective flow of funding to the primary school system; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [6048/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_516">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1737">My first priority in relation to improving the cash flow for schools is to increase the level of funding to them. Improving the funding for schools is a central part of the education provisions in the Programme for Government.  The Programme contains the commitment by Government that the capitation grant for primary schools will be doubled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">My Department will be paying around €167m to primary schools in 2008 to meet their day to day running costs.  The improvements announced in the last budget taken together mean that day-to-day funding for primary schools will increase by €21 to €330 per pupil.  As a result, a primary school with 300 pupils will receive almost €100,000 to meet their running costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years.  Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €178.58 from 1st January, 2008.  This represents an increase of 212% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from €457.00 to €880 per pupil — an increase of 42% from the rate in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">Capitation grants in respect of a particular school year are paid to primary schools in two moieties.  The first moiety (approximately 70%) is paid in January with the balance normally being paid in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">The first instalment in January is calculated on the enrolment figure on the 30th September of the previous school year as the up-to-date enrolment data is not available in my Department at that stage.  The balance of the grant is calculated on the enrolment figure on the 30th September of the current school year together with any arrears due from the first instalment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">Contrary to what the Deputy suggests there would either be once-off cost implications for the Department or, if not, then there would be initial negative cash flow implications for schools by changing the payments system to four equal instalments.  For example, if the Deputy's proposal was implemented this year without any additional cost to my Department in 2008 it would potentially involve the balance of this year's grant that is normally paid in June being deferred to October.  Similarly, if the proposal was being introduced from the start of 2009 then instead of the 70% grant being paid in January schools would have to wait for that element of it to be paid out in instalments during January, April and July.  I would be concerned that during the changeover period this would further aggravate rather than help the cash flow in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">An alternative to that proposed by the Deputy would be to bring forward the January payment to pre-Christmas so that it is paid earlier in the school year.  However, this would also have once-off cost implications for the Exchequer and my priority is to target all available funds to making real increases in the grant level instead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">I remain open to considering any proposals put forward on the payments structure that can be implemented without additional cost but given that the existing payment structure front loads 70% of the payment at the start of the calendar year it is difficult to see how this could be done without actually impacting negatively on cash flow for schools.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1748">I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 124 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1749">Under the terms of my Department's student grant schemes, the position is that students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the prescribed conditions with regard to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1750">Students are categorised according to their circumstances either as independent mature students, mature students dependent on parents or guardians, or as students other than mature students.  In accordance with the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act 1992, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">An independent mature student is defined as meaning a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents or guardians from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.  Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' or guardians' income.  The reckonable income of an independent mature student is that of the candidate and his/her spouse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the means test provision of the scheme specifies that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit.  This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not deemed to be an independent mature student.</p>
            <p eId="para_1753">A number of representations have been received on this matter, seeking a review of the position where all students who are under the age of 23 are automatically assessed by reference to their parents' income, irrespective of their circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1754">I am pleased to advise you that the recently-published Student Support Bill will provide the Minister with the power to regulate for different categories of student, including the category of independent student.  This will enable me, if there are compelling reasons and adequate resources to do so, to consider extending the current definition of an independent student.</p>
            <p eId="para_1755">My Department is currently reviewing the circumstances where a means assessment independent of parental income would be appropriate, and in the context of the development of a new unified scheme of student support, is undertaking further consultation on this and related matters with a view to establishing the particular circumstances where assessment as an independent student might be warranted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">The Deputies will be aware that very significant numbers of our third-level students move out of home to go to college and continue to be supported by their parents.  The purpose of the student grant schemes is to provide additional assistance where parental income is below a certain threshold or, in the case of independent mature students, where the level of income of the student and his or her spouse warrants additional assistance by way of a grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">Therefore, any extension of the provision of assessment as an independent student will have to be carefully considered to ensure it is highly targeted at very specific circumstances where students can demonstrate that they have been genuinely self-supporting and living independently for a number of years.  The Deputies will appreciate that it would be untenable to have a situation whereby all students could simply move out of their parental home and be deemed to be independent for grants purposes.  This would have very significant implications for the student grants budget and would further disadvantage those who need the grant most.</p>

         the precise improvements that have taken place since the last general election in respect of the promised reduction in pupil-teacher ratios in the classroom, improved facilities for children with autism, Asperger’s syndrome or children with similar needs, improved speech and language therapy and psychological assessments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1759">The Deputy will be aware that major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are now in the region of 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc.  In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years in order to reduce class sizes.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">In relation to improved facilities for children with autism, Asperger's syndrome and children with similar needs, the Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post primary school network.  There are now in excess of 275 autism-specific classes around the country, an increase of 66 since the formation of the current Government.  The National Council Special Education (NCSE) will continue to establish classes where the need is identified.  As part of the continuing expansion of services nationwide I recently gave recognition to the Rehab Group as the patron of a new special school for children with autism in Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">The Deputy will be aware of the commitment in the current Programme for Government commitment to long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable them to be supported as primary schools for children with autism.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that this is being actively progressed between officials from my Department and the IAA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">The Deputy may be aware that in order to support teachers my Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in specific interventions associated with autism including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  This support has been greatly enhanced by the recruitment of a team of behaviour advisers, recruited since the last general election, under the leadership of a person with a PhD in ABA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1766">Since May 2007 the number of psychologists employed within the NEPS service has increased from 128 to 138 and it is my intention to further increase this complement to 169 within 2008.  In this regard, following a national recruitment process put in place in late 2007 by the Public Appointments Service, interviews are currently being held to form regional panels from which appointments to priority regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">In common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.  A measure of the effect of the above mentioned expansion of NEPS psychologist number, in terms of assessments conducted, will be taken at the end of the current academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">The Deputy will be aware that a cross-sectoral team has also been established, comprising senior officials from my Department, the NCSE, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE to co-ordinate the implementation of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 and the relevant sections of the EPSEN Act 2004.  The appointment of Deputy Jimmy Devins as a Minister of State, at the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, will also improve co-ordination between the two sectors in the interests of a better service for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">In 2002 my Department approved the provision of an additional 75 places on new courses in Speech and Language Therapy in U.C.C., N.U.I.G. and U.L. in addition to 25 places on an existing course in T.C.D.  As a result there has been a significant increase in the numbers of Speech and Language Therapists graduating from universities in recent years. Some 93 Therapists graduated 2007 compared to 21 in 2004.  It is understood from the Higher Education Authority that 109 places are currently offered annually on Speech and Language Therapy courses compared to 25 places in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">Significant development and improvements have been and will continue to be made in the range of areas identified by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1772">The National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for allocating special needs assistants (SNAs) to schools and for reviewing such allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">Special needs Assistants are intended to support children who have care needs arising from a disability.  There are currently in excess of 9,800 special needs assistants in primary, post-primary and special schools supporting children with special care needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">The break-down of these posts and the estimated annual cost per sector is as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">Primary Schools (including Special Schools): 8,038 Special Needs Assistants — Annual Cost €241.140m</p>

            <p eId="para_1780">The costs I have outlined for each sector are based on an average annual salary cost across each sector of €30,000.  The current salary scale is applicable from the 1st June 2007 as a result of the implementation of Phase 2 of the "Towards 2016" Social Partnership Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">I should also point out that special needs assistants in primary, voluntary secondary, community and comprehensive schools are employed by the individual school authority and paid centrally on my Department's payroll.  In the case of VEC schools, the special needs assistants are employed and paid directly by the VEC concerned.  A common salary scale applies across all sectors.</p>

The SCPA was established, pending the expansion to all schools of the service provided by NEPS psychologists, specifically to undertake assessments with individual children and young people.  School are allowed annual access the scheme at a level commensurate with 2% of school enrolment.

In 2007/08 to the end of January claims for some 1,731 assessments have been processed under the scheme, this figure is well in line with the number processed in this period of the preceding year.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1792">I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 137 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">The information requested by the Deputy in relation to teaching principals is currently being compiled by my Department for the 2007/08 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">In the 2006/07 school year there were 2,100 primary schools with teaching principals.  There were 159,500 pupils and 9,100 teachers (including ex-quota posts) in these schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">Schools with a staffing of a Principal and up to 6 mainstream class teachers have a teaching principal.  This is outlined in primary circular 0020/2007 which is available on my Department's website www.education.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">I am very conscious of the workload issues affecting Principal teachers who have a key role to play in determining the shape of our schools and I am glad to have the opportunity to acknowledge that the post of primary school principal is of critical importance in the management of primary education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1797">As part of the Programme for Government we are committed to supporting the role of principals through the provision of improved training options for principals, middle management and aspiring school leaders, to increase the number of release days for teaching principals, review the role of middle management in primary schools, to reduce the threshold for the appointment of deputy principals in primary schools, to substantially increase the ancillary services grant so that principals have better administrative support and to maximise the use of IT to cut down on administration and put a database in place to track primary pupils.  The Programme for Government also provides that we will seek agreement through partnership for a facility to allow those who have served as principals for more than a certain number of years to return to full-time teaching duties, while maintaining some benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1798">In the 2005/2006 school year my Department, following consultation with the relevant education interests, including the IPPN, introduced on a pilot basis, a system whereby a fully qualified primary school teacher may be employed to act as nominated substitute teacher for the Principals in a cluster of schools taking release days.  Twenty clusters have been established under the pilot scheme.  The position will be monitored by my Department during the pilot.</p>
            <p eId="para_1799">In November 2006, my Department introduced a free and confidential Employee Assistance Service (EAS) for all teachers including principals.  VHI Corporate Solutions has been contracted by my Department to deliver the service, the purpose of which is to provide teachers, including principals, and their immediate family members with easy access to confidential counselling and to assist in coping with the effect of personal and work related issues.  The service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1800">Since the start of the 2006/07 school year my Department has introduced further initiatives to assist with reducing the workload of primary school principals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">Following the introduction of DEIS in the 2006/07 school year, schools which qualified for the Urban Strand (Band 1 and 2) of the School Support Programme (SSP) are entitled to the allocation of administrative principals on lower enrolment and staffing figures than apply in primary schools generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">Additionally primary schools with a staffing of Principal plus four or five mainstream class teachers that also have a specialist autism unit established under the approval of the National Council for Special Education, are entitled to appoint the Principal on an administrative basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">In the current school year the appointment of Deputy Principals on an administrative (non-teaching) basis was introduced at primary level for the first time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">Schools with 24 or more mainstream class teachers (including Developing School Posts and certain posts allocated under Social Inclusion measures) and mainstream schools that, in addition to ordinary mainstream class teachers, also have five or more special classes for children with more complex, low incidence, special needs can appoint the Deputy Principal on an administrative basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">In all of the above instances, a permanent mainstream class teacher may be appointed to replace the Principal and Deputy Principal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">The existing scheme of release time continues to operate for primary Principals.  This scheme enables teaching principals of primary schools to be released from their teaching duties for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative leadership and management functions.  The number of days release time allowed varies between 14 and 22 and is determined by the number of mainstream class teachers in the school.  Paid substitution is provided by my Department for the days that principals are on release time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1809">The initiative for an amalgamation may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, boards of management and the Patron.

My Department's role is to facilitate any such proposals or discussions between the relevant parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">Where additional/replacement accommodation is required officials in my Department carry out an assessment of the long term projected staffing for the amalgamating schools and notifies this to the school authorities.

            <p eId="para_1814">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special needs supports such as resource teaching hours and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs.  SNA support in schools is intended to address the care needs of pupils with special educational needs. In many cases the SNA will be providing care to help with toileting and feeding and it would be expected that very often this level of care should diminish as the child matures.  Where a pupil in receipt of SNA support transfers from one school to another, the care needs of the pupil concerned will be examined in the context of the overall allocation already in the school.  This may mean that the SNA support required can be met from within the existing allocation.</p>

         if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the value of the full maintenance grant for third level students at €4,320 a year is unrealistic for any student studying and living in the Greater Dublin Area where independent estimates suggest that the real cost should be closer to €9,500 per year; and if she will make a statement on her proposals to increase the standard and top up grants to match social welfare levels.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1823">I propose to take Questions Nos. 123, 126 and 166 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">It has been the practice in recent years to increase the level of maintenance grants annually, at least in line with inflation.  Under the 2007 schemes, however, I secured approval for a 10% increase in the standard rate of student grant for the academic year 2007/08.  This very substantial increase, at twice the rate of inflation, will assist in meeting the costs associated with attending higher and further education for over 56,000 students who receive a maintenance grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">This has resulted in an increase in the maximum rate of ordinary grant to €3,420 for 2007/08 and students who qualify will also have the student service charge paid on their behalf.  In addition, over 13,200 students in receipt of the Special Rate of maintenance grant have benefited from an even more substantial increase of over 14%, with the maximum rate for 2007/08 increasing to €6,690.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students and to consolidate the administration of this unified grants scheme in the VEC sector.  This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administrative system.  The scheme, which will be underpinned by a new Student Support Bill, will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and timely delivery of grants.  As the Deputy is aware the Student Support Bill was published recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">Under my Department's student maintenance grant schemes, I am committed to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes including increasing the rates and income limits, as resources permit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">In addition in publicly funded third level institutions there is a Student Assistance Fund (SAF).  The objective of the SAF is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, because of financial reasons, suffer severe hardship or be unable to continue their third level studies.  Applications for funding should be made by the individual student to the Access Officer in their institution.  The SAF is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">Another initiative under the Third Level Access Fund is the Millennium Partnership Fund for Disadvantage.  It supports students from disadvantaged areas with regard to retention and participation in further or higher education courses.  Information on Partnership/Community Groups can be obtained at An Pobal.</p>

            <p eId="para_1831">The Towards 2016 Agreement contains a commitment to put in place a targeted scheme to alleviate the fees in public institutions for part-time courses at third level for those at work who have not previously pursued a third level qualification.  In relation to the implementation of this commitment, the HEA has developed proposals for a Modular Accreditation Programme (MAP) that could be delivered on a flexible part time basis through a number of third level institutions.  Students participating in the programme will benefit from a substantial fee subsidy.  A pilot Modular Accreditation Programme commenced in Tallaght IOT in October 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">The Higher Certificate in Good Manufacturing Practice and Technology, to be awarded at HETAC Level 6, will focus on providing education and training in fundamental and applied aspects of science and good manufacturing practice relevant to the pharma/healthcare industry.  It is proposed to launch a number of additional Modular Accreditation programmes in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">Students pursuing approved part time undergraduate courses are eligible for tax relief on their fees.  The Strategic Innovation Fund which the Government introduced to incentivise reform and modernisation of higher education also provide opportunities for institutions to review their structures to provide better opportunities for part-time provision.  For example, in the institute of technology sector, Cork IT is leading a project to enhance opportunities for people in employment to access learning to enhance their skills for current and future occupations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1834">The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to introduce a more extensive new system of means-tested free fees, with a view to enabling more people with work or family commitments to avail of opportunities at third level.  The timescale for implementing this commitment will depend on the resources available in future Budgets.</p>

Those schools with very high water consumption will be identified and contacted with a view to introducing measures to help them reduce water usage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1873">My Department and the Department of Education Northern Ireland co-operate under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council in a number of areas within the education sector including the area of teacher mobility and qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1874">Issues in relation to the recognition and registration of teachers in this jurisdiction are a matter for the Teaching Council. Teachers registered in Northern Ireland are currently eligible for registration as teachers with the Teaching Council subject to conditions relating to the Irish language requirement and probation. Holders of provisional recognition must meet the Irish Language requirement in order to be granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. In addition, they must provide certification that they have attended an approved course in the Gaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_1875">Further, under the EU Directives for the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications, provisions are made whereby professionals qualified in one (home) Member State can seek professional recognition of their qualifications in another (host) Member State for the purpose of practising their profession in that host Member State. These Directives apply only where the profession is regulated in the host Member State, as teaching is in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1876">The Teaching Council and the General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland (GTCNI) are the designated competent authorities for the recognition and assessment of qualifications and registration of teachers at Primary and Post Primary levels. The Teaching Council has a statutory responsibility to cooperate with its equivalent organisation in Northern Ireland (the GTCNI) and there is an ongoing relationship between the two Councils. Issues in relation to the mutual recognition of qualifications between Ireland North and South may be advanced as appropriate in this context.</p>

        <b>Deputy Denis Naughten</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the additional resources she will provide to address the language needs of non-Irish students; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1878">In May 2007, the Minister approved the issuing of Circular 53/2007 to the Managerial Authorities in primary and post primary schools. This circular outlines the resources available to meet the needs of pupils for whom English is a second language. The limit of two Language Support Teachers per school has been removed and the provision of language support has been extended beyond two years, where a specific request is made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1879">In fact, it is now possible for some schools with over 121 such pupils to have 6 language support teachers. There are now over 1,900 language support teacher posts allocated to primary and post primary schools, compared with just over 260 in 2001/2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1880">In addition to the language resource teachers there is a significant amount of resources available including the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's (NCCA) Guidelines — "Intercultural Education in the Primary School" and "Intercultural Education in the Post- Primary school". The NCCA has also published "English as an Additional Language in Irish Primary Schools". Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT) has produced a resource book "Up and Away" for English language support in primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1881">IILT in collaboration with the  Southern Education and Library Board (in Armagh) published a "Toolkit for diversity in the primary school — Together towards Inclusion". This was a joint North South project. It was completed in December 2007 and is currently  being distributed to all schools on the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_1882">In addition, a language assessment kit, prepared by IILT, will be provided to all primary schools just after Easter. This will enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of newcomer children. It is proposed to have an assessment kit for post-primary schools available later in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1883">To ensure the language provision is appropriate to meet the needs of newcomer students, the Department has commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) to undertake a large scale study into how an increasing diversity of students impacts upon the resource requirements and day to day teaching and learning in our primary and post-primary schools. Also, the Department's Inspectorate will be carrying out an evaluation on the teaching of English as a second language in Primary and Post Primary schools in 2008/2009. At an international level, Ireland has signed up to be a participant in the  OECD's Thematic Review on Migrant Education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1884">The findings from these three research projects will enable the Department to determine if the additional resources being provided are addressing the language needs of the students for whom English is not their first language.</p>

         if she will provide ABA in-service training for special needs teachers in mainstream schools; her views on whether there are many children in the autism spectrum that can not be adequately educated in a mainstream school; and her proposals to provide the special education needed outside the catchment area of the existing 12 ABA schools.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_542">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1886">The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism, receive an education appropriate to their needs. In relation to specific provision for children with autism, my Department considers that as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. Appropriate placement options include enrolment in mainstream school, with or without support, enrolment in a special autism class attached to a mainstream school or in an autism class attached to a special school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887">In terms of autism provision across the country, my Department will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for particular methodologies as appropriate, in special classes. In excess of 277 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country, while more are being set up all the time. The National Council for Special Education will continue to expand the number of such classes as necessary to meet demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">Children with autism in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA, TEACCH and PECS. The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for the Government. Children in special classes attached to mainstream schools also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1889">I am pleased to inform the Deputy of the significant level of training provided for teachers via the Special Education Support Service established by my Department in a variety of fields in relation to Autistic Spectrum Disorder. The approaches include Language and Communication Approaches, Managing Inclusion, Curriculum Access for Pupils with General Learning Disabilities and Autism, Sensory Integration, PECS, TEACCH, Social Stories, and Applied Behavioural Analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1890">In terms of Applied Behavioural Analysis, a variety of courses were provided in 2007, such as:</p>
            <p eId="para_1891">Contemporary Applied Behaviour Analysis (10-week course)</p>
            <p eId="para_1892">Applied Behaviour Analysis (2-day)</p>
            <p eId="para_1893">Applied Behaviour Analysis (Online (ICEPE))</p>
            <p eId="para_1894">The first two courses above were delivered by the Specialist Behaviour team appointed by my Department in 2007. This team, which is headed by a person with a PhD in ABA, will be expanded in 2008 and will continue to consolidate teachers' knowledge and skills in the application of behavioural principles to learning. In addition my Department provides funding for ABA consultancy to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1895">Training in strategies of Applied Behaviour Analysis is also provided as part of the Department funded Combined Post-Graduate Diploma Programme of Continuous Professional Development for Teachers involved in Learning Support and Special Education. Seven colleges throughout the country provide this course which includes consideration of the application of behavioural principles to learning and familiarise teachers with the use of these principles. 300 places are provided on these courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1896">As well as the above mentioned Diploma, my Department's Teacher Education Section also fund a Certificate in Autistic Spectrum Disorder for teachers and an online Diploma course delivered jointly by the Institute of Child Education and Psychology, Europe (ICEPE) and the St Patrick's College, Drumcondra. The course content of the Certificate Programme for Autistic Spectrum Disorders in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra provides teachers with training in all evidence-based approaches to meeting the needs of children with autism including Applied Behaviour Analysis. The course provides 18 places per year for teachers. My Department previously funded 75 teachers to take a distance education programme in Autism of the  University of Birmingham.  The Online programme provided by the Institute of Child Education and Psychology, Europe (ICEPE) and the St Patrick's College, Drumcondra is currently rolling out modules and will provide a dedicated module in Applied Behaviour Analysis from 2009. This course will provide 150 places when it is rolled out in full.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         if she is satisfied that the present provision for physical education in both primary and post-primary school is adequate to combat the growing obesity crisis and the poor posture of many of the school going population; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1898">Physical education is a core part of the curriculum at primary level, and at post primary level all schools are required to offer physical education. A revised Junior Cycle Physical Education syllabus was introduced in 2003, and the Leaving Certificate syllabus in PE and the Health and Leisure module of the Leaving Certificate Applied programme are also available. In addition, Social Personal and Health Education which is mandatory at primary and junior cycle level stresses the importance of regular exercise, and the need for a balanced diet as essential to physical and mental well being.</p>
            <p eId="para_1899">Schools also play a major role in nurturing and promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport. The Irish Sports Council, in co-operation with bodies such as the FAI and Local Sports Partnerships, has developed a national Buntús Primary Schools Initiative through which additional supports — training, resource cards and equipment — are provided to support teachers and others in introducing young people to sport, and to complement the Physical Education curriculum. The initiative aims to raise the profile of physical activity and sport, improve inservice training opportunities for teachers, assist governing bodies of sport to develop and deliver appropriate supports for teachers, and provide enjoyable and meaningful activity for children which supports the delivery of the curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1900">For practising teachers, curriculum support services at primary and second level provide training and school based support for teachers. School-based support is a very rich form of support and allows the teacher explore the possibilities and limitations of the environment in which they teach. Through modelling of lessons and professional dialogue, the quality of teaching is enhanced and teachers are further enabled to develop their teaching skills. Teachers must also aim to include all students in PE lessons — irrespective of gender, or physical and/or learning deficits. The Irish Primary PE Association and the PE Association of Ireland (Subject Associations) have been active in organising conferences where teachers can avail of an opportunity to witness the latest thinking in physical education, and my Department also funds programmes on PE through the network of education centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_1901">The Primary Curriculum Support Programme (PCSP) and the School Development Planning Support (SDPS) have prepared planning templates (with prompts) for schools to assist them in school planning for the implementation of the PE Curriculum and the wider aspects of physical activity and school sport. A key element of this approach is aimed at ensuring that gender and intercultural issues are addressed, and that PE is accessible to all, irrespective of gender or physical or learning abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1902">This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities. In a new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as part of the design. Between 2000 and 2006 a total of 516 large-scale projects were delivered in primary and post-primary schools by the Department as part of a record overall investment of €2.6 billion in modernising primary and post-primary school facilities throughout the country. Many more large-scale projects are under construction or due to go to construction in the near future. New PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme. The Department also provided €6.5m in 2006 and €3m in 2007 for primary and post primary schools respectively, for replacement and updating of PE equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1903">So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we are working to encourage more children and young people to get active. Indeed, the ‘State of the Nation's Children' report published by the Minister for Children recently, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.</p>

            <p eId="para_1905">The salaries and allowances of school principals at both primary and post-primary level were considered by the Public Service Benchmarking Body, which has recently made recommendations in relation to these grades. The Benchmarking Body is recommending an increase in the allowances paid to primary principals, which will result in primary school principals receiving allowances in the range of €12,261 to €31, 580 in addition to their pay and other allowances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1906">It was noted in the submissions made to the Benchmarking Body that principal teachers in smaller schools with 1-7 teachers were required to combine full teaching duties with the administrative duties as principal. The Body, in making its award recognised this by adjusting the relative position of principals in primary schools with the position of principals of post primary schools. The largest adjustments are in respect of principals in the smaller primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1907">The implementation of the Benchmarking Report is now a matter for discussion in the course of the forthcoming talks on arrangements to succeed the current pay agreement under Towards 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1908">As the Benchmarking Body is the appropriate body for reviewing public service pay, there are no plans at present to further review the structure of the pay scales for school principals at primary level.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1914">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) was established under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1915">To discharge its responsibilities, the Board is developing a nationwide service on a continuing basis that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board's functions locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">I have been informed by the Board that recruitment for an additional 15 staff which were allocated to the NEWB during 2007 is ongoing and will be finalised shortly. This allocation brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are working directly in the service delivery area. The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 Regional Managers, 13 Senior EWO's and 72 EWO's. The financial allocation to the Board in 2008 is €10.119 million. These extra resources will continue to strengthen the NEWB to deliver services locally and contribute to improving the coverage in respect of those services provided by the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1917">In respect of the Deputy's specific question relating to Co.Donegal, the Board currently has the services of one Educational Welfare Officer in the county. As I informed the deputy in reply to a Parliamentary Question which he tabled last November,  it is still the Board's intention to deploy another Welfare Officer in Co. Donegal when the additional 15 staff, referred to earlier, have been appointed. The ongoing allocation of posts will continue to be evaluated by the Board in light of operational experience and identified need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">It must be remembered also that the service provided by the NEWB is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to support schools, families and young people themselves. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and the provision of breakfast and homework clubs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 620 staff within the education sector in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Completion Programme (SCP) is a preventative measure designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving. School attendance is a central objective of SCP with targeted interventions for children at risk of early school leaving through a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. These supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) works to involve parents in their children's education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">Work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration. This approach aims to develop the delivery of services in a cohesive way and ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed. I will be keeping the issue of the NEWB's staffing under review in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1922">The budget for 2007 was the first year of the rollout of the new NDP 2007-2013 which will involve an investment of over €4.5 billion in school building infrastructure over the coming years to ensure that school places are available where needed. This investment will be the largest in the history of the State and will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation particularly in developing areas and the upgrade of existing accommodation. The main focus of the school building programme for 2008 and subsequent years is to deliver additional capacity in the rapidly developing areas. I am conscious of the need to provide more school places quickly and these are being delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1923">Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest time-frame possible. My Department has also improved forward planning through greater cooperation between the Department of Education and Local Authorities and the publication of 10-year Area Development Plans.</p>

            <p eId="para_1925">I launched Webwise, the internet safety initiative which was developed by the National Centre for Technology in Education in February, 2006. The Webwise website, www.webwise.ie, provides information and resources in four specific areas, surfing, chatting, sharing and gaming to teachers, parents and students to help ensure that children and young people have positive and safe on-line experiences. The NCTE published the Webwise Internet Safety Education Pack which was distributed to schools in March 2007. This pack is designed as an adaptive resource to enable individual schools to be proactive in the area of internet safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_1926">The NCTE's watchyourspace.ie website offers practical tips and advice and supports teenagers who use the web. A key feature is the advice given by teenagers to teenagers on how to cope with the fall-out from abuses and misuse of social networking and picture-sharing websites. It has presentations of the key findings from studies of teenagers' use of the Internet by other teenagers and is integrated with an on-line helpline service from Childline. The website was promoted through a poster campaign in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1927">The NCTE has worked in collaboration with the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) Support Service to create the Internet Safety teaching and learning programme, Be SAFE_Be WEBWISE.  This programme, which is the first educational programme of its kind in Europe, is designed to address the personal safety needs of our young people when on-line and to help them become safe and responsible Internet users for life.  The programme consists of a Teachers' Internet Safety Lesson and Resource Pack for 1st, 2nd and 3rd Year Junior Certificate SPHE classes and in-service training for SPHE teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1928">Working with the National Parents Council (Primary) the NCTE has developed a seminar to take the mystery out of the Internet for parents and to give them the skills to engage with their children's on-line lives. So far over 40 tutors have been trained to deliver this seminar and over 100 schools have applied to avail of the initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1929">The NCTE's Teaching Skills Initiative offers a range of Internet safety courses for both primary and post-primary teachers. These courses provide teachers with advice and strategies for developing safe approaches to teaching and learning while using the Internet and give teachers' practical experience in taking internet safety precautions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1930">The Internet Advisory Board, of which the NCTE is a member, has produced two booklets on internet safety.  My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Brian Lenihan T.D. launched last Monday 18th February their new publication ‘Get with IT — A parents' guide to social-networking websites'.  This launch took place in conjunction with the makeITsecure 2008 campaign, the aim of which is to drive awareness among citizens of the most common security risks related to accessing and transacting on the internet.</p>
            <p eId="para_1931">The Schools Broadband Programme provides broadband internet access to Primary and Post Primary schools and includes Content Filtering as an integral part of the service. The Content Filtering service is designed to control the level of access from schools, via the broadband network, to the wider internet. No school is connected to the internet via the schools broadband network unless it has confirmed that an Internet Acceptable Usage Policy is in place and it has selected a Content Filtering option.</p>

However, as the Deputy may be aware, at an Institutional Format meeting of 30 October 2007 the North/South Ministerial Council considered the issue of cross-border pensions mobility and agreed that the Joint Secretariat should convene a working group of officials from relevant Government Departments to explore options for going forward on the transfer of pension rights on a cross-border basis. That working group met in Armagh on 10 January this year and work is now being undertaken to gather evidence on difficulties experienced by teachers in moving between the jurisdictions  North and South  as a result of the inability to transfer pension entitlements. The working group is scheduled to reconvene in March.</p>

            <p eId="para_1940">A number of steps are being taken to ensure we continue to build on the success of the previous Programme for Government and National Development Plan (2000-2006) in achieving further increases in participation in third level education by young people and adults from disadvantaged groups and areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1941">The first step is the significant commitment of resources over a seven year period for a number of key measures under the Social Inclusion and Human Capital Priorities of the current National Development Plan 2007-13.  The second step is the actions associated with the implementation of those measures by a range of personnel in the further and higher education sector, schools, community agencies, as well as officials in my Department and the Higher Education Authority.  Over the seven years of the NDP €13 billion will be invested under the Human Capital Priority towards developing the capacity of our higher education institutions to meet a number of key national objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1942">The key objective of third level access programmes is to encourage more young people and adults from disadvantaged schools and areas in continuing or re-engaging with education.  The strategic planning and development of our higher education institutions is also being supported by the allocations that are being made through the Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF).  In addition to the core funding of higher education institutions, over €510 million will be allocated to third level institutions through the SIF.</p>
            <p eId="para_1943">The Social Inclusion Priority of the NDP commits that €2 billion will be dedicated over the period 2007-13 to address inequities in participation by students from socio-economically disadvantaged groups (including members of the travelling community and refugees), students with a disability and mature students.  This funding underpins the allocations that will be made through the Higher Education Grant scheme (including the ‘Special Rates of Grant') as well as the significant reforms to the existing maintenance grant schemes that are proposed by the recently published Student Support Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1944">This priority also encompasses the Third Level Access Sub-Programme, which includes the annual allocations through three funds: the Fund for Students with a Disability, the Student Assistance Fund and the Millennium Partnership Fund.</p>

It is intended the remaining projects should be completed where possible before the end of this year. Around €175m has been approved for the scheme since inception.  With so many small projects having been approved over the past few years, I have decided to focus primarily on delivering as many large scale projects as possible in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1964">This Government has pursued a dual strategy of both encouraging more young people to finish school and ensuring much greater second chance and further education opportunities for those who left school early. This has led to an increase in the proportion of young people with at least the Leaving Certificate or equivalent, as well as improving the educational profile of 20-24 year olds through increased opportunities in the further education and training sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1967">Following the formation of the ad-hoc National Adult Learning Council in 2002, concerns emerged that the functions envisaged for it were too wide-ranging and were not sufficiently focused. Additionally, a number of developments had occurred which would impact on its work. Therefore, a strategic review of the role and functions of the Council was undertaken to address these concerns. The outcome of the review has been under consideration in my Department and a decision on the best way forward is due to be made shortly, taking full account of existing  provision and structures.</p>

            <p eId="para_1971">The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children including those with special needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and postprimary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who have received additional training in autism, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of methods so their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">In excess of 275 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level by my Department in conjunction with National Council for Special Education (NCSE), while more are being set up as required.  At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants.  Extra assistants are provided where the children need them on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">My Department is currently funding a number of ABA pilot schemes which were established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools.  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot programme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable the Department to support them as primary schools for children with autism.  I am pleased to advise that the issue is being actively progressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1974">In terms of autism provision in other locations, including Co. Kerry, we will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for ABA as appropriate, in special classes.  However, now that a national network of special classes is available, new centres will not be brought into the pilot programme.  My Department is determined to ensure that each child has access to the autism-specific education that is now being made available to schools throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1978">My Department has no plans to introduce classroom assistants for classes with twenty pupils or more.  The mainstream teacher allocation of all primary schools, is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year.  The staffing schedule is outlined in a circular which is issued annually to all primary schools.  In addition such schools may be eligible for additional teacher or special needs assistant allocations in accordance with the criteria for the allocation of special needs resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1979">Special needs assistant support in schools is allocated based on the assessed care needs of one or more children with special educational needs.  As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are now in the region of 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002.  By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc.  In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1980">Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1981">A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.</p>
            <p eId="para_1982">The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years in order to reduce class sizes.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_1984">The salaries and allowances of school principals at both primary and post-primary level were considered by the Public Service Benchmarking Body, which has recently made recommendations in relation to these grades.  The Benchmarking Body is recommending an increase in the allowances paid to primary principals, which will result in primary school principals receiving allowances in the range of €12,261 to €31, 580 in addition to their pay and other allowances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1985">It was noted in the submissions made to the Benchmarking Body that principal teachers in smaller schools with 1-7 teachers were required to combine full teaching duties with the administrative duties as principal.  The Body, in making its award recognised this by adjusting the relative position of principals in primary schools with the position of principals of post primary schools.  The largest adjustments are in respect of principals in the smaller primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1986">The implementation of the Benchmarking Report is now a matter for discussion in the course of the forthcoming talks on arrangements to succeed the current pay agreement under Towards 2016.  As the Benchmarking Body is the appropriate body for reviewing public service pay, there are no plans at present to further review the structure of the pay scales for school principals at primary level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1988">Bus Éireann operates the school transport services on behalf of my Department.  It is a major logistical operation which involves the planning of bus routes in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible pupils have a reasonable level of service while, at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in an efficient and effective manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 2.4 kilometres to travel to a pick-up point.  Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.  Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the School Transport Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1990">Safety of children travelling on the school transport service is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann. Bus Éireann place special emphasis on safety and, to this end, have a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure that a safe and reliable service is provided.  The designation of specific school bus pick-up points is an operational matter for Bus Éireann. I should say, however, that parents and guardians also have to play their part in ensuring that children are brought to and collected safely from relevant pick up points along the route of the journey.</p>

The taxable component is that part of the payment which is based on a fisherman's catch and is taxable on recipients in the year of receipt.  Accordingly, commercial fishermen should include this part of any payment as a receipt in their accounts.  The part of the payment which is based on the 2006 licence fee is not liable to tax.  I understand that when making payments Bord Iascaigh Mhara identify the amount of the payment relating to the 2006 licence fee so that this may be excluded from income tax returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_2307">I am also informed that to facilitate recipients wishing to spread the taxable amount over three years, eligible applicants may opt under the scheme to receive their payment in one sum or alternatively to have it paid in three equal amounts over a three-year period.</p>

            <p eId="para_2313">Responsibility for the administration of the various tax clearance schemes is assigned in legislation to the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised by Revenue that there has been no change in the policy with regard to the automatic renewal of tax clearance certificates to either sole traders or limited companies.  As part of Revenue's ongoing commitment to developing simplified processes and procedures and reducing the regulatory burden on business and personal taxpayers, a facility was introduced some time ago to automatically renew tax clearance certificates for compliant taxpayers. This service is particularly useful for persons tendering for public contracts or renewing licences annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_2314">A taxpayer whose tax affairs are in order, is issued with tax clearance certificates each year for a period of three years after the issue of the original certificate. The taxpayer is not required to re-apply during this period. Prior to the expiry date of the fourth tax clearance certificate, Revenue notifies the taxpayer that s/he needs to complete an updated application form in order to renew their tax clearance certificate.</p>

I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that a very high volume of returns are received by Revenue at that time of year.

            <p eId="para_2336">The Primary Care Strategy aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others. It has been estimated that up to 95% of people's health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">The HSE received additional funding of €40m in the period 2006 to 2008 for the establishment of some 200 primary care teams involving some 600 additional front line professionals. The Government has committed under the Towards 2016 agreement to the establishment of 300 Primary Care teams by 2008; 400 by 2009 and 500 by 2011. A review of these targets is due to be undertaken in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">Action 19 of the Primary Care Strategy commits to the involvement of communities and service users in the planning and delivery of primary care services. It is important that the HSE develops practical and effective ways to bring this about. The recruitment pause put in place in September 2007 was initiated as part of the HSE financial break-even plan to facilitate the delivery of services on budget in accordance with the provisions of the 2007 National Service Plan.  During this period, the HSE put in place a derogation process to deal with the filling of essential posts to protect front-line services and close to 900 posts were approved under this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">I understand that this temporary pause in recruitment ended on 31st December 2007 and that recruitment of the additional staff for the 2006 phase of Primary Care Team development is proceeding subject to the provisions of the  employment control mechanism operated by the HSE. As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care Services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matters raised by the Deputy.

It has been estimated that when the first Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre is developed at Tallaght it will cater for approximately 48,000 emergency attendances, 9,000 day cases and 58,000 out-patient attendances.

            <p eId="para_2530">My Department had discussions recently with the EU Commission about air connectivity from the West of Ireland and in particular about the possible imposition of a Public Service Obligation (PSO) on the Shannon-Heathrow route.  The Commission's position, as clarified following those discussions, is that the EU Regulation governing PSOs is an exception to the general rule of free provision of air services and that any such exception should be considered as restrictively as possible and applied only as far as necessary.  In order for a route to be eligible for a PSO, under the Regulation it must not only be vital for the economic development of the region concerned but the existing services must be inadequate.  In assessing whether services are adequate, account has to be taken of all existing air transport services, direct and indirect.</p>
            <p eId="para_2531">In relation to the Shannon to London route, the Commission has noted that there are already regular direct air services between Shannon and the London airports of Gatwick, Stansted and Luton.  Allowing for these connections, the Commission has indicated that it would be difficult to justify a PSO on the Shannon to London route.</p>

The site has been identified as an important site from a business and employment perspective for both Co. Limerick and the wider Region in the Planning and Land Use Transportation Study, the Mid-West Regional Planning Guidelines and the Limerick County Development Plan.

            <p eId="para_2639">Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the HSE, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.  Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment.  Non payment of rent is not a case for making an exceptional needs payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2640">The Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned is in receipt of a rent supplement (in addition to a one parent family payment) at the maximum rate payable appropriate to her circumstances.  The net disposable income of the person concerned has not changed since the last review of her entitlements in May 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2641">The Executive have further stated that the person concerned, on the advice of the Community Welfare Officer (CWO), met with a representative of the local Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), in January 2008 and also in early February 2008, in order to discuss her current financial situation with a view to arranging a resolution to the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2642">Additionally, the CWO wrote to the person concerned on 12 February 2008 to make an appointment to consider her present circumstances.  To date the person concerned has not contacted the CWO.</p>

            <p eId="para_2644">Grants in respect of personal alarm systems are available for senior citizens as part of my Department's ‘Scheme of Community Support for Older People'.</p>
            <p eId="para_2645">The funding available under the Scheme (maximum amounts) is as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2646">€300 in respect of the once-off cost of installing a socially monitored alarm system;</p>
            <p eId="para_2647">€200 in respect of physical security equipment;</p>
            <p eId="para_2648">€200 in respect of security lighting;</p>

            <p eId="para_2650">€150 in respect of interior emergency lighting for qualifying older people on our offshore islands.</p>
            <p eId="para_2651">The Scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.  Individual applicants must be over 65 years of age and have a genuine need for the security equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2652">In the case of the alarm systems, the maximum grant provided is fixed at a realistic sum on the basis of grants sought and disbursed in the previous year by my Department.  I understand that a number of the private commercial suppliers of socially monitored alarm systems quote prices of under €300 for the supply and installation of the equipment.  The ongoing monitoring costs charged by the suppliers are approximately €80 per annum per individual and, given that the Scheme has benefited as many as 100,000 older people, the costs to my Department of providing funding for all such monitoring costs would be considerable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2653">It is my view that available resources are best directed towards continuing to fund the installation costs of personal alarms systems to those older members of the community in need of such assistance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2673">As the Deputy is aware, in many rural areas, there are no public transport services at night.

The new Scheme also aims to address the market failure that currently exists in this area.</p>

Although only in the early stages yet, I understand that the services are being very well received by communities and passengers alike.  Indications are that older people, people with a disability and young people are particularly enthusiastic about the new services and new activities are being planned around the availability of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2684">All services focus on maximising the general community good and I am, of course, conscious of the need to ensure that no displacement takes place of commercially viable existing services as a result of the introduction of the new scheme.</p>

Investments included purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.  He applied under Category B(iv) in relation to other investments.

Their existing Single Payment must be less than €6,000 and the value of individual payment entitlements must be less than the District Electoral Division (DED) average value.

        <b>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         her views on the analysis in the paper Profile of Basic Running Costs in Primary Schools that the capitation grant covers approximately 50% of the school running cost (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_632">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2763">I am aware of the funding pressures on schools generally and it is a key priority for the Government to improve funding for the day-to-day running costs of schools.  For that reason specific commitments in relation to improving school funding form a central part of the education provisions in the Programme for Government.  These commitments are a direct follow on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of primary schools in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_2764">In 2008 alone my Department will be paying around €167m to primary schools to meet their day to day running costs.  The improvements announced in the last budget mean that the combined day-to-day funding for primary schools will increase by €21 to €330 per pupil.  As a result, a primary school with 300 pupils will receive almost €100,000 to meet their running costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2765">The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years.  Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €178.58 from 1st January, 2008.  This represents an increase of 212% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_2766">Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from €457.00 to €880 per pupil — an increase of 42% from the rate in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2767">The analysis referred to by the Deputy involves just 5 schools.  There are clear limitations in extrapolating a general position for all 3,200 primary schools from such a limited sample.  However, I agree that increases in primary capitation must be a priority and that is why we are committed to doubling it by 2012.  This year, despite the overall difficult economic environment I delivered an increase of €15 per pupil on capitation levels in 2008.  I want to assure the Deputy that this Government has a track record of significantly increasing funding for schools and we will continue to build on this and deliver on our Programme for Government commitment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2772">As the Deputy is aware, I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students and to consolidate the administration of this unified grants scheme in the VEC sector.  This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administrative system.  The scheme, which will be underpinned by the recently published Student Support Bill, will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and timely delivery of grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2773">I want to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements and, in this regard, I intend to continue the existing arrangements for the 2008/09 academic year.  While the existing arrangements will continue to apply for 2008/09, I hope to be in a position very shortly to announce more immediate service level improvements by publishing the student grant schemes for the coming academic year some months ahead of their publication in previous years.  I am pleased to advise you that the application forms for the 2008/09 academic year are available on my Department's website for information purposes and hard copies will be available in local authorities and VECs within the next week.</p>

            <p eId="para_2880">The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism, receive an education appropriate to their needs. In relation to specific provision for children with autism, my Department considers that as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. Appropriate placement options include enrolment in mainstream school, with or without support, enrolment in a special autism class attached to a mainstream school or in an autism class in a special school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2881">In terms of autism provision across the country, my Department will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for particular methodologies as appropriate, in special classes. In excess of 277 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country, while more are being set up all the time. The National Council for Special Education will continue to expand the number of such classes as necessary to meet demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_2882">In relation to associated facilities the Deputy will be aware that during the period of the last National Development Plan 2000-2006 my Department accelerated the school building programme with record levels of investment and the streamlining of delivery systems. An aggregate total of well over €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second-level, including the provision of facilities for autism and other special needs pupils. This programme delivered over 7,800 building projects. The overall investment in school building infrastructure over the lifetime of the new NDP will be €4.5 billion, including almost €600 million for the school building programme in 2008. Generally projects required for special needs pupils receive a high degree of priority in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2885">I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 269 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2886">As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2887">In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2888">During 2006/07 the DES through NEPS funded some 4,260 psychological assessments under the SCPA.  In this period NEPS psychologists undertook referrals in respect of over 5,700 named pupils and almost 2,800 cases under the Reasonable Accommodation for Certificate Examinations (RACE) scheme on behalf of the State Examinations Commission.  In addition it is estimated that NEPS psychologists gave consultations, advice and assistance to teachers and school authorities in respect of an additional 5,000 unnamed pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_2889">Since May 2007 the number of psychologists employed within the NEPS service has increased from 128 to 138 and during 2008 this complement will increase to 169. In this regard, following a national recruitment process put in place in late 2007 by the Public Appointments Service, interviews are currently being held to form regional panels from which appointments to priority regions will be made. As I have previously stated, and in line with Government commitments under the T2016 Agreement, it is further my intention to increase NEPS psychologist personnel to 200 during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2890">My Department, and this Government, is committed to the maintenance of a robust psychological service based on international practice.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2892">The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas, including the impact of immigration, and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools. Major progress has been made in meeting all of those needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2893">We have dramatically increased investment in the school building programme in recent years. During the period of the last National Development Plan 2000-2006 my Department accelerated the school building programme with record levels of investment and the streamlining of delivery systems. An aggregate total of well over €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second-level. This programme delivered over 7,800 building projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2894">The budget for 2007 was the first year of the rollout of the new NDP 2007-2013 which will involve an investment of over €4.5 billion, including almost €600 million this year, in school building infrastructure over the coming years to ensure that school places are available where needed. This investment will be the largest in the history of the State and will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation particularly in developing areas and the upgrade of existing accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2895">A key priority of the programme in 2008 and subsequent years will be the delivery of additional capacity in the rapidly developing areas. I am conscious of the need to provide more school places in these areas quickly and these are being delivered. New schools have been built in rapidly developing areas and more are planned to accommodate continuing demographic changes. Many schools have had extensions built. Major refurbishments of schools have also been undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_2896">Not only are we investing far more in school buildings, but the improvements that have been made in the planning, design and delivery processes are also helping to deliver projects much faster. There is now much greater forward-planning, with close and regular engagement with local authorities, while a new partnership model has been developed to deliver community facilities in tandem with new schools and the publication of 10-year Area Development Plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_2897">In my most recent announcement on the 2008 large-scale building programme, I approved 48 projects to commence construction including 30 new primary schools in rapidly developing areas that are planned to be in place by next September under an accelerated building programme. It is also intended to provide additional accommodation at a number of schools under this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2898">My Department also has other projects coming on stream to the tendering and construction stages and I will be making further announcements about these as the 2008 school building programme is rolled out.</p>
            <p eId="para_2899">I assure the Deputy that through both increased investment under the NDP and the improved planning and delivery processes that we have put in place in recent years, the Government will ensure that school accommodation needs will be met.</p>

            <p eId="para_2902">Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.</p>

            <p eId="para_2922">I assure the Deputy that every effort is made by the Department to keep expenditure on prefabricated accommodation as low as possible.  Where accommodation is needed at very short notice, however, a temporary solution can be the only option. Such accommodation may also be used where the need is short-term, such as when a school requires a temporary building while it is awaiting the completion of construction of permanent facilities. Last year, only 5% of the total investment in school buildings went on the rental of temporary accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2923">This year nearly €600 million will be invested in school buildings and construction work will take place which is expected to provide permanent accommodation for about 20,000 pupils when complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_2924">The Deputy will be aware that in the past newly-recognised schools have generally had to open in temporary accommodation. I have been anxious to move away from this approach in developing areas and this year we are working hard to open as many new schools as possible in permanent accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2925">Department officials have been working in partnership with local authority staff to acquire sites needed for new schools next September.  Considerable effort has also been invested in pre-planning discussions with a view to ironing out any difficulties that might otherwise have been experienced at planning permission stage. I also held very productive meetings with a number of county managers and their senior planners and appreciate the effort that they have put into working with us on this.  Sites for each of the September 2008 projects have been identified and site master-plans have been developed by the technical teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_2926">Our aim, where possible, is to put permanent solutions in place on a phased basis to meet the immediate September 2008 needs with a second phase to follow as required. Permanent solutions will be possible where a long-term site has been secured.  A significant amount of building work on the new schools is being done off-site. The successful tenderers for the construction of each individual project have been notified. Project teams which were recruited from the private sector in October 2007 have been tasked with preparing the planning applications, undertaking the necessary surveys and overseeing the delivery of the schools on each site.</p>
            <p eId="para_2927">To conclude, expenditure on temporary accommodation has tended to represent a very small proportion of the overall investment in school buildings in recent years. The use of prefabs is avoided where possible but sometimes they can be the only feasible option. And we are now working to ensure that, where possible, new schools in developing areas will open in permanent accommodation from the start.</p>

            <p eId="para_2961">The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2962">Under the terms of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, one of the functions of the Board is to conduct and commission research into the reasons for non-attendance on the part of students and into the strategies and programmes designed to prevent it. Ongoing activities of the Board include the development of a Code of Behaviour and Attendance Strategies for Schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2963">The first national data on school attendance has been collected and is being used to inform the Board's work. In relation to the effectiveness of the service, it is encouraging to note research findings indicate that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved with the mean percentage of students absent 20 days or more having decreased by over 4% in 2004/05 compared with the previous year. The NEWB collects data for absences over 20 days. The first year data collected on an individual county basis was for the 2004/05 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2964">In relation to the Deputy's specific question relating to student absenteeism in the Cork South West constituency, I am informed that data in the format requested is not available on the basis of constituency breakdown.  There is however data available for Co. Cork in respect of the 2004/2005 school year. Analysis of this data indicates that 7.4% of primary pupils were absent for more than 20 days during that school year. The figure for post-primary pupils was 12.5% for the same period. These figures compare favourably with the national averages for pupils absent for more than 20 days which are 10% and 18.8% for primary and post primary respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_2965">The 2005/06 data is currently being prepared by the NEWB for publication and the 2006/2007 data has not yet been analysed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2966">This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education. It must be remembered also that the service provided by the NEWB is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to support schools, families and young people themselves. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and the provision of breakfast and homework clubs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2967">In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 620 staff within the education sector in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS (Delivering quality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Completion Programme (SCP) is a preventative measure designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving. School attendance is a central objective of SCP with targeted interventions for children at risk of early school leaving through a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. These supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) works to involve parents in their children's education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2968">Work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration. This approach aims to develop the delivery of services in a cohesive way and ensure that optimum use is made of all resources deployed including the resources of the NEWB.</p>

The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Board runs promotional campaigns on the importance of attendance and finishing school and provides a service locally through its Education Welfare Officers to parents, children and schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2971">An additional 15 staff were allocated to the NEWB in 2007. The recruitment for these extra posts is ongoing and I am informed that this will be finalised shortly. This increases the authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts in total of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area. The recruitment of these extra staff to the NEWB will continue to strengthen local delivery and contribute to improving the coverage in respect of services provided by the Board. The ongoing allocation of posts will continue to be evaluated in light of operational experience and identified need. The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWO's and 72 EWO's. The financial allocation to the Board in 2008 is €10.119 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2972">In relation to the deputy's specific query concerning the deployment of educational welfare service staff in the Cork South West constituency, I am informed by the Board that the deployment of officers does not correspond with constituency boundaries. However Co Cork is one of the regional areas of the Board and there are eight EWOs currently assigned to this region. One of these posts has been assigned specifically to cater for the Cork South West area, while two others have responsibility for certain schools in this area also. There is also a Senior EWO deployed by the Board in Cork who has specific responsibility for the eight officers assigned to Co.Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_2973">It should, however, be remembered that the service provided by the Board is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and the provision of breakfast and homework clubs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2974">In addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 620 staff within the education sector in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Completion Programme (SCP) is a preventative measure designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving. School attendance is a central objective of SCP with targeted interventions for children at risk of early school leaving through a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. These supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) works to involve parents in their children's education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2975">Work is ongoing within my Department to develop appropriate protocols for the agencies and services to work together in collaboration. This approach aims to develop the delivery of services in a cohesive way and ensure that optimum use is made of all resources deployed including the resources of the NEWB.</p>
            <p eId="para_2976">I will be keeping the issue of resources for the NEWB under review in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2978">I wish to advise the Deputy that the information requested in respect of special education teachers and special needs assistants for primary schools in the Clondalkin area is not readily available. However, I wish to advise the Deputy that the level of resources being made available by my Department to support students with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream education nationally, including the Clondalkin area has grown significantly in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2979">There are now over 8,800 teachers at primary and post-primary schools working directly with children with SEN, including those requiring learning support, compared with fewer than 1,700 in 1998. In addition, significant progress has been made in relation to increasing the number of special needs assistants (SNAs) in our schools who specifically cater for children with care needs. There are currently in excess of 9,800 SNAs in primary, post-primary and special schools supporting pupils with special care needs compared with approximately 300 in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_2980">I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs continues to be a key Government priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_3065">It is not clear from the Deputy's query whether or not her question relates to a situation where: 1. The title to a property is already registered in the Land Registry and the registered owner transfers the property or part of the property to a new owner or 2. The title to the property has not been registered in the Land Registry to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_3066">In the case of 1., the position is that pursuant to Section 51 of the Registration of Title Act 1964, no legal interest passes to the new owner until such time as the new ownership has been registered in the Land Registry.</p>
            <p eId="para_3067">In the case of 2., registration of title in the Land Registry is compulsory in certain circumstances.  Further details in this regard can be obtained from the Property Registration Authority, including from their website.</p>
            <p eId="para_3068">When an application for registration is completed in the Land Registry, the effect of that registration is entered on a folio.  There are some 1.8 million folios in the Land Registry which collectively make up "the Register".  The Register is a public record and any person may inspect the Register or apply for a certified copy on payment of the prescribed fee.</p>

            <p eId="para_3082">Athenry Garda Station is open to the public from 10am to 1pm on a daily basis.

Of course, community policing involves more than a single unit within An Garda Síochána. All Gardaí have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as they arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_3087">Important partnerships in which the Gardaí are involved are the Community Alert Programme and Neighbourhood Watch.

Such placements are already a well-established element of the social studies training module for student Gardaí.  The Government is very committed to tackling domestic violence. In June, 2007 the Government established Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, with a remit to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated "whole of Government" response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. As part of its remit Cosc facilitates the development of strategies and services in relation to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in line with best international practice. This involves mapping current service standards as well as sourcing, disseminating and, in due course, facilitating the implementation of best practice in relation to the services.  Cosc is working closely with all stakeholders in this area, including An Garda Síochána, to maximise prevention of these crimes, the protection of victims and the improvement of services to those affected.</p>

With regard to relevant international agreements, Ireland ratified the European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (Valletta Convention) in 1997.  Under the terms of the Convention the Parties undertake to implement measures for the physical protection of the archaeological heritage. Measures to be undertaken include making provision as circumstances demand for archaeological heritage conservation and maintenance, preferably in situ where feasible, but also making provision for appropriate storage places for archaeological remains which have been removed from their original location. The archaeological principle of a presumption in favour of preservation in situ is part of the Department's established policy on archaeology as set out in the 1999 publication "Framework and Principles for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage".</p>
            <p eId="para_3210">At all times in considering how best to protect the integrity of the Turoe Stone, the provisions of the National Monuments Acts and, in the broader context, the obligations of the Valletta Convention have been, and will continue to be, adhered to and respected.  My Department's aim in this matter is to ensure the long-term protection of the national monument for current and future generations in accordance with best archaeological practice and with national and international law.</p>

         if his attention has been drawn to the difficult situation in towns like Cavan and Monaghan regarding the fact that they do not have Bord Gáis natural gas available to them; his plans to extend such pipelines to Cavan in particular at the request of companies (details supplied) who have to compete with others who have such facilities available to them elsewhere; if he has had discussions with Bord Gáis towards extensions to such towns; if he will provide additional support to towns like these in disadvantaged areas especially in the border region; and the timescale for such an extension or such an investment.

            <p eId="para_3261">I have no statutory functions with regard to the connection of towns to the gas network.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is a statutory independent body, has, since 2002, been charged with all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State, under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_3262">Acting in this capacity, the CER in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which provided an opportunity to reconsider the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  This is to ensure that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  The new policy allows for the appraisal of a new town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns. In this context, Bord Gais Éireann (BGÉ) is carrying out a comprehensive study of towns not already connected to the national gas network.</p>
            <p eId="para_3263">I am advised that both the towns of Cavan and Monaghan, together with other towns in the vicinity (Castleblaney, Cootehill and Shercock), are being examined as part of phase 3 of this study, which is currently under way and is scheduled for completion near the end of this year.  BGÉ's final report will outline what towns or groups of towns are economically viable for connection, within the revised connection policy criteria.  BGÉ has a dedicated email address, newtowns@bge.ie, for the purpose of dealing with queries related to the connection of new towns and routinely engages with local stakeholders to allow towns under consideration to be examined in as comprehensive a manner as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_3267">The Programme for Government reaffirms the commitment in the Energy Policy White Paper to the transfer of ownership of the electricity transmission network assets from ESB to EirGrid by end 2008.  There has been no departure from that position.  The mechanisms to implement the transfer to EirGrid of ownership of the assets comprise a range of legislative, commercial, legal and financial dimensions, which are currently under consideration by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3268">The drafting and publication of the necessary legislation is a key step in the process.  The Bill will include provisions enabling EirGrid to fulfil the requirements of the Transmission Asset Ownership function and undertake any necessary borrowing.  The legislation is also likely to include a range of amendments to existing electricity legislation to fully reflect the new arrangement.  The advice of the Attorney General on the precise parameters of the legislation will determine the scoping of legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3269">In line with successive Partnership Agreements, there will be a full process of engagement with the management and unions of both ESB and EirGrid on implementation of the transfer of the asset ownership function.  The process will also include engagement on legitimate concerns of the ESB's Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT).</p>
            <p eId="para_3270">A number of meetings have already taken place with the various stakeholders in relation to the energy policy objectives set out in the Programme for Government and the Energy Policy White Paper which impact on ESB.  I have made it clear that I am willing to discuss constructively any legitimate issues of concern that they may have.  I look forward to a positive process of engagement and to further meetings as appropriate with the relevant parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3271">Government policy is clear in relation to implementation of the transmission assets decision in a way that ensures the strategic future of both EirGrid and ESB as strong viable Semi State entities, as well as reflecting the position of the State and the ESOT as shareholders.</p>

            <p eId="para_3273">The National Postcode Project Board (NPPB) presented its recommendation as to the most appropriate postcode system for Ireland, the costs and benefits arising from its introduction along with a detailed implementation plan.  A proposal concerning the introduction of postcodes went to Government in May 2007 and Government decided that, prior to the introduction of postcodes, further analysis to quantify the wider economic and societal benefits should be carried out.</p>
            <p eId="para_3274">In arriving at its recommendation, the NPPB's advisors carried out two extensive consultations with stakeholders both within the postal sector and outside it with a view to arriving at a postcode model that would best meet the needs of the stakeholders and to measure the likely costs and benefits of the introduction, promotion and maintenance of such a postcode.</p>
            <p eId="para_3275">In order to progress the project, my Department is currently carrying out this analysis and it is my intention to revert to Government on this matter as soon as the analysis is complete.</p>
