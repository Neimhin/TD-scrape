          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">Yesterday in Dublin, 52,000 homes were not provided with the refuse service for which they have paid. In the last three weeks in south Dublin, people have paid over €2 million in refuse charges, while €6 million has been paid in that area since the beginning of the year. Everyone has rights and responsibilities. It is perfectly fair to say that everyone has the right to legitimate protest, but not the right to prevent a service being provided for those who have paid a legitimate charge. Does the Taoiseach agree that people who pay for a refuse service, particularly in Dublin city, have a right to have that service provided? Has the Taoiseach asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to consult with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that a service for which people have paid and which they expect to be provided, will be provided? In recognising that people have a right to legitimate protest, does the Taoiseach agree that this entitlement does not extend to the prevention of a service for which a charge has been legitimately paid?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_2">I agree with Deputy Kenny. Direct dues or charges for household waste collection, which arose from legislation passed in this House and an EU directive of 1996, are widely applied not only in this country but throughout Europe. They give effect to the polluter pays principle which is the requirement of that EU directive and the legislation. The provision was set out in the Waste Management Act 1996 so it is the law of the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">The great majority of householders pay waste collection and disposal charges. Many others in various categories have waivers, and being entitled to waivers they also comply with the law. I have no doubt those people would readily agree that it is unjust for the majority of householders who comply with the law and pay their fees, or who are entitled not to do so, to effectively subsidise others who enjoy the service but refuse to pay for it and are in default. The power to allow local authorities to discontinue collection of waste from householders who have not paid the charges was introduced against that background over a period. The legislation is the law of the land and has passed through the democratic process. It must be respected equally by all citizens. These issues were debated over a long period.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">Deputy Kenny noted yesterday's disruption in Fingal, Dublin city and south Dublin. I have the details. Small numbers of protesters were involved. Nobody likes to see anyone injured as a result of these issues but people cannot take the law into their own hands. There have been discussions within Government on the matter and between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Garda, and the matter is being monitored closely this morning because there are further protests taking place at the four Dublin bases.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_5">I understand that up to 80% of people in the Dublin City Council area have paid the charges. This is not an industrial dispute. The situation has resulted in council workers being left to confront protesters, with disturbing consequences which were evident last night. If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has spoken to the Garda Commissioner or the Garda authorities about ensuring that the service is provided, can the Taoiseach confirm that the Minister will report to the House today on the monitoring of the situation, so that those who have paid for and expect a refuse collection service can have it provided, and so that we do not descend into the situation referred to yesterday by the Tánaiste, where anarchy might prevail? It is very important that the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, should assert that in a democracy we recognise the right to legitimate protest, but that it does not extend to the prevention of a service being provided for those who have paid for it. I would like the Taoiseach to reassure the House and those who have paid for the service that it will be provided today.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_6">I reaffirm what I said regarding the Waste Management Act 1996 and the subsequent legislative changes asserting the right of local authorities in more recent times not to collect waste when people will not pay. That is the law of the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I would not like to give the impression that there are vast numbers of people involved in anarchy or protest. Yesterday there were 20 protesters in Fingal. From the information I have received, there were in total about 60 people involved in protests at depots in Rathmines, Collins Avenue, Grangegorman and Davitt Road. I am not sure if there are other locations.</p>

          <p eId="para_13">There were about 40 protesters involved in Dún Laoghaire. In all, there were about 150 protesters involved. The Garda is <i>in situ</i> in all these locations this morning and intends to deal with the situation as responsibly as it can. Nobody wishes people to be injured or to impose hardship on protesters. Neither do we wish drivers to suffer stress as it is not easy to confront protesters. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is taking questions this afternoon and I am sure he will have an appropriate reply in this regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_14">Notwithstanding what the Taoiseach has already said, is he now saying this matter is to be left to the Garda and the courts? Is that the only solution we are offering in a situation where waste is being piled high on the streets causing a public health hazard, where political activists are being imprisoned and where conflict is being fomented between residents? One of the more important recent developments is that council workers are being taken off the payroll. Does the Taoiseach agree that an initiative is required that would involve the organisers calling off the blockade and the Minister terminating the order for non-collection which triggered these extreme protests? Does he agree that any regime of charges ought to have regard to ability to pay, they ought to be waste or volume related, that each local authority ought to have a reasonable and fair waiver system and that increases should be limited to indexation?</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Does the Taoiseach agree that householders and families cannot be left in circumstances where their bins are uncollected and that it will take some initiative other than merely leaving it to the Garda – this is a difficult area to police – and the courts to resolve this matter? Will he say if section 30 of the Act which has triggered this situation can be put into abeyance on condition that the blockade is called off and that there is no industrial dimension to this dispute whereby workers continue to be suspended and taken off the payroll?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_12">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_16">I have a great deal of sympathy for the workers involved as the situation is not of their making. Household waste is not being collected and disposed of in the normal efficient way because a small group of protesters, yesterday fewer than 150 people were involved, in a city of 1.25 million people are blocking the council from doing so. That is the reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">The easy thing to do when one is faced with difficulty is to find the easiest solution and to stand down the law. If Deputy Rabbitte is asking me if I agree with that, I do not. The law is the law. Deputy Rabbitte is suggesting we should stand down the law when it becomes inconvenient for people or when political activists do not like it and wish to flout it. I do not agree we should stand down the law. While the situation is a difficult one, consultation is ongoing. To avoid having to pursue the cumbersome approach arising in every case, legislation was introduced under the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 providing that local authorities are no longer obliged to collect waste from persons who fail to pay waste collection charges. Workers, officials and the Garda are trying to comply with that law. A high proportion of people are already paying their charges, some have been given waivers, and it is only fair that everyone is treated equally. One has to enforce the law to ensure everyone is treated equally. There is no easy solution to this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">On monitoring the position and trying to keep a cool head, of course I will do so. I do not wish the dispute to escalate into a hostile situation for all involved but that cannot mean putting aside the law.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_13">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_19">I did not say any of the things the Taoiseach ascribes to me. Even if he is correct in saying that only 150 people are involved in the protest, is he proposing we wait until all 150 of them are incarcerated in Mountjoy? I never said the law should not take its course. I never said people should not pay the price for being in contempt of court nor that reasonable protest is not permissible. This blockade is unreasonable and ought to be called off, but it was triggered by a particular measure which the Minister signed into law by order providing for non-collection of bins. That is the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">What does the Taoiseach have to say to families and householders in south County Dublin? Gardaí have advised council workers that for them to take the course recommended by the Taoiseach they would need to drive the lorries to the gate and if stopped from egressing the normal course will follow. However, the drivers have refused to drive the lorries to the gate and the advice from gardaí is that no action may be taken against the bin drivers concerned. How do we deal with that situation? Sooner or later some initiative will have to be taken to break this stand-off. We cannot have householders who are entitled to have their bins collected having to endure the pile up of waste outside their doors. That is not acceptable.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_14">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_21">I agree with Deputy Rabbitte on the latter point. I also agree that it is never good to allow a situation to develop into a difficult stand-off. I did not visit any of the depots yesterday so the figures are not mine. I am merely quoting from figures supplied by the Garda which state that there are approximately 150 people involved in the protest. I do not wish to get into a dispute in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Much of this started in Fingal where reasonable provisions were made and reasonable circumstances existed under the law. A group of people from the Fingal area have decided to use this issue as a means of flouting the law. I have no difficulty with people protesting as they did on the streets at the weekend. They have a right to do so. However, I do not think they have the right to protest in this particular manner. The difficulty is they are flouting the law and trying to prevent others from obtaining a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">As regards removing the existing provision, if I do not pay my electricity or gas bill, my service is cut off. If I do not pay my television licence fee, I am fined. If I do not pay my water charges other difficulties arise. If a person does not pay refuse charges then his or her bins should not be collected.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">In a speech in Killarney the Taoiseach chose not to mention environmental sustainability, except in the context of how he might like to wreck it. Does the Taoiseach respect An Bord Pleanála? I have respect for the board, even when I do not agree with all of its decisions. I respect its role, expertise and objectivity. What role does the Taoiseach envisage for the board in the context of the proposed infrastructure board, especially in view of his commiseration with the man from Shell following the refusal of permission to build a terminal at Ballinaboy and Pollathomas? In that instance the board had to consider the effect of a dig-out of 600,000 tonnes of peat to be dumped in an unstable area with the threat of landslides and pollution to rivers. The recent landslide at Pollathomas illustrates the difficulties faced by the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">Will the Taoiseach outline what he proposes to do with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, who, as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, issued a foreshore licence in advance of the inconvenience of waiting for a decision on the granting of planning permission? It amounted to a nod and a wink, a cute go ahead from Fianna Fáil that the applicants could proceed and not worry about permission from An Bord Pleanála. What role does the Taoiseach envisage for the board in relation to issues of this kind?</p>
          <p eId="para_34">The Taoiseach has the gall to blame the presence of swans for creating the opposition to the bridge at the Malahide estuary. Does he not agree that his neck is much tougher than that of any swan, given that Ray Burke and his Fianna Fáil cronies rezoned the original road line for that development? The problem was not the swans but the rats in his party who have difficulty telling right from wrong and complying with the law.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">I am waiting for an answer to my question regarding the role of An Bord Pleanála. Will the Taoiseach answer it? Will he indicate if there is anything that An Bord Pleanála has done that is so wrong that he considers it necessary to sideline it, which is effectively what will happen if the proposed infrastructure board is established? The Taoiseach wants to challenge decisions made by the board on projects such as the one at Ballincollig and the Shell project. Does he agree with newspaper reports that the proposed infrastructure board is more concerned with fast-tracking the building of incinerators and other such projects, which he knows local communities will not accept?</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Does the Taoiseach also agree with the Forfás report which showed that between 1995 and 1998, waste generation in Ireland increased by 89% and Irish citizens produced far more waste than the European average, at 596 kilograms of municipal waste per person compared to the European average of 450 kilograms per person? The report also showed that almost 2.3 million tonnes of household and commercial waste was generated in Ireland, an increase of 62% in five years. The binmen are not responsible for the waste crisis, but does the Taoiseach accept that his Government is responsible for its failure to use the Waste Management Act, which gives plentiful powers to the Minister to reduce waste? When is the Taoiseach going to do his job and ensure there is a reduction in the creation of waste?</p>

My difficulty with An Bord Pleanála is the inordinate amount of time it takes to make decisions on major projects because of its huge workload. This proposal will assist it in that regard. There is not a Deputy in the House who is not constantly pointing out the need for more resources and structures to enable the board to run more efficiently. Some major projects take up an enormous amount of the board's time, which is understandable. The hardworking staff in the board need assistance.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_68">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">I am pleased to inform the House that the Nally report has been largely implemented and that the detail is available in both the annual reports of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Attorney General, which were published in December 2002. Arrangements are in train to bring forward the necessary legislation to transfer the responsibility for the State Solicitor Service from the Office of the Attorney General to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is intended to include this amending legislation in suitable legislation which is already in draft.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">The Office of the Attorney General is operating well and there are no specific plans at present to make any organisational changes. However, this is not to say that organisational changes will not be made as necessary in the future in order to ensure efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">As the Deputies will be aware, there are commitments under Sustaining Progress to implement modernisation across the Civil Service and, where appropriate, these are being implemented in the Office of the Attorney General. The Public Service Recruitment Bill and the Civil Service Regulation Bill, when enacted, will bring about many changes for all elements of the Civil Service. The Office of the Attorney General is committed to modernisation. Any planned changes are set out in the strategy statement which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in June of this year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_54">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_72">Recently the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. James Hamilton, gave his first ever media interview, in which he spoke candidly about the workings of his office and difficulties outside his control. He voiced concern about the inconsistency in sentencing for similar crimes, in particular, and the backlog that results in delays of several years prior to cases coming before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">Given that members of the Government have been forthright in saying justice delayed is justice denied in other areas, what actions does the Government proposes to take to clear the backlog of cases? This is outside the control of the DPP and requires direct action by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">The transfer of responsibility for the local State Solicitor service from the Attorney General's office to the DPP was one of the key recommendations of the Nally report. What progress has been achieved in the discussions that have taken place? When will legislation be introduced to give effect to the recommendation?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_55">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_75">On the second question, legislation is required and I understand discussions and work on that are taking place. I do not have a date for the legislation but progress has been made. It is the final element in the full implementation of the Nally report.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">On the first question, the Director of Public Prosecutions made a number of comments about issues requiring legislation in the justice area. A number has been addressed in current Bills and he highlighted the implementation of three criminal justice Bills which are to be introduced. I do not recall exactly when they are to be brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">With regard to staffing the office of the DPP, there were difficulties for a long time filling posts but there are not many vacancies now. The issue of outsourcing the office's work was raised continually in the House and we moved on that. An enormous amount of work is outsourced to private solicitors. Deputy Quinn advocated this for many years and I agreed with him.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_56">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_78">The Taoiseach agreed but it took long enough to implement it.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_57">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_79">I accept it took a few years. However, all the advocacy work in the jury courts is handled by private practitioners acting on the DPP's instructions, which is a significant change. All the State Solicitor's work is also in the hands of local solicitors. The largest item of expenditure in the office's budget is counsel fees, which are represented by that work. The State Solicitor's office also makes extensive use of counsel in dealing with the day to day caseload and that has made a significant difference to the work of the DPP. A public prosecutions solicitor has been in place for some time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_58">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_80">Does the Taoiseach agree that when the DPP makes such observations they carry more weight than if they were made elsewhere in society and it is a serious matter when he expresses concern about uniformity of sentencing policy and the duration of backlog in areas of criminal law? Does the remedy for a number of matters raised by him lie not in more legislation but in the operation of the courts themselves? Is the Taoiseach satisfied sufficient progress has been made under the aegis of the new Courts Service in the areas referred to by the DPP?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_59">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_81">That is an issue but these are questions for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I do not monitor on a daily basis the implementation of the Court and Court Officers Act 2002 or the excellent Denham report. The DPP pointed out issues relating to staffing, outsourcing, technology and so on but they have all been addressed. He referred to legislation and it is our responsibility to put it in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">I am not up to date on how many of the reforms documented in the Denham report have been implemented. It was to be implemented in conjunction with the Nally report over two years between 1999 and 2001 as part of the reform package. I agree with the Deputy that reform of the offices of the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief State Solicitor, the courts and legislation were issues highlighted at the time.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_60">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_83">Questions Nos. 2 and 3 relate to changes in the Office of the Attorney General. Has consideration been given to the circumstances highlighted in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General where the then Attorney General felt obliged to refuse to give advice because he could not secure the documents necessary to enable him to give the advice? How does the Taoiseach propose to deal with a situation where the Attorney General or his staff are expected to give advice when their clients go AWOL? The then Minister for Education and Science and the Department refused to reply to correspondence over a period of ten weeks on a major matter that exposed the taxpayer. Do the changes implemented in the Attorney General's office provide against the situation recurring?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_61">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_84">The Attorney General gives advice to the Government and Departments but that does not prevent Ministers from making their own decisions on policy issues, which they subsequently report on and clear through Cabinet. From time to time the Attorney General's office and Departments are involved in meetings on day to day issues but the office is not involved in everything because it does not have to be. Such a reform is not necessary in the day to day running of the office. Naturally, the office likes to be kept up to date on issues. It would have been better in regard to certain issues if letters had been responded to more quickly, but it is not necessary for staff of the Attorney General's office to be present at every meeting.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_62">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_85">The Taoiseach will acknowledge that when a Minister is dealing with a policy matter that has legal and/or constitutional implications, under our Constitution the Attorney General is obliged to give advice. What transpired in this situation was that the Attorney General was disabled from doing so because he could not even secure the documents.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_63">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_86">In this instance, because there was a stand off in the negotiations, the Minister took action to deal with policy issues and, when he had done so, he continued the negotiations with the Attorney General's office. Legal advice was necessary and was given over a six month period. However, when a Minister is involved in policy issues, he or she does not have to seek legal advice every day when trying to undo an issue. The Attorney General does not attend every Government meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">I readily accept that the Government should take legal advice and keep the Office of the Attorney General informed. It is best practice for the Government to respond to correspondence from the Office of the Attorney General. That is what is meant to happen. In this case we know there was a delay.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">It is important that this detail is placed on the record. In light of that experience, I would like to know the extent to which the Attorney General should be physically present when issues of importance, with major expenditure implications, are involved. This is crucial to the central question about the reorganisation of the Office of the Attorney General. I am asking about the how, the when and the what.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_100">It is a matter of office organisation. The Attorney General is present for most meetings of the Cabinet or Cabinet sub-committees. He attends most meetings of Cabinet sub-committees with his staff. The Attorney General is not present when most of the details are being discussed with Departments. In such circumstances, the meeting would be attended by the Secretary General or whoever the relevant person is under the divisions of EU law or criminal law.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">I can correct what I may have said by confirming that personnel from the Office of the Attorney General were present at the 12 meetings. That is how the system operates. I am not quibbling about this, but it is not the case that the Attorney General has to be present when Ministers are dealing with or having a discussion on any issue. Of course they should answer the letters and their Departments should not ignore the Attorney General's letters. There should be communication. In any event, each Minister meets the Attorney General at least once a week. The Attorney General probably meets those Ministers who are involved in Cabinet sub-committees two or three times each week. There should not be delays or difficulties in either response or correspondence.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">Does the Taoiseach agree that the role of Attorney General should be more transparent? Is he conscious that, more often than not, his references and those of his Ministers to the advice of the Attorney General relate to political decisions rather than legal decisions? Does the Taoiseach not agree that there should be greater openness and a greater opportunity for public access to the advice of the Attorney General so that we can know, or we can have some sense of, where his advice is coming from?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_103">I do not really agree. I have had a fair amount of experience in this regard over the years, thankfully. The Attorney General gives legal advice to the Government, which has to make decisions on policy issues. Of course the Government will take account of the Attorney General's advice. It has been the practice since the foundation of the State, however, that the advice given by successive Attorneys General has not been placed in the public domain. It often happens – I have seen it happen – that different Attorneys General take a different view on the same issue. There have been many such instances. Attorneys General appointed by the same Government have taken different views on the same issue. It often happens – I encountered such a case recently – that an Attorney General asks for counsel opinion in respect of a major case. I have encountered four different views on one issue. One can imagine the fun and games if one placed all the legal advice in the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">The Government has to make a decision at the end of the day. It would normally ask the Attorney General to state his final legal view on the matter. That has happened on many occasions. I see such cases in files day in, day out.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">I do not think so. The Attorney General does not have an easy task nowadays because there is so much litigation in respect of practically everything. It was not the same in the early years of the State, or even 20 years ago. I think the procedure is correct. The Attorney General of the day gives advice to the Government and the Government, of course, has to take account of it. I cannot imagine a position in which the Government would go against the final advice of the Attorney General. The legal advice that is given evolves, as people who are brought in to consider cases may give contrary views. It is a regular occurrence, particularly in respect of constitutional issues. The Deputy is aware that it is almost inevitable that there will be different views in respect of constitutional cases.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_133">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_171">I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">As I informed the House in my reply of 20 May 2003, the high level group on regulation has made considerable progress since its establishment in May 2001, following publication of the OECD review on regulatory reform in Ireland. The group has met 16 times to date and reported to Government on its progress in November 2002. The report is available on my Department's Better Regulation website.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">The group has focused on two areas in particular. First, it began the process of framing a White Paper on better regulation through the publication of the public consultation document, Towards Better Regulation. The consultation document was designed to highlight the key issues that are likely to feature in the national policy statement and to promote public debate and awareness on better regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">The consultation document sets out the key questions that we need to address in considering why we regulate, what we need to regulate and new approaches to governance in a global economy. It is important to emphasise that this process is not about resolving micro-level regulatory issues or specific market problems. Rather, it is about giving us a set of core principles to guide future regulation and policy making.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The consultation process was widely publicised in the media, through Government websites, seminars and presentations. Approximately 4,000 copies of the consultation document were distributed and 90 submissions were received from a wide variety of interested parties. A full list of submissions is available on my Department's Better Regulation website.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">To inform the subsequent formulation of the White Paper, these submissions have been studied and analysed. Earlier this year, my Department published a booklet containing two papers, the first summarising the submissions received and the second offering an independent analysis and commentary on the submissions by an economist. Over 1,000 copies of the booklet have been sent to interested parties and copies have, of course, been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">A drafting group composed of senior officials from key Departments is in place to prepare the White Paper on regulation, and has met on seven occasions to date. While a specific date for publication has not been set, it is anticipated that the draft text of the policy statement will be submitted to the Government in the coming weeks with a view to publication before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">The second priority of the high level group has been the development of a system of regulatory impact analysis as recommended by the OECD in its report. RIA is a policy tool designed to identify and quantify, where possible, the impact of new and existing regulations. A working group of officials has been developing a model that would be suitable for the Irish policy making context. The group has recommended a particular approach and I understand the next steps will be to pilot the model in a small number of volunteer Departments, prepare detailed guidance material and supports and devise and deliver a programme of awareness raising and training to inform civil servants and other interested parties about RIA.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The publication of a White Paper on regulation in 2003 and the introduction of RIA across Departments are two of the commitments on regulatory reform contained in Sustaining Progress. Overall, significant progress has been made in the area of better regulation since the establishment of the high level group on regulation and I look forward to continued progress in the period ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">To progress another strand of the public service modernisation agenda, a working group was established in 1999 to oversee the development of the quality customer service initiative. The working group is currently chaired by Mr. Frank Daly, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, and includes members from Government Departments and offices as well as representatives of trade unions, business, consumer and equality interests. The group also has a number of sub-groups addressing specific aspects of customer service.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">The group continues to develop policies to ensure improvements in the level of service provided by the Civil Service. Examples of the work undertaken by the group in recent years include: the publication of 12 principles of quality customer service for customers of the public service; the establishment of the QCS officers network, to support the work of those directly involved in promoting and delivering the QCS agenda in individual Departments; the publication, in consultation with the Equality Authority, of a support pack on the equality-diversity aspects of quality customer service; commissioning an independent evaluation of customer action plans produced by Departments and offices; commissioning a survey by Lansdowne Market Research to assess the level of satisfaction with the service provided by the Civil Service; and the publication of a new manual to support Departments and offices in the introduction of the customer charter initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The evaluation of action plans, as well as the evaluation of the overall strategic management initiative by PA Consulting, concluded that considerable improvements have been achieved in the level of customer service provided. Likewise, the survey by Lansdowne Market Research found generally a very high level of satisfaction with the Civil Service. Some 79% of the public were very or fairly satisfied with the level of service. The evaluations also made a range of recommendations for further improvement and the group has adopted a work programme based on these recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Last December, I spoke at the conference on quality customer service. In my speech, I asked every Department and office to publish a charter of service standards. The charter should set down clear standards of service to which Departments or offices are committed. These standards should be established following consultation with customers and staff, and achievement of the standards should be evaluated and reported in each Department's annual report.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The detailed guidelines have been prepared by the working group to support and assist Departments in implementing this initiative. They were approved by Government in June 2003 and circulated to all Departments and offices. The working group, in co-operation with the centre for management and organisation development in the Department of Finance, has also organised a training programme for officers and other staff involved in the preparation of customer charters. With these supports in place, each Department and office will be in a position to introduce a customer charter early next year and report on the achievement of the standards in these charters in their 2004 annual reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">While the improvements in the level of customer service will ultimately depend on the commitment of management and staff at the level of each Department and office, the quality customer service working group has helped to deliver significant improvements over the past few years. The group's support for the customer charter initiative builds on the achievements of the initiatives of the quality customer service working group to date and will reinforce the efforts Departments and offices are already making in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">I will not ask the Taoiseach to repeat the reply to the question. That is one of the longest replies we have had in the House for a very long time.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_188">Arising from some of the contents of the reply, I refer the Taoiseach to a statement made recently by the chairperson of the Commission for Communications Regulation, Ms Doyle. She said that Irish mobile phone charges are among the highest in the world and have fallen more slowly than those in most other states. She pointed out that the two biggest mobile companies in Ireland hold 96% of the mobile market and that they had a pre-tax profit of almost €300 million last year. In ending the monopoly, the Government has actually created a duopoly.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">Does the Taoiseach accept that the way this matter was handled is directly responsible for the circumstances that now obtain, which are bad for business and the consumer? Is the Taoiseach concerned about the possible loss of competitiveness and the resulting damage to the economy because of charges that are higher than the EU average? Does he believe that new entrants to the market should be given access to the networks of the larger and more dominant players in the market?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_137">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_190">The issues raised by Deputy Kenny are not necessarily related. Although he drew our attention to a major issue, there is a lot of competition in the business, particularly in the mobile sector. There is more in the mobile sector than in any other sector, although we still have high charges relative to those in other areas. The Minister has been involved in long and detailed discussions with all the companies involved to try make progress in this area. However, it is not a case of there being a lack of competition or that mobile companies do not have access to the framework – they have – or a case of issues pertaining to their pricing policies. The Minister has made some progress but he is trying to get the companies to make contributions to broadband, which would be useful because these are the same companies that could drive broadband in terms of the issues we discussed yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The Minister will be following on from his discussions and ultimately making a report, if he has not already done so. He has now completed the discussions and is trying to secure financial contributions from the companies involved towards his broadband initiative.</p>

I was informed that if I did so I would not be able to access the system in Leinster House. It seems to be very contradictory that if one follows the Minister's advice to have broadband—</p>

          <p eId="para_195">In welcoming the OECD report on regulatory reform, the Taoiseach announced the acceleration of a review of the health regulations governing the award of the general medical scheme contracts to pharmacies. The pharmacy review group was chaired by Dr. Michael Mortell and it reported its findings recently. Has the Taoiseach examined the findings of the group and, if so, do they have his support? Will he comment on whether the findings will be implemented in full?</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_199">The Taoiseach welcomed the OECD report on regulatory reform. This is an aspect of regulatory reform on which the review group has reported findings. I ask the Taoiseach if he accepts those findings.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_145">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_200">All the reports issued on this matter have been dealt with by the line Departments. The one referred to, which was published earlier this year, is being examined by the Minister for Health and Children. He intends to publish his findings on it shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">On the first question pertaining to the general issue of regulatory reform, regulation is not always necessary – the OECD has stressed this – and where it exists, it should be of good quality and not characterised by unnecessary bureaucracy, built-in charges or overheads that affect competitiveness. It should be in a simplified form and should be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">The group to which I referred in my lengthy reply cannot deal with all the legislation and regulations of the past but, in terms of those of the future, it can examine what is considered to be good practice and design regulations of a simplified form that do not make the country uncompetitive. The group has completed a model and the senior officials of all the Departments worked hard on it. They believe, as does the OECD, that we have had too much law and regulation and that there are other models in other countries which, if adopted, would work better. The model that has been completed is designed around these models and it will prove to be quite effective. It took years to build. The group has been trying to change something that has existed for decades, but it has designed a very good programme. The subject of the White Paper may not be the most exciting in the world but it is very important in terms of the future competitiveness of the country.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_204">The Competition Authority is dealing with four major areas and its reports have to be implemented by the Departments. Eight professions have been examined: engineers, architects, dentists, veterinarians, solicitors, barristers, optometrists and medical practitioners. The consultants' report was published earlier this year and, based on this, the authority is now engaging in further consultation. It hopes to deal with the issues concerning each of the professions. A consultation report containing draft recommendations for changes relating to architects is due in October – I do not know whether it has been published yet – while reports on dentists and veterinarians will be issued before Christmas. Reports on barristers, solicitors, optometrists and medical practitioners in that order will be issued next year so all the reports will be issued within the next 12 months.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_205">How will matters proceed once the reports have been published? Will the professional bodies be charged with implementing their findings or will the recommendations for change be implemented at all?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_206">The Competition Authority has engaged directly with the professions and will issue recommendations. Some of these may be statutory – I am not sure – but whoever is responsible will then have to implement the recommendations. I understand agreement has not been reached, as one would expect, on all these issues following discussions with the professions. The Government's line will be to take the report to the Competition Authority and use its conclusions as the basis for implementation.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">Yes, we have taken on board the criticisms in the professional reports and other reports, of which there are several, including one on the licensed trade. We are implementing the report on the pharmacies. There are others on professional services, the electricity sector, communications and many more. We have developed the best model from looking at what is happening in Europe, examining research by the European Commission and the OECD and implementing it. We have tried to deal with the criticism in a direct manner. We accepted it at the time and have tried to implement a best practice model. This is what some of the working groups to which I referred are actively doing.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">While I am not objecting to the taking of this business, it is an example of bad practice. The Government should have anticipated the need for a proper debate on this Bill, yet it is proposed to guillotine it as it needs to be implemented by 1 November. Members will have to take Committee Stage debate tomorrow with Second Stage barely completed. This is not fair to the House, which will not be able to give proper, reflected consideration to the Bill. While we support the objectives of the legislation, this is bad practice and the Taoiseach should take steps to prevent it happening in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">This Bill was taken in a rushed manner due to a deadline. The relevant committee, the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, was sitting at the same time as Second Stage was being taken in the House. I mentioned this case of bad practice to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. We received notice of the importance of the Bill well in advance. It could have been allocated more time and disposed of much earlier in the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">I concur with the previous speakers. While relatively minor, the Bill allows us to indicate issues on which Government policy in this area is falling down, of which there are many. The Dáil cannot have an impact when speakers do not have the time to contribute on this important issue. Many areas of Government policy need to be tackled with regard to oil pollution of the sea and its prevention in future and this Bill is only part of that. We need more time to debate the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_223">I concur with the other speakers. I think I am correct in saying this is the first time the guillotine has been employed in this session and that is unfortunate. Members have indicated their general support for the proposals in the Bill. The Government should take account of the collective view of the Opposition and extend the time. That would meet the need for a full debate in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">I accept the point that it would have been better to have more time to debate the Bill. The original intention was to include this Bill and the compensation mechanisms it provides for in a wider Bill but the Minister had to take this course. However, there will be other opportunities to discuss the issues. They will be dealt with in a more detailed Bill which is due to be brought forward. When introducing this Bill, the Minister said that the Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is more wideranging and will relate to and fulfil requirements regarding other aspects of the marine environment. However, the provisions relating to the increased limits were fast tracked and published separately to comply with the deadline of 1 November. The other issues will be taken again under different legislation. I accept the points being made and thank Members for their co-operation on this issue. We have to deal with this matter now in order to meet the deadline.</p>

          <p eId="para_226">No. The proposal relates to how the statements will be taken. It cannot be called a debate because it will not amount to that. We will have two hours and 15 minutes to address one of the most important issues affecting not only this jurisdiction but the European Union. There will be no opportunity for a question and answer exchange with the relevant Minister and the Taoiseach and there is no motion before the House so there will not be a vote. This is a dead and inappropriate way of addressing something that will have far-reaching implications for every citizen of this country and the European Union. We are failing in our responsibility and the Government is failing in its commitment, given during the Nice treaty debate, to transparency and full assessment of all EU matters in future Oireachtas procedures. That is not happening in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Over the past fortnight the Government has been negotiating on behalf of the Irish people but the people know little about the Government's stated position or approach in its engagement with other EU representatives on such controversial issues as, for example, the common defence proposal. This Chamber is where we should discuss this issue. I regret that proper accommodation of that debate is not entailed in this proposal.</p>

The new working arrangements mean that as the debate moves on, we will continue to report to the committee. I do not have a difficulty with debating it in the House either. It is not an issue that will end. The Intergovernmental Conference has started and the committee will continue to reflect on the debate as it happens. We will come before the committee at each stage.</p>

It also shows that over 500 people with intellectual disabilities are wrongly placed in psychiatric institutions. What progress is being made in introducing judicable rights for people with a disability so they can go to court to have their needs addressed? The Government has promised to introduce a disabilities Bill but to date we have not seen what rights will be conferred and whether it will be possible to pursue them in court.

Hopefully, the Bill will be ready in November but it is an enormous task.

I appreciate that there are many demands for debates, but we must pin this issue down. I ask the Taoiseach to respond.</p>

          <p eId="para_282">Regarding a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has established a working group on Garda vetting of people with significant unsupervised access to children and vulnerable persons. The group's work is aimed at the enhancement of services provided by the Garda central vetting unit. Therefore the issues being discussed have a considerably wider impact than the education sector alone. The group has representatives from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Office of the Attorney General. It is currently not possible to give a date.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">As the Deputy is aware, the recommendations also give effect to the recommendations of the child protection joint working group, and that legislation arises from the North-South Ministerial Council. There have been delays in its work, but the working group is continuing to deal with that very important matter.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_304">There are one or two points I wish to reiterate. Oil importers must pay for pollution or destruction for which they are responsible. They must also be held to account for any wrongdoing in which they are involved. Is Ireland's lengthy coastline being safeguarded in the way that it should be and are the proper controls in place? Is the Government aware of the identity of the oil tankers or carriers that are sailing around our coast and does it have information about the cargoes they are carrying? It is important that we should know who is sailing our coastal waters and whether they are adhering to the safety regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Proper procedures must be observed, particularly on the single carrier tugs to which Deputies Coveney and Broughan referred. Proper safety standards are not being observed on single hukk tankers. These vessels pose a danger to our coastline, particularly in light of any oil spillage that might occur. Oil importers have a major responsibility to ensure that proper safety standards are in place and that the authorities here are made aware of the nature of each vessel's cargo.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Deputy Coveney referred to having a proper research vessel in place in the event of an oil spillage. In that context, I do not believe that the <i>Celtic Explorer</i> reaches the standards required. As stated last evening, time is of the essence if an oil spillage occurs. The Minister's officials may not agree with me but if there is an oil spillage off our coast, marine life will be placed in great danger. Everyone is aware of the importance of the sea and our coastline, strands and beaches. I would not like to see any of these destroyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">As stated last night, it is essential that a proper tow tug is put in place. If a ship got into trouble off our coast and became stranded, it might be possible for it to be towed away by tug without oil being spilled. I am aware that such a vessel would cost a great deal but it is extremely important that a proper tow tug is purchased.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I fully support this important Bill. It is great that people directly affected by oil pollution will be given proper compensation. As we have seen in countries such as Spain and France and even off the Donegal coast, it costs a great deal to clean up after a large oil spill. I welcome the fact that proper compensation will be provided. It is a pity the legislation is being rushed through.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill 2003 provides for the limits of compensation payable to victims of pollution resulting from spills of persistent oil from tankers to be increased by almost 50%. This is a short but urgent Bill which is required to be enacted by 1 November, the date on which the increased limits come into effect internationally. It is in the interests of contributors and potential victims that this deadline is met. In the event of an incident off our coast, the increased limits would only apply if our legislation were in line with that which applies internationally. The Bill is important and everyone will agree with its provisions. The international deadline is set for 1 November so everybody should welcome the legislation and ensure that we are not left behind the international community.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">West County Cork sustained the worst effects of two major incidents in recent memory, namely, the Whiddy Island explosion at Bantry in 1979 when 51 people died and the sinking of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> cargo ship off the Stags Rocks near Baltimore in 1986. Though the volume of oil from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> was relatively small, considerable damage was done and rows over State inaction led to the creation of the Department of the Marine. In the immediate aftermath of this disaster, Cork County Council did a very good clean-up job according to Dr. Tony Lewis, director of the hydraulics and maritime research centre at University College Cork. Between the sinking of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the disaster at Whiddy Island, a body of experience exists in this country in terms of dealing with such incidents. Recent groundings off the east coast, such as that of the barge <i>Skerchi </i>off the coast of County Wicklow in April 2000, have provided useful experience. In that instance, some 7,500 gallons of diesel were safely removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">There are stockpiles of pollution response equipment at bases in Dublin, Killybegs County Donegal and Castletownbere, County Cork. The Irish Lights tender <i>Granuaile</i> was designed with anti-pollution capabilities in mind. Its 50 tonne towing capacity can hold a stricken vessel offshore pending arrival of tugs. Naval Service vehicles are also equipped with limited capabilities and demonstrated them when the LE <i>Eithne</i> and Air Corps helped to salvage the <i>Yarrawonga,</i> the 85,000 tonne bulk carrier abandoned 170 miles off the west coast with 800 tonnes of fuel oil on board in January 1989.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">Compensation for oil pollution of the sea is payable in accordance with the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992 liability convention, and the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992 Fund Convention. The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Acts 1988 to 1998 give effect to these conventions. Agreement was reached at the IMO in October 2000 to increase the limit of the international fund for compensation for oil pollution damage by about 50%. These increases are to take effect on 1 November 2003. The limits specified in the 1988 to 1998 Acts need to be revised accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The purpose of this Bill is to increase the limits of compensation payable to victims of pollution resulting from spills of oil from tankers. Section 1 provides for the interpretation of terms in the Bill. Section 2 provides for the application of sections of this Bill in respect of incidents at sea. Section 3 provides for amendments to the limits of liability for pollution damage as determined in the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act 1988. Section 4 provides for amendments to the extent of liability of the fund as determined in the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act 1988. Section 5 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and construction and commencement of this Bill. It is anticipated that no additional Exchequer costs will be incurred in implementing this Bill when it is enacted. It is also anticipated that there will be no staff implications for Departments of State, State bodies or local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">We have a duty and obligation to protect our coastline and environment. We need to protect seals, birds and nature in general. We have seen the horrendous damage done by oil spillages in different parts of the world. Irresponsible actions and oil spillages cannot be tolerated. We must protect our natural assets. The implications are too damning and dangerous for our coastline, country and people. We must protect what we have. Oil is an expensive commodity. Some changes will have to be made so that people and our environment come first. People cannot have it all one way.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern on its introduction. He knows the beauty and value of our coastline, coming as he does from a beautiful and scenic spot in County Louth. He is doing all in his power to ensure that in his term in office, we will fully protect and look after our natural resources.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanArdagh" eId="spk_245">
          <from>Mr. Ardagh</from>
          <p eId="para_318">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill 2003. The Bill is an effort to further protect and maintain the beautiful coastline of our country. Like most Irish people, I am immensely proud of our natural heritage, including our coastline and the waters of the sea around us. This brings responsibilities not only for Ireland, but also on a European scale because Ireland has a disproportionately high percentage of Europe's coastline.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The Bill will help to provide further compensation to those who may suffer from the effects of a disaster in the unfortunate event that one should occur along our coast. These mainly include fishermen and those involved in the tourism industry. There have been many oil spills in the past and the amount of oil released into the world's waters is overwhelming. Millions of tonnes have sunk to our ocean floor, harming plants, animals and also resulting in human illness. There has also been a lack of funding for clean-up efforts. This Bill will help to ensure we put in place the laws, procedures and regulations necessary to minimise the dangers to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Due to the constant disruption to the ecosystem, wildlife continues to suffer and this can cause problems for fishermen. The livelihood of this group depends on a healthy ocean environment. In 1996 the <i>Sea Empress</i> spilled 72,000 tonnes of oil off the coast of Milford Haven in Britain. A blanket ban on fishing was imposed on the region as a result of this extreme oil spill. The source of revenue for many fishermen was put in jeopardy due to the carelessness of the vessel operator. One thousand fishermen lost their jobs over a period of a few weeks to a few months. This devastation affected many people and businesses throughout the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">There are a few elements that could help in the prevention of oil spills in the future. We should look at creating a set of fines and regulations for any tanker vessel travelling along our coastline. Having a limit on how close vessels are allowed to come to the shore would be a precautionary move to avoid any major damage to our shores. Another precaution would be the creation of certain limitations depending on weather conditions. There is a higher probability of accidents leading to oil spills in poor weather. A policy of forbidding tankers from coming too close to the coastline during bad weather would help to minimise the chance of a spill. There should be a limit on how close tankers can come to the shore during normal weather and that boundary should be pushed back further during bad weather to create an extra cushion. Any ship that disregards these regulations should be heavily fined. Money from this should go towards a fund for a rapid clean-up reaction. The money could be used for workers, necessary equipment and anything else that was needed to clean-up the spill as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Putting a charge on all oil carrying vessels within our international waters would be another way to create revenue for this fund. However, it is important that we keep these costs down to prevent an increase in oil prices for Ireland. Oil is already an expensive commodity and, as we do not have oil reserves of our own, we have to import all our oil. It is crucial to avoid any action that would force these prices up. Finding a common balance is difficult but imperative.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">It should be mandatory for all oil companies travelling through our waters to have a rapid reaction clean-up plan. By this I mean that every company that has a tanker using our waters should either have the resources, internally or externally, to take care of any problems arising from spills. By having a previously organised plan, the time lapse between an oil spill and the commencement of clean-up would be minimised. Between our efforts nationally and the efforts of the companies, the amount of damage could then be contained through swift action.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The compensation amount provided for in the Bill is important. We want to ensure people affected by disaster are fairly compensated. This is our number one priority. However, we must make sure we do not over-compensate people. If that were to happen there would be repercussions for which we are not ready. If oil companies are worried about the costs, their insurance premiums will go up and, therefore, oil prices will also go up. Finding that delicate balance in compensating those affected by an event and keeping oil companies at low cost levels should be our goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">In February 2002 there was an incident near Nova Scotia on the Canadian coast when a helicopter patrolling the area spotted a tanker, the <i>Baltic Confidence,</i> which had come from the Philippines. The ship had an oil slick behind it which was 50 km wide. This illegal dumping was extraordinarily bad because it took place very near a wildlife reserve, harming a large amount of wildlife, which could have been prevented. Because of the extreme nature of the incident the company was fined $125 million, the highest such fine recorded. Of that fine, $45,000 was paid to a wildlife rescue organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">We are bringing the amounts covered by the Bill to the standard level of present day costs of such disasters by increasing the compensation which can be paid. However, as shown by the <i>Baltic Confidence </i>case, many areas suffer in such disasters and we need to make up for the damage that is caused.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The beauty and diversity of Ireland's coastline is found nowhere else in the world and its unique quality lures many tourists here each year. Our coastline should be preserved in every way possible and part of that preservation involves keeping risks to a minimum. Tourists on our coasts do not want to see large oil tankers or, worse yet, oil spills. The beauty of our island needs to be maintained and it is our responsibility to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">In 2002 the <i>Prestige</i> spilt 77,000 tonnes of oil off the northern coast of Spain with catastrophic effects not only for the coast of Spain but also for the French coast. Tourist bookings in the Aquitaine region of France fell by 50% in comparison with the previous year. Tourism is an important industry in Ireland and many citizens depend on it for their livelihood. If we had a tragedy such as the <i>Prestige</i> spill on our coast the repercussions would be widespread. Oil spills damage animals, ecological systems and industries, while it takes years to clean up spills completely. When fuel oil comes on to the shore, it picks up sand and sinks very quickly. Every time there is a storm subsequently oil is released from the sand back into the ocean. We want to avoid that entirely.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The focus should be on safety. It is important that our citizens feel safe, that our coastal water remains beautiful and that our fragile ecosystems are cared for. By increasing the compensation limits we are taking measures to care for people's livelihood. Fishermen need fair compensation to make sure the industry stays strong, and the same applies to tourism. There is a need for help and support from the Government so that people in those industries know that in the case of a disaster they will be taken care of. This Bill will help to provide them with that security. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_246">
          <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_330">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Deputy Kelly has left the House but I am sure the Minister does not have to be reminded of the beautiful coastline of Clare. Like many speakers on the Order of Business this morning, I feel the Bill has been rushed through. I understand it is urgent that we pass the legislation before 1 November but I would have welcomed more debate. Last week we debated the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill, when related matters were discussed, and that Bill also got all-party support in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The purpose of this Bill is to increase by approximately 50% the limits of compensation payable to victims of pollution resulting from persistent spills of oil from tankers into the sea. Compensation is payable in accordance with the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1992 and the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1992. The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Acts gives effect to those conventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">Oil is a very valuable resource and more than 50% of the oil refined in the world has to be transported worldwide by sea. Ireland and Britain are the only countries in the EU with large coastlines with the exception of Malta and Cyprus, which are joining the EU. However, those countries are located in the Mediterranean, where the waters are far quieter. Ireland has a unique geographical location, with our extremely vulnerable coastline and location on the Atlantic seaboard, and the west coast is often pounded by violent storms from the Atlantic that rage throughout the year, particularly in winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The west, south and north coasts are very busy navigational routes with all types of cargo being transported from the US, Europe, Africa, Asia and elsewhere. We have seen the results of many accidents in the past off our coastline. Deputy O'Donovan spoke yesterday about the tragic events of January 1979 when the <i>Betelguese</i> disaster in Bantry Bay caused the death of 51 people, including six locals. We also remember the <i>Amoco Cadiz,</i> which ran aground off the coast of Brittany in March 1978, spilling approximately 69 million tonnes of oil. That disaster is listed as the sixth worst oil spill of all time and could as easily have taken place off the coast of Ireland. My first experience of an oil disaster as a young boy was the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> off the coast of Land's End, which was a terrible disaster at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">We have also had incidents like the <i>Exxon Valdez,</i> which went down in Prince William Sound in Alaska in March 1989. Huge damage was done to wildlife and it took years to recover. However, it was the incident involving the Maltese-registered <i>Erika,</i> again off the coast of Brittany, in December 1999 that led the EU to reassess maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment. That tanker was carrying 31,000 tonnes of heavy oil, almost 20,000 tonnes of which were spilled into the sea. The arrangements which apply at international level regarding liability and compensation in respect of pollution caused by oil tankers are being examined in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The process was given more importance almost 12 months ago with the <i>Prestige </i>incident. We all remember the television pictures of that ship as it broke up on the Spanish coast. It went down fully laden with 77,000 tonnes of fuel, causing international uproar. Many of the famous beaches on Spain's northern coast were threatened and many creatures in the marine environment were injured and killed. Everyone felt sorry for those birds covered in heavy oil, though volunteers tried to help them.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">That was an outrageous incident. Portugal banned the ship from its coastline and at the time European Governments immediately called for a ban on single-hull tankers using the territorial waters of the 15 member states. Now that legislation is in place, it is important that modern vessels for transporting fuel oils are built with a double-skinned hull to ensure that if the outer hull is pierced, the inner hull will prevent a spill. I recall, as the Minister might, that the European Commission published a list of 66 single-hull tankers which were blacklisted at the time. Under European Union rules, 25% of single-hull vessels entering European Union ports must be inspected and the figures for some countries are interesting. The inspection rate in France, where most of the pollution incidents have occurred, was less than 10%. I referred to the two incidents that occurred off the coast of Brittany. The inspection rate in Ireland was 21%, in the UK it was 28% and in Italy it was 43%.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Prevention of oil disasters is far more important than cure and the EU must do more for Ireland because of our geographical location. Ireland must be given adequate funding to put in place a proper coastguard system. My colleague, Mr. John Cushnahan, MEP, has raised this matter at European level on numerous occasions. Ireland needs more ships and long-range helicopters to patrol our seas. Even though this is a small island, we have a long coastline and addressing that need is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Once oil tankers leave territorial waters, they wash out their hulls in international waters. This practice must be stopped as it adds to our pollution problems. One major pollution incident off our coast could destroy our fishing and tourism industries. We are all aware of the importance of the tourism and fishing industries to the west and the south. Our beaches and marine life are special. The beaches in Kerry and Clare, such as Kilkee and Kilrush, and Louisburgh in Mayo are beautiful areas and many films have been made in these locations. The last thing we want is for those beaches to be polluted. The incident that occurred last year involving the <i>Princess Eva,</i> a 22 year old single-hull bulk carrier caused a great scare for the people off the coast of Donegal and for the Government. Unfortunately, two people were killed in that incident and a number of crew members were badly injured. That ship was carrying 55,000 tonnes of heavy oil from Copenhagen to the US when it ran into difficulties off the Donegal coast. Thankfully, the authorities successfully transferred the oil from the stricken ship and they must be congratulated on a job well done. Had that vessel's cargo of 55,000 tonnes of heavy oil leaked into sea, one can imagine the devastation that would have been caused to the north coast of Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">An important question that must be asked about incidents such as that involving the <i>Princess Eva</i> is whether we have the necessary equipment to deal with a potential emergency. We are familiar with the emergencies that occurred off the coast of Brittany and we have been lucky on a number of occasions here. Many speakers referred during the debate last night to the need for Ireland to have an ocean-going tug to deal with such emergencies. That is an excellent idea and the Government should pursue this at every level within the EU. Given the Minister's impending high profile during the EU Presidency, we will have an opportunity in 2004 to highlight our case for requiring an ocean-going tug which could help to divert a potential incident that could create pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">I live alongside the Shannon Estuary, an inland port, where there is a good deal of navigation by vessels serving Limerick, Aughinish Aluminia, Foynes and Moneypoint. Russian aviation fuel is transported on that waterway to the Shannon Aviation Company to serve the airport, which is an important service. A minor incident occurred on the estuary last year but, thankfully, pollution was avoided.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I recall some years ago before I entered politics witnessing a demonstration on the use of booms to prevent oil pollution in the Shannon Estuary. That demonstration involved a Russian company and a local company. Even though that venture did not take off, it was important to see at first hand how oil can be prevented from polluting a coast by booms being put into the sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I welcome the Minister's proposal to increase the compensation for people affected by oil pollution by up to 50%. I understand the total fund will be €290 million. I hope that the genuine victims who apply for compensation following an oil pollution incident will not have to go through a cumbersome, form filing procedure and will get a compensation package to redress the damage caused by pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">I urge that this Bill be implemented quickly. It will serve to alleviate the cost of damage and destruction caused by oil disasters. It is essential to ensure that those involved in oil transportation are asked to pay for any oil clean up, but prevention is better than a cure. I hope the quality of oil tankers operating in Irish waters is monitored – their safety is an important consideration. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_344">Cuireann an Comhaontas Glas fáilte roimh an mBille seo, an Bille um Ola-Thruailliú na Farraige (Dliteanas Sibhialta agus Cúiteamh) (Leasú) 2003, the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">As the Minister said, the object of the Bill is to increase six-fold the limits of compensation available to victims of oil pollution. I note the incentive and motivation for this measure arises from serious incidents, particularly following the <i>Erika</i> oil disaster off the coast of France in December 1999 and other incidents involving the <i>Prestige</i> and other vessels mentioned by previous speakers, which remind us all too well of the catastrophe that can affect an area following an oil disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">I understand from what the Minister said that oil importers in EU members states which import more than 150,000 tonnes of oil a year are to be levied. In an Irish context, such importers included the ESB, the National Petroleum Corporation and Aughinish Aluminia in 2002, as each imported amounts in excess of that limit. However, the Minister also said that he does not anticipate great change. Given that he referred to a six-fold increase in limits of compensation, is it possible to say that no significant change is anticipated, or what type of change will occur as a result of that increase?</p>
          <p eId="para_347">As I stated on the Order of Business, it is important that this debate should focus on where our dependency lies when it comes to oil. That is all the more important, as Deputy Pat Breen mentioned, in regard to the cost of the protection of vessels, whether that be the cost of double-hull vessels or the cost of the regulations that must be complied with. The oil sector has to carry additional costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The difficulty is that the system which operates, generally known as the capitalist system, depends on producing more, on continuous expansion, to survive and on resources which it has to take for granted because it is so dependent on them, but which by their very nature are running out. There is therefore an increasing tension which is manifested by very serious oil incidents involving vessels which have had to cut corners or have had untrained crew, or in the case of the <i>Exxon Valdez,</i> crew which was not in a fit state to operate the tanker. All these human and cost factors start to come into play and very often a disaster is the result.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">It is important that we reflect on that and on the fact that oil by its finite nature will inevitably become more expensive. The demand for cheap oil will clearly continue. Corners have to be cut somehow if cheap oil is to be provided. That must be faced up to and these regulations must be strictly and rigidly implemented so that there is no cutting of corners. That will be the responsibility of the Government, given that there will be huge pressure to cut corners as oil becomes more expensive and we continue to consume more of it every year. Because oil is limited, Government policy needs to reflect the reality that a transition must take place from an oil-dependent society to one more reliant on renewable energy and more energy efficient. In that transition oil will be needed to build wind turbines, wave machines, tidal barrages, solar panels and all the other types of technology that are being developed or are already available, if we were mindful to invest further in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">The Government has not faced up to the transition. We need such a transition to construct energies that go "Beyond Petroleum", as BP now calls itself, a fact which should surely make people realise that even the oil sector knows that the writing is on the wall. In this country more than any other we need to wake up to that message. Some 60% of primary fuel consumption in Ireland is accounted for by oil, whereas in the European Union as a whole, oil accounts for only 43% of energy consumption. The comparable figure in the US is just 40%. It is strange that this country is apparently able to ignore its dependence on oil, when in the future there will be considerable worldwide oil shortages and oil will become more expensive. Our coast too will become more vulnerable as the cost of oil has to be borne by the people transporting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Between 1989 and 2001, oil consumption <i>per capita</i> in Ireland doubled. In the same period in the rest of the European Union, oil consumption remained unchanged. As a country, we are not on top of the job of containing and reducing our dependency on oil. When it comes to economic measurement, for every 1% rise in Irish gross domestic product we have a 1.8% rise in oil consumption. In the European Union as a whole, there is only a 0.6% rise in oil consumption for every 1% rise in gross domestic product.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Rather than trying to reduce our dependency, the Government is blindly endorsing policies that will continue to increase our dependency on oil. If disasters occur as a result of ships coming to Ireland or passing by it, the Government needs to ask why it is continuing to increase oil dependency. Ireland imports nine million tonnes of oil per annum and this figure is expected to grow by 3% per annum. Current policy indicates that by 2008 one can expect to see an oil importation figure of about 12 million tonnes. That points to very serious flaws in the Government in that it does not seem to realise that when it comes to international dependence on oil, the writing is on the wall.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">This Bill is welcome. We want to avoid oil disasters, but by constantly demanding something which is finite and increasingly scarce we are economically pushing those who sell oil to cut corners, because obviously they do no want to increase the price if they avoid doing so. There would be a considerable backlash if they did so. That backlash will come whether by understanding and making a transition or by ignorant revolt and rebellion. A re-evaluation of our dependence on oil will be necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The Minister may be aware of a book I will refer to, but if not I would like to ensure he gets a copy. I am not sure if he is even interested at the moment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_355">I am listening. The Deputy should not worry.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_249">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_356">I am delighted. I wanted to be reassured. The book I want the Minister to be aware of is <i>Before The Wells Run Dry. </i>It will be published tomorrow week and it is important for the Government to take note of it. Hamish McCrea and Colin Campbell, the latter a petro-geologist, now retired and living in Ireland, worked for many of the large oil companies. They are clear in their consensus that in 1964 there was a peak of oil discoveries, indicating that for every five barrels of oil used, only three new barrels are being discovered. That means that while there may currently be oil, less and less will be available in the future. In 2010 these same experts, petro-geologists who know the business very well, say there will be another production peak, after which we will begin to see oil shocks, price increases, supply difficulties and the cutting of corners, which unfortunately makes it all the more likely that oil disasters will occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Some 40% of all energy consumption is currently accounted for by oil, but in terms of transportation, oil accounts for 90%. I ask the Government to reflect on these matters. There is a total lack of awareness of the need to build a transition from an oil dependent economy to a renewable energy and energy efficient economy in the short to medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">We should listen to Deputy Ardagh, who referred to international experiences involving compensation such as is provided for in this Bill being used in a structured and constructive way. The Deputy spoke of a marine conservation centre which benefited from the compensation being paid to victims of oil pollution, which includes the marine environment, possibly indeed the main victim. I cannot recall which country he mentioned but I am sure it is on the record. The Government needs to think about Ireland's position. As an island nation, we do not have a marine conservation centre. We do not have any place where marine animals affected by pollution, be they seals or birds, can be treated and rehabilitated. How serious is this Government about marine conservation when that remains the case?</p>
          <p eId="para_359">One will find a marine conservation centre in Portavogie, England or Belgium. In fact, all EU coastal countries have one, and in some cases more than one, centre. Not alone are such centres important for the rehabilitation of marine life affected by manmade disasters, they are also important tourist attractions. The Government should consider sympathetically, the case being put by the Irish Seal Sanctuary for the location of a marine conservation centre not too far from the Minister's constituency. That organisation has worked voluntarily with local authorities, the Garda Síochána and the many citizens who offer assistance following incidents of oil pollution or marine disasters. How serious is this Government about oil pollution and compensation for victims of oil pollution if it does not provide capital grand aid for such a centre?</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Fingal County Council has provided a much appreciated coastal site north of Balbriggan for the location of such a centre. The site requires the type of capital investment which can only come from Government. If the Government is serious about this legislation, about oil pollution, civil liability and compensation then it has a responsibility to establish at least one marine conservation centre to assist the victims of such disasters. I ask that the Government treat sympathetically the proposal for this centre when it comes before it in whatever guise, be it tourism or whatever. It is projected based on a similar centre north of the Border, that some 60,000 tourists per annum will visit the centre. Otherwise this legislation will be seen as a sham with our having been pushed by the EU and international agreements to make changes in this regard. It will not be seen as having the interests of the Irish marine environment at heart.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The Government should ensure, if it is serious about the marine environment and compensating for oil pollution, that a marine conservation centre is established. It should accept, as a co-operative hint from Fingal County Council, that such a centre is not just needed but is also viable and that it will be a great bonus in terms of international tourism and protection of the marine environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">I commend the Bill and hope the Government can prove its bona fides in that regard by ensuring a marine conservation centre is established.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_250">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_363">I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It is appropriate that my party has contributed more on this Bill which deals with the protection of the marine environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I wish to repeat a criticism made earlier. As party Whip, I feel it needs to be put on the record again. Understanding that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has different legislation dealing with enhancement of the marine environment, we need to put in place, in the context of Dáil reform, a better system providing for a longer lead-in period for discussing and considering legislation such as this before international conventions are ratified. I intend taking up with the party Whips, in terms of the legislative programme introduced by Government, that dates be put on legislation if there is a need to have it ratified internationally. That would allow us to avoid situations like this in the future where we have only a day and a half to discuss Second Stage and must complete Committee Stage during the remainder of the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">We are currently considering numerous Bills from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. As a legislative focus, that is to be welcomed. It indicates a willingness to put in place the legislative means of protecting the marine environment. Later, I will make other criticisms in terms of the willingness to provide the resources to ensure the legislative means are implemented. That is a valid political criticism.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">As a Deputy for Cork South-Central, in which Cork Harbour is an integral part of the community, I have a particular interest in this Bill which seeks to bring Irish legislation into line with best current international practice. It also leaves enormous grey areas with which the international green community has yet to deal. We must place greater emphasis on civil liability and compensation regarding this type of accident. Compensation is needed initially to deal with the effects of the accident on mariculture and to clean-up the disaster. Whether the compensation funds set up and the moneys disbursed can cover the more medium and long-term costs is something we may need to look at again in the future. We must look at issues such as the long-term costs in terms of marine tourism, use of the water and beaches in and around it and how likely compensation is to be put in place. While the Bill provides for a compensation fund, how is it to be accessed? Who will be able to access it and in what circumstances? These are areas which remain to be clarified. Perhaps there will be an opportunity to speak about that during the truncated Committee Stage debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">Much of this debate has been a litany of the major international accidents which have occurred in this area from the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> to the <i>Prestige</i> off the coast of Spain which created a mini-Spanish box of an unwanted type. We had an accident off Milford Haven in the Irish Sea a number of years ago. Given the degree of traffic to and from Ireland and the fact that we are an island nation hugely dependent on oil, we should consider ourselves lucky that more accidents of this type have not occurred in and around our waters. There are real questions about our capacity to deal with such disasters. We must acknowledge that the Irish authorities dealt quite well with such an incident last year. The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> accident a number of years ago frightened many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The thought process which surrounds what potential dangers exist and how they might be dealt with needs to be further refined. When first elected to local government I expressed my fear in regard to the type of traffic coming in and out of Cork Harbour, some of which was oil related and some of which carried cargoes of a more dangerous type. I entered into correspondence with the then harbour master who responded by criticising me and making the argument that we should be moving towards having only double-hulled vessels coming in and out of the harbour. We are moving towards using such vessels. International policy says we must do so. The fact that, even among those responsible for looking after harbours and protecting the marine environment, a case was being made for single-hull vessels in the recent past shows it is an argument that is taking a long time to sink in, pardon the pun. I would like us to move even faster than required under European directives and international conventions in terms of moving to double-hulled vessels. I would like to see certain areas designated as sensitive in terms of the types of traffic allowed to access harbours and waterways. This would pre-empt the legislation by allowing for better than international practice and would avoid these types of accidents in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The ultimate problem with the Bill in terms of civil liability and compensation is that difficulties with flags of convenience continue to haunt the commercial seafaring industry. Many rust buckets are floating on the world's waters because the companies involved are registered in a convoluted way to avoid their responsibilities and costs. The national effort to address this problem can be assisted by international agreements which would help identify those responsible. This will be a test of the effectiveness of the legislation. While I do not doubt the intent of the Bill, these concerns must be placed on record. I look forward to the Government's response.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Many of the companies involved in the excavating, transport and retail of oil products are stateless and multinational. They go from country to country to establish different bases and they try to avoid allegiances and loyalties to any state. It must be asked to what extent international agreements can be put in place to make these companies responsible for what they are likely to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I and my party welcome the Bill as it greatly strengthens the legislation in this area. However, I am concerned at the extent to which the Government will provide the necessary resources to implement its provisions and ensure that accidents of the type referred to do not recur or, if they do, that they are at least properly dealt with. In this regard, I look forward to the Government's position on the use of devises, such as booms in harbours, breakdown agents and fire retardants.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">To assuage public concerns that accidents will be properly dealt with, there must be a clear Government position on the amount of resources to be provided and how they will be used. In the debate on the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill, I said the Irish Coast Guard is an underused resource in terms of watching for and dealing quickly with accidents. The Government should give serious consideration to ensuring it is properly resourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">My party supports the general thrust of the Bill, although we are disappointed with the manner of its introduction to the House. Nevertheless, we encourage the Department to continue to produce legislation of this type to address the many other issues necessary to provide for comprehensive legislation dealing with the protection of the marine environment. The Green Party will be prepared to support the Government if it takes this approach in an effort to ensure such legislation is enacted.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_374">I thank Deputies for their thoughtful and constructive contributions. They have expressed support for the Bill, which the Government is anxious to have passed as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">A number of Deputies referred to the timing of the introduction of the Bill. When preparing it, the Department, while aware of the deadline of 1 November 2003 regarding the application of increased levels of compensation, was conscious of the necessity to introduce legislation to give effect to a number of international instruments with regard to the prevention of pollution from ships. It was considered desirable and most efficient to include all these items in one Bill, if possible. The Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003, a wide-ranging Bill dealing with aspects of the marine environment, was to fulfil this requirement. However, in view of the approaching deadline, the provisions relating to the increased limits were fast-tracked and published separately.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The Bill as published was amended by the Seanad and the amended Bill before the House includes amendments to the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Acts 1988 to 1999, which relate to the supplementary fund protocol. Drafting work had commenced in January 2003 prior the adoption of the protocol at international level but provisions relating to the protocol were not included in the Bill when it was first published. As both sets of provisions involved amendments to the same legislation, it was considered more efficient and rational to include both elements in the same Bill. This explains some of the amendments agreed to in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The purpose of the International Marine Organisation Convention is to mitigate the consequences of major oil pollution incidents involving, in particular, ships, offshore units, seaports and oil handling facilities. The objective is to facilitate international co-operation and mutual assistance in preparing for and responding to a major oil pollution incident and to encourage states to develop and maintain an adequate capability to deal with oil pollution emergencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act 1999 implemented the 1990 international convention on oil pollution preparedness, response and co-operation and provides for pollution plans to be in place for Ireland's ports and for a national contingency plan. Progress is being made to proceed with the national oil spill contingency plan and the approval of harbour plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">In the event of a major pollution incident, the Irish Coast Guard is responsible for the direction and co-ordination of the sea and on-shore response. In the context of the incident involving the tanker <i>Prestige</i> and a similar incident happening off Ireland's coast, the following would apply: notification of the incident would be received through the Irish Coast Guard marine communications network; Irish Coast Guard search and rescue helicopters can be used for air surveillance for small incidents during daylight hours while for other oil spillage incidents, tracking would be contracted from outside the country. The Irish Coast Guard has computer modelling decision support systems to predict the fate and behaviour of the oil spill. Intervention on the scene would be by way of contracting suitable tugs, on the domestic or European market. Salvage expertise is available within the resources of the Irish Coast Guard marine and safety directorate while incident co-ordination would be carried out by the Irish Coast Guard marine rescue co-ordination centre and locally by a joint response centre, JRC, set up specifically to deal with the incident. The JRC would bring together local authorities, environmental experts and response operations personnel to respond to an incident.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">A number of Deputies referred to the importance of response equipment. The Irish Coast Guard does not own pollution response vessels, but is in a position to obtain them from our European neighbours. The coast guard has tier three national pollution equipment stockpiles in Dublin, Killybegs and Castletownbere. A pool of trained personnel who have attended national training courses from harbour and local authorities can also be called upon. The coast guard also has contracts with specialist companies dealing with oil spill responses to provide equipment and personnel in the event of a tier three response.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">In response to a specific point raised by a Deputy, a private company based in Cork owns a tug which normally operates out of the Shannon estuary. The vessel is normally used for berthing large vessels in the estuary. For example, it was used during the <i>Princess Eva</i> incident.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The Irish Coast Guard maintains close links with the EU Commission civil protection and environmental accident unit, which can call for immediate assistance should an event similar to the <i>Prestige</i> occur in the Irish pollution responsibility zone. As a result of this co-operation, the coast guard sent 1,200 metres of boom and oil recovery equipment to Spain to assist its authorities with the <i>Prestige </i>incident. Ireland is in the process of acceding to the Bonn agreement between north European countries, which provides for mutual support on marine pollution incidents. Ireland is also a member of the EU marine pollution management committee, which provides experts and support drawn from other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Recently, the Irish Coast Guard received funding to provide for a marine pollution and salvage section in its operation unit. The coast guard has in the past successfully responded to all incidents and the handling of the <i>Princess Eva</i> incident was not only down to good luck but also good management. This year the coast guard has successfully responded to nine incidents involving vessels that posed a threat of marine pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">A number of Members raised the issue of an emergency towing vessel. The primary role of such a vessel is to provide a towing service to minimise oil pollution of the coastline resulting from drift strandings. If there is an oil spillage, the emergency towing vessel can also act as a response vessel by deploying booms and other skimmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">In May 1998 an emergency towing vessel study was commissioned by the Government. The study was published in May 1999 and in May 2000 the Government agreed in principle to the recommendations of the study to provide an emergency towing vessel. A memorandum is being prepared for Government with a view to recommending the procurement of such a vessel for south west approaches and the Irish Sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Single-hull tankers were also referred to by a number of Members. The Minister outlined details of the procedures for the phasing out of single-hull tankers in his contribution. The international nature of shipping requires that in order for action in this regard to be effective, it should be taken by groups of countries rather than by small countries individually. We therefore support measures at EU and international level to deal with single-hull tankers.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Deputy Sean Ryan sought clarification on the PSSA request. This request was considered by the MEPC in July 2003. It agreed, in principle, to the request for designation and referred the matter to an expert navigation committee for examination. The committee is expected to report to the MEPC next year. The MEPC did not accede to the request to ban tankers as proposed. It is open to the states concerned to introduce other protective measures. Proposals in this regard are under consideration by the officials and experts concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Deputy Sargent raised the issue of a marine conservation centre and I will take this up with the relevant section in my Department, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and others involved. The Deputy would be happy if such a centre was successful and it would also attract many tourists.</p>

          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_397">I welcome this long overdue development in housing legislation. My party has called for the Government to act in light of the changes in the housing market. This is groundbreaking legislation, as it provides that people who have been renting for six months without causing problems have the right to a five year lease and rent can only be increased once a year. There must be greater security of tenure for tenants because thousands more people have entered the private rented sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The need for reform of this sector has long been recognised. The Bill has been published against a background where the percentage of housing stock available for rent has increased from 8% to 13%. This increase is all the more notable because the total number of units has soared.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The housing market is completely different from that which my party left in 1997. At that time students could find accommodation relatively easily and could hope that they would own a property one day. However, the rented sector is now a more realistic option because of exorbitant increases in house prices. Home ownership, still the goal of many, may have to be put off by them for many years. The facts are startling. The first-time buyer's grant has been abolished, as a result of which the little respite offered to young people to help to put a roof over their heads has been taken away. Fine Gael objected to its abolition and it was a major disappointment as young people sometimes used it to purchase a fitted kitchen or a suite of furniture. There has been much debate about encouraging people regarding home ownership and this grant was an important factor. I was extremely disappointed, given the significant increase in VAT which has impacted significantly on the price of a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The average price of a new home is €225,000, which is 25% higher than in the US, and this represents an unbelievable increase of 180% since 1996. A total of 12,000 people contacted Threshold during the period the Commission on the Private Rented Sector held its meetings. Most of them highlighted frequent and substantial rent increases. Health boards pay rent supplement to 100,000 people. Tenants have poor security of tenure while many landlords feel policy is framed on the basis of poor information.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Almost 500 people are on the housing waiting list of Sligo Corporation while a similar number is on the Sligo County Council waiting list. Almost 1,000 people are following the necessary procedures but many of them will have years to wait. That is disappointing and that is the reason the legislation is necessary. Rented accommodation will be a factor for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">People who have no income are in the greatest need of housing. The housing statistics bulletin states 5,581 people are homeless.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_258">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_404">My Department's Reception and Integration Agency, the RIA, is responsible, among other things, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers. Purchases of property under the asylum seeker accommodation programme are dealt with by the Office of Public Works, acting on behalf of the agency. Since 1999, the Office of Public Works has purchased ten properties, leased one site and developed two system-built centres and three mobile home sites for the purpose of accommodating asylum seekers. Over the same period, the RIA has entered into commercial contracts for service arrangements with the owners of more than 100 properties for the same purpose. All of the facilities, with the exception of four properties and one leased site, have been or are currently in use to accommodate asylum seekers. Approximately 31,000 asylum seekers have been accommodated to date and related services have been provided for them by the RIA. The current daily average number of asylum seekers being accommodated by the RIA is 6,000, which equates to 42,000 bed nights per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">There was some controversy and significant local opposition in respect of the use of the four properties and one leased site which, regrettably, remain unoccupied for the purpose of accommodating asylum seekers. The properties in question are four of a total of 120 properties procured nationwide for this purpose. Similar difficulties were experienced with other properties, but these difficulties were addressed through compromise in most cases. Compromise proved to be elusive, however, in respect of the four properties which had been purchased and the leased site. The properties, two of which are former hotels – the other two being a retreat centre and a hostel, are located in Rosslare, Macroom, Donnybrook and Myshall. The leased site is located at Leggetsrath in County Kilkenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Sustained and repeated efforts were made to address the concerns of local residents in the areas where the properties and the site are located. Local interests in Macroom and in Donnybrook have exercised their right to challenge the use of the properties in the courts on planning grounds. The State is defending the planning permission in respect of these two properties and the matter awaits determination by the High Court. The development of the leased site in County Kilkenny has also been halted pending the outcome of judicial review proceedings on planning matters relating to it. It would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time in such circumstances, as I do not want to compromise current High Court litigation. I can say, however, that the RIA acted at all times in accordance with the legal advice of the Attorney General in respect of planning matters relating to these and all other properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"><i>Additional Information.</i>I will deal with the remaining two properties. Following the purchase in early 2000 of the property at Myshall in County Carlow for use as an accommodation centre for asylum seekers, representations were made by the South-Eastern Health Board and the Irish Society for Autism seeking to have the property made available for use as a residential service for children with disabilities who require specialist care. There was strong local opposition to the use of this property to accommodate asylum seekers. In these circumstances, the Office of Public Works was informed in March 2001 that the RIA had no objections to the property being made available to the South-Eastern Health Board for use as a centre for these children.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The property at Rosslare Harbour was purchased in April 2000 for use as a reception centre for all asylum seekers arriving in Rosslare. The situation in Rosslare had become critical at that time because the number of asylum seekers arriving at the port was almost equal to the number making claims at Dublin Airport. The Devereux Hotel in Rosslare presented a ready-made solution. The fact that it was available for immediate occupation was a key factor, given the numbers arriving at the port. Due to the introduction of a number of initiatives by the Garda National Bureau of Immigration in co-operation with the French immigration authorities, however, the number of applicants fell from almost 1,500 in 2000 to less than 100 in 2001. The number of applicants in Rosslare has remained very low since then. There was intense local opposition to the use of the premises as accommodation for asylum seekers, notwithstanding the fall-off in numbers applying at Rosslare, and a 24 hour picket was placed on them. It was made clear that any attempt to accommodate asylum seekers would be resisted to the point of physically blocking the entrance. In September 2001, the Office of Public Works was advised that, in the light of the completely altered circumstances in Rosslare, the property was no longer required to accommodate newly arrived asylum seekers. I understand that the Office of Public Works conducted a trawl of all Departments with a view to establishing whether it could be utilised for other purposes. No such alternative use was identified and the property was sold by the Office of Public Works earlier this year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_259">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_409">I want to home in on the properties mentioned by the Minister, which were acquired at a cost of €19 million. The 25-bedroom Devereux Hotel in Rosslare, which was acquired in March 2001 at a cost of €2.74 million, was subsequently sold in July 2003 for €1.8 million. The security costs associated with the property amounted to almost €500,000. The site at Leggetsrath was leased in March 2002 for €184,000 per annum. A contract was entered into to provide portable housing at the site at a cost of €6.56 million. Some €2.5 million has been expended on this site to date. I wonder if the Minister can tell me if the contractor has done any work for that money. Broc House in Donnybrook, which is idle at present, was purchased for €9.2 million. The security costs associated with the property to date come to €500,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">There is a long lost of sites, but the one I would like to discuss is the Devereux Hotel in Rosslare, which was bought for €2.74 million and sold for €1.8 million. Some serious questions need to be asked about the valuation process. Have any such questions been asked within the Department? How could one lose €1 million on a hotel in the property market of the last few years? Some of the excuses that have been provided in this regard are hard to accept. The low selling price has been attributed to the absence of a special purpose purchaser, the foot and mouth disease crisis and the effects of the loss of goodwill and trade during the period when the property was not used as an hotel. The claim that there has been a general deterioration in the market for this type of property is very hard to believe. It is a complete fiasco.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">When one examines the figures in this regard, one finds that about €20 million is involved. Given that it costs about €50,000 to recruit a garda, some 400 extra gardaí could be recruited for the sum of money in question. The Minister is constantly complaining that he does not have the resources for extra gardaí. He had the extra resources, but he and his Department squandered them. The Office of Public Works has squandered money left, right and centre. I have given a practical example of what could have been done with the money. It could have been spent on recruiting gardaí who are needed on the streets.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_260" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_412">The implication of the Deputy's comments is that I made the decisions he has mentioned. He is aware that I did not make the decisions, however, as they were made and put into effect before I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Deputy Deasy's implication that I have in some way made decisions that have cost the taxpayer money is an incorrect and unfounded one. I share the Deputy's concern that a property purchased by the State yielded a significant loss in value when sold at a proximate date. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform relies on the valuations it receives from the Office of Public Works in respect of these matters. The Office of Public Works is the State agency trusted by the various line Departments to give expert and qualified advice on properties purchased.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">It should be borne in mind that Ireland was inundated by a totally unexpected phenomenon, a wave of refugees, when these purchases were made during the term of the previous Government. Decisions had to be made very quickly in such circumstances in order to accommodate the refugees. The fairly stark alternative was to leave refugees on the streets, in hallways or under cardboard boxes in our cities. It was for the Government of the day to make decisions to accommodate the wholly unanticipated phenomenon of a sudden influx of people into Ireland, which had, until 1997, been a country of net emigration where this phenomenon had not been experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Decisions were made to purchase premises across the country. In some cases the policy decisions which underlay the purchases were taken to make sure that these premises were not concentrated in a particular part of the country but were spread fairly across various locations regardless of the socio-economic status of the inhabitants. In those circumstances some properties may have been purchased at an over-value and the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform operated in the face of an emergency. It acted in good faith to prevent people from being forced to live in the open and it did so on the basis of expert valuations tendered to it and not otherwise. The implication of the Deputy's question, that I have made decisions which have amounted to the spending of money on this issue which could have been spent on other things, is not correct. I have faced up to the situations which I have found myself dealing with and in a number of cases, as the Deputy is well aware, I am awaiting the decision of the courts. I cannot walk away from the courts or throw the properties back at the purchasers.</p>

      <b>Mr. Costello</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
      if his attention has been drawn to the serious concern expressed by the Garda representative organisations, journalists and media outlets at the provision under head 26 of the scheme of the Garda Síochána Bill 2003, which would leave members of the force at risk of a penalty of up to five years in jail for the disclosure to anyone of virtually any information they may come across; the evidence he has to substantiate claims he made publicly that journalists bribed members of the Garda to acquire information; if he will withdraw this section; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [23466/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_423">The vast majority of members of the Garda Síochána perform their duties to the highest standards. However, as in any organisation of 11,900 members, a small number can abuse the trust placed in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The purpose of head 26 is to address serious concerns about unauthorised disclosures of information to the media by a very small number of gardaí. Such disclosures are not acceptable in any professional police service as they can frustrate criminal investigations and prosecutions, lead to a breakdown in the public's confidence and trust and constitute a gross and unnecessary invasion of the privacy of victims of crime. They can also expose the taxpayer to the payment of substantial damages.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">My concerns about such disclosures were originally raised by a previous Attorney General, Mr. David Byrne, who is now the EU Commissioner. Mr. Byrne communicated with the previous Garda Commissioner on the matter in 1999. The commissioner for his part indicated that it would be of considerable assistance to the Garda Síochána if the law were strengthened to facilitate the proper investigation of wrongful disclosures of confidential information by applying to such cases the detention provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1984. That Act provides for the detention and questioning of suspects arrested for offences carrying a penalty of five years imprisonment or more. Representatives of a number of Garda associations have also made it clear that they do not condone unauthorised disclosures of information by members of the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">It is important that no matter how infrequent the incidence of disclosure of confidential information by individual members of the Garda Síochána, the law must be visibly adequate to the task of deterring or, where it occurs, dealing with such behaviour, especially given the highly confidential and intimate nature of the information held by the force on victims of crime and others. Persons who make statements in confidence to the Garda Síochána concerning their intimate private affairs should not have their privacy violated.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">For these reasons I have included in the general scheme of the Garda Síochána Bill 2003 a provision on the prevention of the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information from within the force. In making this proposal, I have made clear that it is not intended in any way to interfere with normal and proper relations between the force and the media. In publishing the general scheme in advance of the finalisation of the Bill itself my aim was to facilitate public debate and consultation. The Deputy was present when the scheme of the Bill was discussed recently by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. I have received some views from bodies and members of the public directly and I am well aware that head 26 in particular has attracted a significant amount of media attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">When the general scheme was published I indicated that head 26 was overly widely drawn and would need to be reined in in certain respects. I have indicated in public, and I will answer a supplementary question on this point if the Deputy wishes to know, the circumstances in which I think it should be reduced in its scope.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">Head 26 says that members of the Garda Síochána will not be able to communicate or disclose information to any person whatsoever. The Minister's proposed action on this issue is excessive. He should withdraw this head and begin again.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Arising from head 26 the Minister accused journalists of bribing the gardaí who were giving them information. That accusation was made strongly and trenchantly and has cast a slur on the media and the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">What is required is a code of good practice in the Garda Síochána. Such a code could be included in the mission statement, or vision statement, which the Minister proposes to include in the Garda Síochána Bill. It could be displayed in every Garda station and be part of a small charter which gardaí could carry with them. The Minister should follow that measure with the proposed statutory press council where the standards in the press would be examined. This has also been promised. The Minister should go a further step and accept the whistleblowers' Bill, which was introduced by the Labour Party in 1999 to allow for the proper disclosure of information which civic-minded public servants need to disclose in serious occasions of wrongdoing. The Minister should approach this question in a meaningful way rather than use a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.</p>

          <p eId="para_434">The note included in the draft scheme of the Bill, from which Deputy Costello was going to quote in a disorderly manner, states that the precise scope of the provision, and in particular whether there was need to provide for exemptions, would be considered further during the drafting stage of the Bill. I have already publicly indicated that I recognise the need for a targeting of the provision to address the key areas of concern, such as where the unlawful disclosure seriously violates the privacy and dignity of any individual, tends to prejudice the fair investigation or trial of a serious offence, tends to compromise the security of the vital interests of the State or is made for reward. I have also indicated, as the Deputy is aware, that I would not envisage the offence being committed by any person who acts in good faith to prevent a wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">I reject the suggestion made by the Deputy that I have cast a slur on members of the Garda Síochána in general or on members of the media in general.</p>

          <p eId="para_437">The activities of a handful of people out of a force of 11,900 are not a slur on the vast majority who do their work very well, keep their confidences and observe the rights of individuals with whom they are dealing to the letter of the law. However, when confronted with clear evidence that material is leaked in circumstances which are highly prejudicial to individuals, to the prosecution of offences or to the interests of the State by a handful of people within the force, there must be something more than a code of good conduct. It is not just a question of good conduct but of upholding the criminal law.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">As things stand, there is a very widely drawn offence under the Official Secrets Act which every garda swears upon oath not to commit. I intend to narrow the focus of the existing offence and to increase the penalty in order that those who do real harm and think they can get away with it will be deterred from doing so in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_448">I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 62 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">As the House will be aware, the Prison Service has, for some time, been in negotiation with the Prison Officers' Association on a new deal to enhance significantly the operational efficiency of our prisons and reduce costs, particularly overtime costs. The package of measures under negotiation does not refer to any proposal for privatised prisons. The present focus of the proposals is to enable publicly managed prisons to deliver an efficient and effective service, which is what the taxpayer and the people deserve. The Prison Officers' Association is due to ballot its members on the proposals very shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The existing cost of the Prison Service is unsustainable. In the absence of agreement, the Government will decide urgently on measures which it has recently discussed to significantly reduce costs in the service. It would not be helpful or appropriate for me to outline at this time the measures that will be considered by Government if agreement cannot be reached with the Prison Officers' Association by the end of this month. I very much hope that agreement can be reached very soon and that the necessary progress can be made on the basis of consensus.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_451">The Minister is being clever in his answer. In May, at the conference of the Prison Officers' Association, he said: "If I had to secure capital investment from outside Exchequer sources for the prison system, I would consider doing so."  On 22 August the <i>Evening Herald</i> reported that a radical plan existed to privatise prisons. The following day, the director of the Prison Service, Seán Aylward, confirmed that there was a contingency plan to hand over prisons to private operators and to close at least four smaller jails if the talks proved unsuccessful. On 19 and 22 September, the director confirmed that he was considering the privatisation of some of the functions of the service, such as the escorting of prisoners, and that the privatisation of prisons had not been ruled out. On 24 September the Minister said in the <i>Irish Independent</i> that he would not privatise prisons except as a last resort.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">More recently, on 3 October, in response to a direct question he only confirmed, cleverly, that the Government offer to the Prison Officers' Association does not refer to prison privatisation. Does a contingency plan exist in the Department to privatise prisons? Is the director of the Prison Service spoofing or lying? Has the Minister definitely ruled out prison privatisation? A straight answer is required.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_453">I reject the imputation against the honesty and integrity of the director of the Prison Service, who is doing a wonderful job to bring about change that has been needed for so long and which is now about to occur. On the quotations the Deputy has strung together, if he examined carefully each link in his chain of evidence, he would find that each of them is flawed. For instance, what I said to the prison officers in Galway was that if I had to secure capital for the Prison Service from outside the Exchequer, I would do so. Capital expenditure on prisons does not involve running or maintaining prisons, which involve a current item of expenditure. The point I made to the prison officers was that the current pattern of cannibalising the State's budget for capital development in prisons to pay for massively excessive overtime is unsustainable and will not continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I can state categorically to the Deputy that there is no plan in my Department to privatise the Prison Service. I reiterate that our priority is to run a decent prison service as a State service and to do so within a containable budget. There may well be circumstances in which individual functions, which are now carried out by the State in respective prisons, could be carried out by others. One example would be a public private partnership to construct any new prison accommodation. Other examples include the escorting of prisoners to and from courts and maintenance and service facilities within prisons, such as stores. I will consider all these things, but it must be emphasised that it is my preference that the Prison Service be run, if possible, as a State service by officers employed by the State and subject to the control of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The partial diversion of the capital budget of the Prison Service into paying for excessive overtime, which has been the case for some years, must not continue. The prison officers have been given a fair deal. They are now balloting on it and I hope they will accept it. It must be made clear to all concerned that the present circumstances are unsustainable and I will take action to prevent them from continuing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_456">It seems there is certainly an agenda at play on this issue. The prison at Shanganagh in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area has been closed. We are told that it will be sold to raise funds for the Prison Service. There are remarks on the public record about the possible sale of Mountjoy Prison and its moving to somewhere on the M50, no doubt adjacent to the proposed national stadium.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">There is a serious concern that this is privatisation by stealth. When one talks about the possible privatisation of the transportation of prisoners, is this not the thin end of the wedge? Where will it end? If one privatises some of the services of the Prison Service, one will be implementing privatisation by stealth. This means that profit, rather than the welfare of prisoners, will be the guiding motive. We need look no further than across the water to the United Kingdom to see the dangerous precedent of even partial privatisation. When partial privatisation was introduced there ten or 15 years ago, it was regarded as impinging on only a small part of the prison service. The United Kingdom now has the most privatised prison system in Europe. Does the Minister perceive it to be a success, bearing in mind that prison officers in the privatised service have been charged, on many accounts, of not looking after the welfare of prisoners?</p>
          <p eId="para_458">We need a clear answer regarding whether the Minister considers the tendering of transportation services to be partial privatisation. Does he regard the selling off of certain prison lands as simply being a way to improve the existing prisons or is it a move towards more complete privatisation?</p>

          <p eId="para_461">The optimal position, over which I stand, is that prisoners be accommodated in prisons governed by the State and staffed by the State through its own officers. However, there is room for improvement and more economical practices in respect of some areas of support services for the Prison Service or incidental services on the periphery of its core activities. It would be a dereliction of my duty to the taxpayer if I did not address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The fundamental question the Deputy raises about the future of individual prison campuses is different. If I have to relocate the Mountjoy Prison – I emphasise that no decision has been taken in this regard – it will be entirely without prejudice as to whether such an institution would be built on a public private partnership basis. My preference, of which prison officers should be aware, is that the Prison Service should continue to be staffed by officers of the State. If this is made impossible, I will confront the matter. In the meantime, I urge everybody to attempt to arrive at consensus to allow prisoners to be cared for in State-controlled, run and owned prison facilities in which the officers who look after prisoners are public servants.</p>

There is no such danger and the suggestion is fanciful. I have clearly set out my policy preference. I ask other people, particularly the members of the Prison Officers' Association, to make it possible for me to provide for the taxpayer and community at large a Prison Service within reasonable economic cost boundaries. This is not currently the case, but it will be, in one way or another. I ask that it be achieved by way of agreement and consensus, rather than confrontation.</p>

      <b>Mr. Deasy</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
      the steps he plans to take to redress the high level of sick leave as identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General among prison officers.
      [23503/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_290">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_466">I welcome the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the management of sick leave in prisons. While the rostered nature of Prison Service employment poses difficulties in comparing sick absence levels of prison staff with those of other civil servants and high levels of sick absence are also a feature of prison service employment in other countries, notably the United Kingdom, I am determined to take decisive steps to address the problem of high sick leave absence levels in the Prison Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">There is evidence that a small number of prison officers – I make no slur against the body of prison officers – contribute disproportionately to the overall level of sick leave. Where the actual number of absences is low, this derives, in some cases, from the serious nature of an officer's illness. Where high sick leave levels derive from a high number of absences, however, there are more grounds to suspect that an officer is abusing sick leave arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">As indicated in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Prison Service adopts a systematic approach to reviewing sick leave absence records of staff. During 2001 and 2002 this approach had to be put on hold while an officer sought a judicial review in the High Court of the decision of the Prison Service to withdraw the privilege of sick leave with pay in his case. The outcome of this review, in December 2002, upheld the approach of the Prison Service and has enabled it to reinstate its systematic approach. Already this effort is bearing fruit in terms of reduced sick absence levels in a number of prisons where staff absence records have been reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Even with this systematic review of staff absences, however, I acknowledge that further steps must be taken to address this issue and ensure that absence levels do not begin to drift back up to the levels of recent years, as highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report. The guaranteed hours procedure, which I have proposed to introduce in place of overtime, will have the effect, on an annual hours basis, of offering less of an incentive for the minority of prison officers who are seriously abusing the current system to attempt to continue to do so. The package on the table will address, in large measure, the temptation for a small minority of prison officers in the past to greatly abuse the current sick leave arrangements.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_470">Members will agree that the figures on sick leave in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General are staggering. The report found that €55 million was spent on prison officers' overtime in 2002, while officers took more than 60,000 days sick leave, an average of around 19 days each in 2002. Cork Prison recorded double the national average while the figure for Arbour Hill was well below average. The Comptroller and Auditor General asked whether specific institutional or management factors at work in Arbour Hill contributed to the prison's relatively low rate of sick leave. He also noted that the system employed to record sick leave was deficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The cost of sick leave in 2001 was €8.6 million, twice the Civil Service average. This massive sum, €16 million or €17 million over four years, is a terrible waste of money. I reiterate my earlier calculation that €20 million would cover the cost of recruiting and training 300 to 400 gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Given that the Government squandered the resources available for the area of criminal justice during the past six or seven years and the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties allowed the current position to develop, responsibility for this matter must lie with the Minister. He talks a great deal inside and outside the Chamber and twice today stated he would take decisive action with regard to prison officers. We will see what this entails given that the Government is responsible for the current mess in which resources are not available to invest in criminal justice.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">I welcome the support of the Deputy for the steps I am taking. I am glad at least one party is nailing its colours firmly to the mast and agreeing that I must tackle this matter. If it comes to a crunch, I will expect his party to follow through with its support.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">With regard to the €55 million spent on prison officers' overtime, it should be borne in mind that the figure is distributed among 3,300 staff, whereas a comparable figure is distributed among 11,900 gardaí. This begs the question as to the reason such a culture arose and has been tolerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Deputy Deasy has the great luxury of being a late entrant to the House which allows him to castigate one Government only for the current position. The blame runs much further back. If the Deputy examines the record carefully, he will find that no effective action was ever taken by his party on the odd occasion it had responsibility for this matter.</p>

      the reason there are such delays in dealing with applications by members of the Garda Síochána under the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts; the longest such delay within his Department; and if such applications will be dealt with properly.
      [23204/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_481">The Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts 1941 and 1945 provide for a scheme of compensation for members of the Garda Síochána who are maliciously injured in the course of their duty or in relation to the performance of their duties as members of the Garda Síochána and for the dependants of members who have died from injuries maliciously inflicted on them. Under section 6 of the 1941 Act, a member of the Garda Síochána who has been maliciously injured may sue the State only by an authorisation issued by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Before deciding if an applicant should be authorised to apply to the High Court for compensation in respect of the injury, the practice has been for the Minister to consider all medical reports submitted by the applicant together with a report on the incident by the Garda Commissioner and a report on the injury by the chief medical officer of the Garda Síochána. Members are referred to the Garda chief medical officer as soon as a final medical report has been submitted by their solicitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">There are approximately 1,100 applications for compensation being processed under the Acts at present. Approximately 420 of these applications are at an early stage of processing in that various reports have yet to be furnished. There are approximately 334 cases for which final medical reports have been received and for which applicants are awaiting examination by the Garda chief medical officer, approximately 250 cases where the member has been examined by the Garda chief medical officer and the commissioner is preparing a report for submission to the Department and approximately 130 cases for which the commissioner's reports, including the Garda chief medical officer's report, have been provided and for which a decision as to the granting of an authorisation is required. The Chief State Solicitor's office reports that there are approximately 58 cases with that office awaiting a High Court hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">In 1997 a committee was established to review the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána compensation Acts. It reported and it is my intention in the near future to establish a Garda Síochána compensation tribunal rather than continue with the High Court, from whose decision there is no appeal. I am confident that the Garda staff associations will co-operate with this legislative change.</p>

          <p eId="para_485">The Minister did not reply to my question about the longest delay in cases held up by his Department. The Minister talks about responsibility in other matters but does he not accept responsibility for these delays? Many of these cases were submitted years ago. They go from the Department to the Chief State Solicitor's office and to the Office of the Attorney General. The Minister has had an input in dealing with these matters for the past six years. Does he not accept it is unfair and outrageous that applicants can be held up for six years when awaiting an authorisation to have their claims disposed of?</p>
          <p eId="para_486">If, for example, one of the two brave young gardaí who foiled the raid on Charlie Chawke had lost his leg, would the Minister not consider it outrageous that in six years that garda would still be awaiting the Minister's authorisation to go to court to seek the legitimate compensation to which he would be entitled and to recover damages for injuries received while serving this country? Does he not accept that there are many such instances? The Minister's reply today is virtually the same reply that was issued by the then Minister two years ago when this question was raised.</p>

          <p eId="para_489">If my reply had been different, the Deputy would have been the first to point out that I was contradicting my predecessor. I am glad there is a tyranny of consistency here.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">There are number of reasons for delay. One of them is the procedure I have described, which is unnecessarily convoluted. It would be better to replace it by a tribunal which would not be a High Court driven operation but would decide these issues in a faster and more effective way. I agree there must be reform and I hope to do that in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">On some occasions, not the majority, the applications are delayed. The Deputy asked about the greatest ever delay. In one case the Minister consented to a late application for compensation by a member of the Garda 27 years after the injury was sustained. The record, therefore, is a 27 year old application. That was done because the member of the Garda was given special consideration to bring a case after that length of time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_302">
          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_492">That is not the matter about which I asked. I am asking about a member of the force who was injured while on duty, has applied for compensation and for whom an authorisation has not been issued by the Minister to enable that garda to claim compensation. I am aware of a garda who was injured during a riot in Dublin in 1997 and who has been seeking to have the claim disposed of but cannot get the authorisation from the Minister's office to enable the case to proceed. In another case of which I am aware, the incident in which the serious injuries were incurred happened in 1998. Is it fair or just that people who are injured while on duty should be delayed for years when seeking compensation because of these procedures?</p>
          <p eId="para_493">With regard to the tribunal, the current procedures are ridiculous. It is utterly ridiculous to have to go to the High Court when somebody breaks a finger or the like when the matter could be settled in a five minute phone call between the solicitor and the Chief State Solicitor if such a process was available. Does the Minister not accept that the tribunal he refers to was recommended six years ago, but nothing has happened. Why? The Minister had responsibility during that time either as Attorney General or as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Is there a deliberate policy on the part of the Government to delay the claims because there is not enough money in the fund to pay them or as a deterrent to applicants?</p>

      <b>Mr. S. Ryan</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
      his views on the recent criticism of his record in office by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [23385/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_331">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_523">I had a very useful meeting on 25 September with the Lord Mayor of Dublin and councillors Frances Fitzgerald, Vincent Jackson and Dermot Lacey. As I mentioned in a previous reply on 30 September, we discussed, among other issues, the work of the Garda Síochána and my Department regarding crime detection and prevention and how Dublin City Council might contribute to making Dublin a safer city.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">As I mentioned at the meeting, the Garda authorities have put a number of new initiatives in place to deal with anti-social behaviour in Dublin. Among them is a new city centre policing initiative which was launched on 9 June 2003 by Assistant Garda Commissioner Kevin Carthy for the Dublin metropolitan region. That initiative provides high visibility policing presence in specific target areas in the north and south inner city centre areas. It targets issues of concern such as public order, assaults, street theft, shoplifting, addicts, beggars and general vagrancy. Another Garda initiative, Operation Boulevard – a name I would not have chosen myself – targets anti-social behaviour in the environs of O'Connell Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2002 gives the Garda Síochána additional powers when dealing with anti-social behaviour. In addition, all sections of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 have been in operation since 29 September 2003. As Deputies know, the latest provisions deal with earlier closing times on Thursdays, grant licensees discretion to exclude certain young persons from bars and oblige persons aged between 18 and 20 to carry an age document if they wish to purchase alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Rather than go on too long, and to allow time for the Deputies, I wish to emphasise that the interaction with Dublin City Council is something that I very much welcome. I have put in place in the Garda Síochána Bill provision for a formalised link between elected local government representatives and the Garda Síochána in their areas. It is very important that local government representatives have a real and constructive input, and a formal basis for having that input, with the Garda Síochána. I emphasise that traffic will not be one way. It will not just be a whinge list for the Garda about the inadequacies of policing, because many of the problems that exist in Dublin arise from decisions by successive city councils and corporations regarding planning matters and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">People talk about CCTV, but a British Home Office survey showed that adequate street lighting is as effective in deterring criminality in any given area.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"><i>Additional information.</i>I am confident that these reforms will improve compliance with, and enforcement of, the licensing laws. The many structural reforms to the licensing system recommended by the Commission on Liquor Licensing will be addressed in the codification of the licensing code. I expect that an outline of a codification Bill will be available by the middle of 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">As the Deputy will be aware, the preliminary draft scheme of the Garda Síochána Bill 2003 made public on 30 July contains a number of measures on the organisation, management, performance and accountability of the Garda Síochána aimed at improving the efficient and effective use of Garda resources. The publication of the preliminary draft scheme allows all concerned, and the public at large, the opportunity to take part in the consultative process that will inform the drafting process of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">As the city council recognises, the responsibility for crime prevention and enforcement cannot rest solely on the Garda and the wider criminal justice system. Local authorities also have their role to play. The Garda Síochána Bill therefore proposes a formalised consultation process in the form of local policing committees which will formulate and oversee the implementation of measures of co-operation between the local authority and the Garda aimed at reducing crime and disorder and combating the misuse of alcohol and drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">With regard to concern regarding recent gang-related deaths, the term "gangland killing" or "organised crime" is widely used by the media in referring to the nature of certain serious crimes, including unlawful killings. It is often qualified by the suggestion that the victim was "known to gardaí". While that speculation is understandable, it does not correspond to the manner in which the Garda Síochána classifies crime or individual offences. As I have said before in this House, it does not influence gardaí or deter them from their investigation of those crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I have had a number of meetings with the Garda Commissioner and other senior Garda personnel to discuss crimes which might be put in the category of gangland or organised crime. I am satisfied that the necessary resources, both financial and operational, are being directed towards the containment and detection of such serious criminal activity. I have also confirmed to the Garda authorities my willingness to consider any further measures which they feel would assist in addressing the problem.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_332">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_533">Whatever the Minister's desire for interaction with Dublin City Council, my question was about his interaction with the Lord Mayor of the city council and the city. The Minister chose as usual to avoid the question in his answer. He went off on a red herring and chased a hare somewhere down that boulevard about which he was talking. The Lord Mayor criticised the Minister's record on crime as showing complete contempt for the city and giving it the two fingers. He called the Minister an arrogant bully boy who had said that he would not meet him to discuss crime. That is the question that I asked the Minister. He may have wonderful ideas, but he has been keeping them to himself as far as the Lord Mayor is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The Lord Mayor is the first citizen of the city, after all, and he got no reply for three or four weeks to a letter which he sent the Minister and then received a nondescript reply without an intention on the Minister's part to meet him. He went to the media, as the Minister is himself accustomed to do from time to time. Did the Minister threaten to resign because of his remarks? Did he go to the Tánaiste and ask her to extract an abject apology from the Lord Mayor – which he gave? Why can the Minister not meet the Lord Mayor in a proper, courteous fashion and share his wonderful views on policing in the city of Dublin?</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_535">This is a case where public perceptions have very little to do with realities. The Lord Mayor and I have met on two occasions, once in St. Andrew's community centre on Pearse Street in my constituency, where I had a very pleasant conversation with him.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_537">The other occasion was that which I mentioned at the outset of the question – in my office. He was accompanied by three other members of Dublin City Council. There was not one angry word or even a cross word. It was the most cordial and happy meeting that I have ever had with four public representatives regarding criminal law issues. There was no suggestion on either side of ill feeling or anger of any kind. I am at a loss to explain why the media should think that anything that I have ever done regarding any public representative would be discourteous or in any sense arrogant or bullying. As the Deputy knows, I do not behave in that way, and never have done.</p>

          <p eId="para_555">The package of measures under negotiation with the Prison Officers' Association does not refer to any proposal for privatised prisons.

          <p eId="para_558">It is important that we know what will be the end-game in respect of this matter. We are aware that negotiations are under way. My party would be the first to agree that, compared to other sectors, the levels of overtime being paid at present are stratospheric. Everyone knows that a way out is needed, and such a way exists without resorting to privatisation. Will the Minister state whether he agrees with the director of the Irish Prison Service in respect of this matter? The latter is making many positive noises about privatisation and appears to be blissfully unaware of the failures of privatisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Will the Minister indicate what will be the end-game in terms of the conclusion of the balloting process? Is privatisation one of the options available to the Minister and has he made plans in this regard? We are aware that the State, through the Office of Public Works, has fine plans for investment in prisons and, among other things, has a strong master-plan for the redevelopment of part of the Mountjoy campus. I may be straying slightly from the content of the original question, but I want to know what will be the end-game. What does the Minister have up his sleeve in the event that the negotiations break down?</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_560">I am not in the business of playing games of any kind and, therefore, there is no beginning, middle or end-game in respect of this matter. I am deadly serious about what I am doing and game-playing, if it has happened in the past, is going to end now.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">As far as I am concerned, the Prison Service must be run economically. In that context, the Deputy referred to the "stratospheric" levels of overtime being paid. Taxpayers are being confronted with a demand that matters should continue as they are at present. The answer to such a demand is an emphatic no. The House has not provided funding which would enable me to allow matters to continue in their current vein and no such funding will be provided by the Government. We have reached the point where existing rates of overtime are not merely unsustainable, they are unpayable. In light of those circumstances, I have placed proposals before the Prison Officers' Association.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">I indicated in reply to earlier questions – I do not propose to repeat myself at inordinate length – that privatisation is not an option which would occur to me as an immediate solution to the current position in our prisons. What I want is a Prison Service that will be operated, owned, managed and staffed by the State. That is my priority and it will be achieved if people adopt a realistic approach to the manner in which the finances of the Prison Service are operated. I refuse, point blank, to allow a situation to continue where the capital budgets needed to ensure that our Prison Service will be properly developed and maintained, and will not be a model in which Victorian practices such as slopping out are the norm, are cannibalised to pay stratospheric overtime costs. These budgets must be used to create humane and proper conditions for those we want to rehabilitate and encourage to play a useful role in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I am not prepared to allow the <i>status quo</i> to remain in place. Taxpayers expect that change will occur. Since becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have clearly signalled that to all interests involved in the Prison Service. I will not be deflected from my goal, nor will I allow the smokescreen of privatisation to be raised by people to create an artificial conflict. What is at issue here is whether the State can operate a prison service with substantial resources in a sensible, rational and fair-minded way. The Government has put forward proposals which would improve not merely the financial management of the Prison Service but also the quality of life of many prison officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The sick leave issue, to which Deputy Deasy referred, and the overtime issue are related and it would be naive not to see them as such. I intend that these issues will be confronted, sooner rather than later. I have given every opportunity for the agreement process to run its course. The SORT-STEP process, which was initiated seven years ago, is over in terms of its negotiation phase. We are now at the point of decision. It falls to the Prison Officers' Association, which is balloting its members, to make the immediate decision. I cannot wait much longer before taking unilateral action if we cannot proceed on the basis of agreement.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_565">The Minister referred to a number of serious issues such as prison policy, standards, conditions in prisons, staff numbers and overtime. It seems that the matter of privatisation is not conditional on any of these. However, it is conditional on a particular industrial dispute taking place at present. The prospect of privatisation is being held over prison staff, who are balloting at present, by the Irish Prison Service. The message being put across is that if members of staff do not vote the right way, the service will be privatised. It is improper to get involved in an industrial dispute in this fashion. If there are grounds for privatisation, the Minister should put them before the House in order that they can be debated. He should present a Green Paper or a White Paper and come before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">The Minister is intervening with the threat of privatisation in respect of a narrow sectoral issue, namely, that of industrialisation, and that is totally wrong. He is not blameless in regard to this matter, particularly in terms of the possible privatisation of escort duties. It is time we considered the future of the prison system in a broader sense. Those involved with the Prison Service, be it the Minister or some other agency, should not be lightly issuing threats of this nature. We should look at prison policy in the wider sense. Will the Minister provide a categorical declaration that this will be the case, rather than it being conditional on what happens in respect of the ballot among prison staff?</p>

          <p eId="para_567">I welcome the Minister's statement that he wants the Prison Service – I hope in its entirety – to remain under the control of and to continue to be operated by the State. On 24 September a group of 16 leading experts in the fields of criminology and penology asked the Minister to publicly state his position in this regard, which he has now done. They also asked if he would follow the example of the Government of New Zealand which is introducing legislation to prevent the privatisation of prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Does the Minister agree that one of the major problems with the Prison Service is the tendency to incarcerate too many non-violent prisoners? Does he also agree that dealing with such individuals or short-sentence prisoners in the community would save the Exchequer up to €62 million per year? Does he further agree that if we addressed the problem of those who re-offend and are returned to prison, the Exchequer would make additional savings and, if it ever can be the case, prisons would be made economical? Perhaps some of the effort the Minister is investing in facing down the POA would be better spent in ensuring that our prisons are run to a proper standard and that people do not re-offend and spend more time in jail.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">I reiterate to Deputy Costello that there is no question of threatening anybody with privatisation. I have clearly and unequivocally indicated to the House what my preference in this is and I intend to follow my political judgment and stick with my preference. I want to make it equally clear that the public is entitled to have value for money, especially in the context of a State-run service.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Deputy Deasy raised the issue of sick leave. In a prison service that has one of the highest ratios of prison officers to prisoners anywhere in the world, would one imagine there would be one of the lowest overtime requirements. Curiously, we have the worst of both worlds. We have one of the highest ratios of prison officers to prisoners and the highest ratio of prison officer overtime to prisoner officer wages. That is the reality I have to confront.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked should we not be trying to avoid prison as a solution. I strongly believe that prison should be the remedy of last resort for the courts in dealing with offenders. I invite anyone in this House who wants to see what the inside of a prison is like to make arrangements through the Prison Service to visit our prisons.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">In fairness to that Deputy, I am not talking about him. Anyone who comes to this House and expostulates on the need for more and more people to go to jail for longer and longer terms should, before they talk, walk the walk – to use Deputy Deasy's phrase – down a few corridors to see what they are talking about. I agree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh that for any offender, particularly young offenders, a sentence of imprisonment is a personal catastrophe and should be avoided if at all possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked if I would not be better expending my energies on trying to create a prison service that is more rehabilitative rather that dealing with this overtime issue. It is a fair-minded question. The two issues are faces of the same coin. Overtime is cannibalising the capital budget and preventing prison officers from being deployed to rehabilitative training and interaction with prisoners. The huge expense the overtime budget constitutes, and the huge handicap it represents for our Prison Service, is retarding our capacity to modernise, improve and humanise our prison system to the maximum extent. Therefore, it is not a question of focusing on the wrong issue – the two are the same issue. If I cannot deal with the overtime issue and the haemorrhage of expenditure into that waste, I will not be in a position to deal with improving our Prison Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I agree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh that as a society we should not be in the mode of some societies which regard prison as a deterrent of first resort. It should be a remedy of last resort in the criminal justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The Deputy asked whether I would be tempted to follow the New Zealand precedent of legislating to prevent the privatisation of prisons. As I understand it, that does not arise in this jurisdiction as it would require legislation for me to hand over the management of Irish prisons to persons other than officers of the State. As a Minister, it would be <i>ultra vires</i> to attempt without statute to privatise the management of our prisons. I hasten to add that this does not extend to peripheral services such as transport. As far as I am concerned, that issue simply does not arise now. What is needed is for people to concentrate on the fundamental issue, namely, giving the taxpayer and society what they are entitled to – some fairness in relation to the costs of the prison system to the economy. I am intent on achieving that.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">I accept what the Minister has said. He stated that the possibility of a public private partnership would be considered. In any PPP, something is given by the State in return for receiving a service from the private sector. Is the Minister considering that the lands on which some of our prisons operate would be given to the private sector? What consideration does the Minister have in mind in the instance where he would consider PPPs?</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_579">We have two choices if we require new prison buildings. We can do what we attempted in the past and build them through the Office of Public Works. In the case of Wheatfield, that cost an awful lot of money and took an awful lot of time. Alternatively, we can do what any intelligent society would do if it were building a major institution. We could ask someone, on a public private partnership basis, to design, build and possibly maintain the structure of a building they had designed and built. That does not necessarily have implications for the management of the institution thereafter. For instance, it is possible to build a hospital, bridge or stretch of motorway through PPP. It does not mean it falls to the private sector to staff or manage the activities of the institution in question. PPPs are not the thin end of a wedge of privatisation of the function of governing and custodial functions of prisons. I see no logical connection between the two.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">If we have to build a new prison – that is a mater on which no conclusions, tentative or otherwise, have been arrived at – I presume nearly everyone in this House, with the possible exception of the current occupant of a certain place in Mountjoy Prison, would back me if I had the project designed, built and possibly maintained by the private sector.</p>

          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_590">Those with the greatest need in this area are those with no homes at all and the housing statistics bulletin states that there are 5,581 homeless people in the country. The reaction of groups outside the House with an interest in this area must be borne in mind during this debate. Threshold has welcomed the Bill as a major step forward for both landlords and tenants, saying it will address imbalances in the sector. However, it has pointed out that loopholes exist which could be exploited by unscrupulous landlords, who are in the minority, in order to escape their obligations under the Bill. I will return to these loopholes in a moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Fine Gael views this Bill against the need for proper recognition of rights and responsibilities. Mine is a progressive centre party and we completely reject the arguments of those who seem to jump down the throats of anyone who owns property. It is very easy to characterise all landlords as bad but that is wrong. We also reject those who believe the market is king. With the right to hold and let property comes important responsibilities – to treat tenants with the respect they deserve and to grant them their rights. Rights are provided in this Bill for the most part, which is very important. Transparency is also important, such as a contract which clearly indicates the entitlements of landlords and tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Fine Gael understands that a vibrant rental sector which is attractive as a medium-term option – not just a short-term option as is the case at present – is vital to the future of our economy. That means ensuring the rental sector is fair to landlords so that we can boost supply, as well as making it fair for tenants in order to maintain demand. Regrettably, the escalation of house prices means many people are looking at the rental market and that is why the Bill is so important. It gives people tenure and the right of renewal of tenancy up to five years. Those are important provisions because the growth of the Irish economy has meant the possibility of home ownership is beyond the remit of a huge number of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">In short, we need to root out exploitation, to give people the protection they deserve and to make the letting of property an attractive option. The Bill addresses the major issues in the sector and with some fine tuning it will stand the test of time. However, the inconsistencies in the Bill must be ironed out before it is passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The composition of the Private Residential Tenancies Board needs to be spelt out more clearly in section 147. The board is central to ensuring the spirit of the Bill is adhered to and that neither tenants nor landlords can abuse perceived loopholes in the Bill. The Minister is free to choose whoever he wants as long as he deems that they have adequate experience in the area and there is an equitable balance between men and women on the board, while the balance between landlord interests and tenant interests must also be maintained. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Deputy Allen has proposed a balance of five landlord representatives, five tenant representatives and five impartial people; it is important to have equity in this area. The Minister has significant powers regarding appointing people and section 148(2) allows him to make a very subjective decision to remove a member of the board at any time. This gives the Minister great power over the functioning of what needs to be an independent group. These groups should be seen to be independent, like the groups granting broadcasting licences. At any debates I attended involving the latter groups, it was made clear that they were independent bodies and had no responsibility to the Minister. If the Minister has the power to sack or fire—</p>

          <p eId="para_609">Section 125 of the Bill refers to the publication of the registry details. However, no information on specific identity and rent amount is to be included in published accounts.

          <p eId="para_611">Some landlords have several houses – I have heard of people owning ten to 15 houses. That is big business. Supervisory and maintenance staff have to be employed and accounts should be kept. A register should be kept of people with large amounts of property so they can be clearly identified. Deputy McCormack has referred to the low numbers of registered landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">There have been significant reductions in some aspects of our national tax take in the past ten years. Income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax have all come down but there have been significant gains in the value of rent and capital values for property investors. Many of these properties have been section 23 properties, involving a considerable offset of income against capital expenditure. There are significant advantages involved in this and people with shrewd accountants can avail of the tax loopholes which exist in this regard. The Minister wants to encourage people into dealing with housing needs but the least that those availing of the section 23 provision could do is register as landlords and indicate their property portfolios. Those can then be inspected and people looking for tenancies will know exactly what properties are available for rent in Sligo, Galway or wherever.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">It is in the national interest that the Revenue Commissioners be given access to the registry and specific details to ensure compliance with the law. There is no moral or legal case for not allowing this. If the Minister cannot see his way to accepting this amendment, he will invite the questioning of his own agenda. This is a critical aspect. It involves big business and the landlords have access to the financial institutions. If they own five houses, they can buy five more. However, the Bacon report contained a measure that addressed that practice. The Minister for Finance could ring-fence the revenue accruing from the taxation of rental income for housing development, which would benefit the Minister of State's Department. The health service will not fund itself and it is important for the less well off to see that those who are better off pay their fair share, accepting that some will already so do. It is important to close tax loopholes in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">With regard to section 17, the number and broad nature of the definitions of anti-social behaviour could lead to great ambiguity and to eviction simply because a tenant is not liked. Once a tenancy agreement has been signed, personality difficulties should be considered in terms of why a tenant should be evicted. Does someone listening to the radio constitute interference with peaceful occupation or someone smoking cause damage to a person living in a dwelling? Such behaviour is currently the subject of a major debate on anti-smoking legislation, with which I agree. Being in the licensed trade, I consider this issue has been over-hyped. Public health concerns are greater than any other consideration. Perhaps different phrasing is required to ensure reasonable justice in the implementation of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Section 16(<i>c</i>) does not specify how much notice a landlord must give to inspect the premises or the recourse for a landlord who cannot get in contact with or the agreement of the tenant to a date and time for inspection. Perhaps a tenant could be required to give a registered postal address. In that way, notice of an inspection could be sent to a tenant by registered post and the tenant would have to acknowledge receipt of the notice. Greater clarity of rights and responsibilities in this area would resolve potential disagreements. The rights and responsibilities of tenants are equally important. Tenants have rights as have landlords. The relationship between the two is a partnership. If one is to enter into a tenancy agreement for five years, account must be taken of the maintenance of the property, and it is important to have a clear agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">I welcome the Bill. It is a step forward. It offers hope to young people in that renting a home need not necessarily be fraught with worry. It may be seen as a viable medium-term alternative to home ownership, and that is the best we can hope to achieve. It is important that potential tenants would be assured that they could have security of tenure for four or five years. Given the level of house prices, such an assurance could encourage tenants in that they could build up their savings during that period. Having regard to the level of funding given by banks, if tenants entered into a tenancy arrangement for a period, that would enable them to save money. The banks offered house loans of up to 100%, but that contributed to accelerating house prices. If potential tenants could enter into an agreement with a landlord to obtain a quality home at a fair rent, it is possible to ensure that there would be a good relationship between tenants and landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">While I welcome the Bill, I note the difficulty that has been experienced by many people in acquiring their homes. There has been the question of the role of the developer. I listened to what the Taoiseach said about the affordable housing option at the weekend, and there are possibilities in that regard. Local authorities can acquire ground on which to build houses, which people can purchase for a fixed price. That scheme must be welcomed. However, there is also the issue of social housing. I am aware of a recent housing development in Sligo, which consisted of social and affordable housing. The uptake for the affordable housing was slow due to the fact that people two blocks away acquired the same type of house for no expenditure. They questioned how they could justify paying €150,000 for the same type of house. I am not saying there should be a differential in the housing design, but there should be some modification that would give a perception of difference. In this case, the whole estate was perceived to be social housing. I am not saying there is a difference in social class between the dwellers of the two types of housing, although one may encounter such a difference. In this case, 19 social houses were allotted and they were snapped up. However, in the case of the offer of ten affordable houses in the same location and the same house design, the county council had to offer them as social housing, and 40 people then sought to take them up. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <heading>Residential Tenancies Bill 2003: Second Stage (Resumed).</heading>
        <summary title="motionProposal" eId="sum_12">Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#MJNolan" eId="spk_381">
          <from>Mr. Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_620">I welcome the introduction of this Bill. It represents a major and overdue advance in tenants' rights. Most of us are familiar with the concept that our home is not only the biggest single purchase we will make in our lives but it is also the most important one, and it is no less important an expenditure for tenants. Rented property represents tenants' homes and tenants are entitled to have a sense of home. The Bill vindicates that right and brings long overdue protection to tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The Bill provides for the legislative reforms approved by the Government arising from the recommendations of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector, which reported in July 2000. The commission put forward imaginative and far-reaching proposals dealing with complex issues and involving fundamental changes to a number of long-standing aspects of the landlord and tenant law. The Bill provides a comprehensive, modern legislative framework for the private rented sector here. It introduces a number of key provisions to the rental market: a statutory private residential tenancy board with specific functions essential to the operation and development of the sector; a new dispute resolution system which is designed to be both supportive and user friendly; and a national tenancy registration system to replace the current local authority registration system which has never been effective. The report from local authorities throughout the country is that in some cases it has been an abject failure. The Bill also provides for legally specified obligations of landlords and tenants. It further provides for improved security of tenure for tenants allied with longer notice periods and the limiting of rents to market levels. That is an important feature of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">These provisions will help balance the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants whereas the system currently tends to favour landlords. This Bill gives tenants a very fair deal. The rented residential sector in Ireland is of growing importance due to the changes in our society. For example, the labour market is far more mobile now than it ever was and for many, the rented sector is a tenure of choice. This legislation will help stabilise the private rented sector. This, in turn, will lead to increased confidence in the sector and, ultimately, to a further expansion in it to help meet Ireland's increasing housing needs. It will lead to a more professional approach to the rental market, which will benefit both tenants and investors. The Bill represents only one element of Government action to promote development of the private rental sector. Tax measures relating to this sector have already been implemented through the 2001 and 2002 Finance Acts. I know that the Minister will also be exploring and progressing other possible ways of promoting the development of the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">I welcome in particular the proposed establishment of a statutory private residential tenancy board which will be charged with a number of key functions. It will operate a national registration system for tenancies, which is a critically important function. The existing local authority registration system has not worked. However, it is essential that we know what tenancies are in existence. The commission on the private rental residential sector noted the dearth of information available on the sector. Without such basic information as the number and nature of tenancies, it is difficult to develop informed mechanisms for its development and expansion. Such basic information is standard in almost every other area of business activity and should also be standard in the rental sector. In this regard, there has been a certain reluctance on the part of landlords, particularly in the past, to register for which there are a number of reasons. I hope the Bill will tackle that reluctance.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The proposed national registration system must be complied with by landlords. In the past they have mounted legal challenges to registration. I now urge them to comply with the law and I urge the board to take any necessary steps, including legal procedures, to ensure that tenancies are registered.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">The registration process will help the board to undertake much-needed research into the sector and provide other information and policy advice to the Minister. I am glad to note that the Minister is considering enabling the board to monitor the operation of this legislation and to make recommendations for any amendments that may be required for its efficient and effective implementation. This process can be monitored as time goes by and the work of the board is reviewed by the Department and the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">I suspect the board will become primarily known for its dispute resolution services. This is a particularly innovative development, which will be welcomed by landlords and tenants alike. Currently, if a landlord and tenant are in dispute, their only legal recourse is through the courts. Taking court action is very expensive and it can take months for a case to be heard. Inevitably, especially because of the costs involved, many parties do not pursue legal action and thus fail to have their rights upheld and their problems addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">Under the new process, the parties will have a reasonably inexpensive, speedy and efficient alternative available. As I understand it, what is proposed is a two-stage process involving a choice of either mediation or adjudication followed by a tribunal investigation which, if the dispute remains unresolved, can then proceed to court. The procedures will be very user-friendly and in most cases should remove the need for costly professional representation. This must be welcomed by all sides in this area of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The importance of mediation cannot be overstated. The board's mediation service, which is already up and running, gives the parties in dispute the opportunity to resolve their problems together, with assistance from the board. This facilitates them to reach their own solution to whatever problems they may have. It will in many cases allow the relationship between landlord and tenant to continue, and may even strengthen it. The process is designed to be supportive, whereas the current court procedures are of their nature confrontational and almost guaranteed to sever an ongoing relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Any measure which helps the parties to find their own solution rather than have one imposed on them is beneficial and will result in happier outcomes for all involved. The process will be confidential. This will perhaps be of particular importance in some smaller communities. It will enable the parties to conclude their business in private and without fear that others will be privy to their affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The dispute resolution aspect of this Bill is of major importance to everyone in the residential tenancy business. The dispute resolution process outlines procedures for the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants. The principal function being assigned to the private residential tenancies board to be established under the Bill is the resolution of all disputes arising between landlords and tenants of dwellings to which the Bill applies. This means that for these tenancies, the board's dispute resolution function will replace the current role of the courts in such matters. All Members are no doubt aware of disputes and difficult situations where tenants involved in disputes with landlords find that due to a lack of means, they are unable to get resolution to their difficulties. The manner in which some landlords treat their tenants is often referred to as employing a big stick. Moreover, some tenants do not play their part in taking care of houses and apartments.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">The dispute resolution procedures to be followed have been refined and developed by the <i>ad hoc</i> private residential tenancy board, established some time ago by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, from those procedures described in the report of the commission on the private rental sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The process will consist of two stages. The first is either mediation or adjudication, which will be confidential. The second stage is a public hearing by a tenancy tribunal comprised of three persons drawn from the board's dispute resolution committee. The tribunal will operate like a court but in a more informal manner, and the more informal, the better. With too much formality, one finds people taking up difficult positions and matters can become increasingly difficult to resolve.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">A mediated agreement or determination order of an adjudicator or the tribunal will result in a determination order of the board which will be binding on all sides. The determination order resulting from the tribunal may be appealed in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. This can be appealed to the High Court but only on a point of law. The enforcement of any orders not complied with will be done through the Circuit Court in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">I welcome this Bill as it is a step in the right direction. The one disappointing aspect is the length of time it has taken to come before the House. I commend the Minister for bringing it this far and I hope it will have a speedy passage through both Houses. The Bill will bring fairness, certainty and professionalism to the rented sector. Its provisions are balanced and will provide benefits to both landlords and tenants.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_382">
          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_635">I wish to share my time with Deputy Lynch.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">The Labour Party supports this Bill. It has arrived into the House at a very leisurely pace, which is hardly appropriate considering the issues it sets out to address. It is certainly not a Bill which will meet all the needs of tenants, but welcome progress is being made. When one considers that according to the latest estimate of Threshold, 150,000 tenancies currently exist in the private rented sector, that indicates that we are talking about a sizeable population. In total we are probably talking about 400,000 or 500,000 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Ireland is unique in the European Union in terms of our high level of home ownership. However, partly because of demographics, a fairly sizeable number of people still live in the private rented sector. Very often they live in situations which make them vulnerable and their rights, as compared with those of people in other EU countries, are underdeveloped. Many of us have experienced an increase in the number of non-nationals attending our clinics. We learn a great deal about ourselves from these people. EU nationals, in particular, are struck by the inadequacy of protection for people living here in private rented accommodation. They are critical of our system in that regard. This Bill is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I recall a very sad case in my constituency which received a great deal of media attention in the last few months. A 70 year old man and his wife were in court fighting an eviction order from their landlord, Lord Meath, a fairly extensive property owner in his own right. He was not a man struggling to meet his bills. He sought an eviction order against the elderly man who had lived in the modest house since he was three years old. Fortunately, the tenant won the case. He was protected by a technicality in a caretaker's agreement which his father held rather than by the strength of his position as a tenant. Even though we live in a modern world where the idea of people having rights and the principle of equality are spoken about a great deal, people can remain tied to archaic and grossly unfair relationships with powerful landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">I was shocked to learn, during my time as Minister of State with responsibility for the environment and local government, that landlords tended to be resisters rather than promoters of change and progress. I was surprised that unlike other vested interests in this country, they had not recognised the need to have a good, professional body representing their interests. They tended to be highly secretive in their approach. The IPOA became more public in those days, in particular, in resisting the very modest registration introduced and initiated by my colleague, Deputy Stagg, during his time as Minister of State with responsibility for housing. It strenuously resisted that change. Currently, one in five landlords are properly registered with the local authority. That is not a good record nor is it one in which landlords should take pride. It is a pretty shameful record. Despite the commission's good work in trying to deal with irreconcilable forces within the private rented sector, we now have resistance from that same source in the IPOA. It is attacking the provisions for registration as being a bureaucratic nightmare. It is trying to ensure it is protected against what, again, are reasonable registration proposals which should not be resisted by anybody of a reasonable frame of mind. Perhaps that says a great deal about the workings of that organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">I have some concerns regarding exempted tenants, in particular the exempted tenant renting accommodation in property with part commercial use. Something which has concentrated the minds of a number of Ministers, including myself, was how best to use the space above commercial premises for residential purposes. The idea of living above a shop is one which deserves to be promoted and has been promoted in very generous ways. There is a general lack of use of space in commercial premises at first, second or even third floor level. That means many premises in our towns and cities are underused in terms of their capacity to house people in good quality accommodation, close to services and using existing infrastructure, all the things which provide for sustainable development. It is not helpful or appropriate if such tenants lose out as a result of their being tenants of a mixed use building. That does not help to promote the idea of living above the shop. We should ensure that people living above commercial premises are secured to an ever greater degree because it is an important environmental move that needs to be encouraged.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I note social housing tenants are not covered by this legislation and one can understand why. It is important to take this opportunity to note that very often tenants living in social housing suffer greatly at the hands of their landlords. I know of many people living in council houses that have no central heating, where windows and doors are falling out, where they are subject to the most gross anti-social behaviour and where people are dumping next to them. However, the response from the local authorities is non-existent or ineffective.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The Minister of State with responsibility for housing when on this side of the House would assiduously seek improvements for tenants in his constituency and rightly so. I commend him for that. Unfortunately, the same people often live in grossly inadequate council properties in terms of today's needs. In particular, young families are living in houses with no central heating with all the attendant problems such as dampness and so on. The Minister of State is as aware as I am of these problems and people's needs. They are the ones who are losing out at a time when we have, as Deputy O'Keeffe pointed out, the most right-wing Government in the history of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I know the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is not a right-wing Minister. I call on him to examine the rights of tenants who are dependant on councils to take care of their property. Those councils very often fail to do so. On the terms of reasons for termination of tenancies, I agree with Deputy Gilmore who argued for a more flexible tenancy or more open-ended tenancy. The Bill provides a four-year timeframe. The exemptions are very wide. I had difficulty thinking of reasons to terminate a tenancy other than those exempt from the four-year tenancy agreement. While I have a great deal more to say, I will give way to my colleague, Deputy Lynch.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_644">There are extremely good landlords in this country. There are kind people who offer their property for rent and there are those who take on tenants as virtual family members. However, they are few and far between.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The main gripe people have about rented property is the lack of security. I do not believe I am the only public representative in the Dáil to be contacted by people in this regard, not only on a daily but on virtually an hourly basis. They fear, usually following a period in which they have received threatening letters, that they will be given only two weeks notice before they will be thrown on to the streets. They feel they have no security, that their home is not their own and that once they live in private rented accommodation they cannot put down roots in an area.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">Tenants with children, usually very young children, often find themselves in this position. Their situation then becomes ten times worse. It is difficult enough for single people to try to find alternative accommodation, but it is virtually impossible if there are young children involved, especially where the rent allowance has been capped and where to work would mean complete forfeiture of the allowance. To hold a job would mean having to pay the full rent, which could not be afforded, plus child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">In view of this the Bill is welcome. It has been a long time in preparation, which is not the fault of any one Administration. I am aware of the resistance it has met. While it has a number of flaws, it will provide the kind of security people seek.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">However, the Bill will not address the problem of bad accommodation. In 2002, there were 5,059 inspections of private rented dwellings. This must be seen in the context of what can be conservatively estimated as 150,000 tenancies in the private rented sector. More than half of those inspected failed to meet minimum standards. By this is usually meant the availability of hot and cold water, the avoidance of dampness making it unfit for human habitation and the lack of rodent infestation, rotting floor boards or roof leakages. Of those inspections that failed, only 17 cases were taken to court, of which 15 were in Dublin. This means that outside Dublin only two prosecutions were taken, which is of significance to non-Dublin Deputies, such as myself. It is an appalling statistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">At present, Cork City Council has 3,065 applications for housing on its books while 1,200 are waiting approval. Some 80% of these are in private rented accommodation, which according to my discussions with officials is a conservative estimate, of which it may be taken that 10% are living in reasonable accommodation. It is striking to come across people living in good accommodation. Last year, one in four callers to Threshold's advice centre had a gross annual income of less than €15,000. This forces them into the type of low grade accommodation of which we are all aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Social welfare recipients must deal with the cap on rent allowances. This means the only type of accommodation available to them is at the lower end of the range. We have all seen the threatening letters and are aware of landlords who, without an appointment or hindrance, access such accommodation with their own key to undertake an inspection. We are all aware of flats with faulty and dangerous electrical wiring, where the water has been turned off for no apparent reason and where children are continuously suffering from coughs, colds, pneumonia and chest infections, going on to develop asthma and bronchitis due to unhealthy living conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The Bill will offer people a degree of protection, but it does nothing to rid us of the awful accommodation in which those on very low incomes are forced to live. I am sure Deputy Gilmore will move amendments on Committee Stage. It must be ensured that landlords do not delay in providing tenants with tenancy agreements, thereby extending the period over which they control the tenancy and depriving the tenant of security. The Bill must also be amended to ensure that landlords who deliberately set out to obstruct the rights of tenants will be subject to penalties.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">It is likely that tenants of six months standing or longer, who have passed the requisite probationary period, will seek the security the Bill will provide. They will seek a tenancy agreement, at which point they may be seen as trouble-makers for asserting their rights. They may then be served with a week's notice to quit. The legislation must ensure that this kind of situation cannot be allowed to arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The Bill is welcome, even if it is long overdue. It is about time it was introduced. Despite the appalling conditions in which some tenants must live, it will at least offer them a degree of security. However, there is no timeframe for its implementation. When it is passed into law, it will be at the discretion of the Minister to make regulations to bring its provisions into operation. This could cause difficulties and I see no reason its provisions should not take immediate effect following passage of the Bill into law.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_384">
          <from>Mr. Kelleher</from>
          <p eId="para_654">I welcome the opportunity to debate the issues surrounding private residential tenancies. It is topical on a number of fronts, especially the escalating house prices and expensive rental market. While huge advances have been made with regard to the increase in the number of houses under construction, young people who are not on the capital ladder continue to encounter difficulties when purchasing their first home. That issue must also be addressed and it must be ensured that landlords and tenants have rights. The legislation addresses both sides of the argument and provides a compromise.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">I recall during history classes in school learning about the Land League and the three Fs – free sale, fair rent and fixity of tenure. The Bill addresses security of tenure. Rents have increased significantly in recent times and Members will be aware of many evictions, particularly in urban areas, because tenants had no rights and landlords sought people who were capable of paying higher rents. While that may be considered to be part of a fair and open market, it was unfair to long-term tenants who kept their accommodation in reasonable nick. They were evicted because of increased rents, which resulted from an increase in our population through immigration and the return of many emigrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">However, we must be broad minded and adventurous in addressing the underlying problems. House prices are escalating at a pace that will create major problems down the road. My friends are finding it exceedingly difficult not only to secure rented accommodation but also to meet the rents being sought, which only a few years ago were the equivalent of a mortgage repayment. While that pressure remains on the housing market, it must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Threshold has welcomed the Bill's provisions while the Irish Property Owners Association has not. Under the chairmanship of Tom Dunne, the commission brought forward sensible proposals and I compliment the Government on implementing its recommendations in legislative form.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">Local authorities are among the worst landlords in Ireland. They renege on their basic responsibilities to ensure anti-social behaviour is eradicated on their properties and the curtilages of properties are maintained in a reasonable condition. People dump rubbish outside their houses, for instance, on many local authority housing estates and local authorities make no effort to ensure this activity ceases. This issue must be addressed. The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 contains provisions to address anti-social behaviour but many local authorities are shirking their responsibilities and washing their hands of the problem by pointing out they are suffering from a lack of resources. It does not take much to deal with people who engage in anti-social behaviour on local authority estates and who do not maintain their properties in a reasonable condition. Every person who is physically capable should be obliged to maintain their property. Once the standard of local authority housing estates falls, it has a knock-on effect and communities are demoralised across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I refer to stage payments, which is a serious issue in Cork. When a person is purchasing a house, he or she puts down a booking deposit and pays the balance on signing the contract. This is followed by a payment when the ground work is completed and another payment when joist level is reached. Finally, when the snag list is completed, the person draws down the mortgage.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_385">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_660">I am pleased, in the unavoidable absence of the Taoiseach, to have the opportunity to open what is a timely and important debate. At the conclusion of the Convention we undertook to make time available for this purpose. The Intergovernmental Conference began in Rome on 1 October and we are, therefore, at an early stage in proceedings. The Government is committed to keeping the House, the relevant Oireachtas committees and the public fully informed of developments. Following the Intergovernmental Conference and European Council meeting this week, the Taoiseach will report to the Dáil on the outcome. In addition, the National Forum on Europe will hold a plenary session on 23 October on the outcome of the Convention which he will address.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Over the past two years there has been a major improvement in the intensity and quality of our national debate on Europe, inside and outside the House. I congratulate Deputy Gay Mitchell and his colleagues on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs. They are vigorously using the new scrutiny procedures to examine the Government's approach to issues on the European agenda. I also pay tribute to the outstanding work of the forum. The forum has already produced a valuable account of the Convention text. The short explanatory guide that my own Department has circulated to all Members is also intended to serve as a reference point. It is intended to be clear and succinct, though not fully comprehensive, and I hope it is useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">The more thoroughly we discuss issues nationally, the better prepared we are to take part in debate at Union level. However, the greatest challenge we face is to widen the discussion beyond that initiated to ensure the public understand and support what is happening in its name. The Taoiseach made the point at Rome that the Intergovernmental Conference as a whole needed a proper communications strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">This time last year we were on the eve of the second Nice referendum. A highly positive aspect of the process was that it kindled a national debate about Europe. The people broadly endorsed not only the Nice treaty and enlargement in the referendum but also Ireland's place in the Union 30 years on. The verdict was the Union has been instrumental in creating a peaceful and prosperous Europe, which has been good for Ireland and in which Ireland has played its own distinctive part.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">The Union has expanded and changed immensely in the 30 years since Ireland joined. Ireland has also changed and developed, in some ways almost out of all recognition, but the fundamental points remain. Europe remains vital to our prosperity as a small, outward looking economy. It has encouraged the modernisation of our society and its values of tolerance and respect for human rights and the rule of law are our values. They are relevant both in Europe and throughout the world. The Irish people are not naive or starry eyed about Europe as they recognise its shortcomings but they have a basic sense of its enduring promise and of its practical benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">That is the context in which the proposed constitutional treaty should be analysed. It is highly significant but, as is inevitable in a negotiation, it is possible to get too close to the detail. Standing back, the Convention draft does not fundamentally alter the nature of the Union as a unique experiment in the voluntary sharing of sovereignty by independent states. It does not fundamentally alter the Union's powers or its relationship with member states, the mix of policies that has worked so effectively for Ireland or the balances between the institutions and among member states. If the people support the Union and our membership of it – and I am sure they do – then they can be broadly happy with the Convention outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The Convention itself was an innovative approach to treaty change. A body representative of the peoples, states and institutions of Europe was established rather than having the preparatory work carried out by anonymous officials behind closed doors. All the member and applicant states were represented at both Government and parliamentary level and the European Parliament and the Commission were also present. All had their say. Thousands of pages of draft texts and amendments were considered and finally a single text was produced. It is right that the Convention approach has won widespread approval. I am pleased that the draft constitutional treaty recommends that it continue to be used in the future. I do not believe there can be a return to the old ways. The Intergovernmental Conference has its own role to play. It cannot be a rubber stamp, but the great bulk of the Convention's work should stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Ireland's team at the Convention has been thanked for its work by the Taoiseach in the House. It is fair to say that Ireland was most ably represented and our representatives from the Government and Opposition benches made a positive contribution to the debate in the European Convention and to the Convention's outcome. The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, preceded by Ray MacSharry and Bobby McDonagh for the Government, as well as Deputies John Bruton, Carey and Gormley and Proinsias De Rossa MEP, were active and positive. This positive engagement enabled Ireland to bring to the table its values and interests and to have them reflected in the text.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The Convention allowed a broad consensus to emerge on a range of hitherto difficult issues. The consensus covered the legal personality of the Union, a simplified and comprehensible legislative framework, a clear delineation of the roles of the union and member states, the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the draft constitutional treaty without expanding the EU's area of competence and the consolidation of the existing treaties in a coherent and comprehensible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">It will be possible for the first time for the concerned citizen to see in one place – the opening parts of the draft – a clear description of the Union's values, objectives, powers and institutions. This is an important and welcome step forward. Article 2 of the draft treaty, for example, states that the European Union is founded on human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. Article 3 confirms that the EU's aim is to promote peace, freedom, justice, sustainable development and full employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I am also pleased the Convention has taken a serious look at the important position that national Parliaments occupy in the democratic life of the Union. A range of measures has been proposed to enhance the role they play. The most significant of these measures involves oversight of the principle of subsidiarity – ensuring that things are done at the most appropriate level and only at Union level when that is the best approach. The Convention recommendations would enhance our own national scrutiny arrangements. When the Commission is thinking of bringing forward proposals in future, it will do so in the knowledge that it will be open to national Parliaments to challenge the proposals for failing to respect subsidiarity. If one third of Parliaments challenge them, they will have to be reconsidered. I hope the brake will not have to be applied too frequently, but its existence should help to ensure that proper thought is given before proposals are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">At our meeting in Rome on 1 October to open the Intergovernmental Conference, the Heads of State or Government of the member and observer countries, including the Taoiseach, set out their broad negotiating stances. The Taoiseach made clear that Ireland will respect the outcome of the Convention as a good basis for our work. We do not wish to see all the work unravelled, but we have a number of key concerns. These include decision making in taxation matters and in the justice and home affairs area. There will be ongoing political discussion regarding the institutions before we reach a final agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Ireland supports the further extension of qualified majority voting, in general, as well as co-decision by the European Parliament. As the Union becomes larger, the risk of deadlock becomes correspondingly great. We have already benefited from efficient QMV decision making in areas such as the internal market and agriculture. Similarly, the greater involvement of MEPs as directly elected public representatives is also appropriate. It is well known, however, that we believe unanimity should remain in a very small number of areas. One of these is taxation, which is particularly central to the relationship between citizens and their own Governments. I am glad the Convention draft retains the need for unanimous decisions in nearly all areas of taxation. The Government will continue to oppose any departure from this principle and it will want to see a watertight final text.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The Convention has made important advances in recommending enhanced European action against serious cross-border crime. Deputy John Bruton, as chairman of the relevant working group, played a major part in this regard. It is important, however, that the new arrangements do not affect the deeply rooted traditions and practices of member states or the constitutional rights of their people. We will seek to ensure that this is guaranteed.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">Security and defence policy is another priority area. The Government would like the European Union to play a greater role for good on the international stage in a way that respects the values of member states. We can welcome many aspects of the Convention proposals. The appointment of a Union Minister for foreign affairs will bring greater coherence and visibility to the EU's external action. The objectives that will shape the EU's external action include, at our suggestion, support for human rights, conflict prevention, sustainable development and the UN Charter. The EU is making an increasing contribution in support of international peace and security. It has undertaken missions this year under the ESDP in the western Balkans and central Africa. Kofi Annan has acknowledged that this growing capability for conflict prevention and crisis management is fully consistent with support for the United Nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The Convention made a number of proposals in the security and defence area. Ireland's view is that the proposals, particularly those in respect of structured co-operation and common defence, require further consideration by the Intergovernmental Conference. The Government's approach is that new arrangements in this area should be inclusive and accountable to all member states. It is clear, however, that we will retain our right to make our own decisions on whether to participate in EU crisis management operations. I have made clear to the House that this will involve Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation. The proposals drawn up by the Convention do not change the present situation as regards common defence. Our position is clear – while we will not stand in the way of others, Ireland could only participate in an EU common defence with the prior consent of the people in a referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">We are working at the Intergovernmental Conference to ensure that these core concerns are reflected in the final text of the constitutional treaty. We think that improvements can be made in respect of a range of other issues without radically changing the draft. We will take the opportunities that will arise to support such improvements without losing sight of the overall balance and coherence of the text. For example, ECOFIN Ministers, including the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, have been developing a consensus on changes to certain economic and budgetary articles. The Government will support a reference to God or Europe's Christian heritage in the preamble of the constitutional treaty, should an agreed wording be possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">A great deal of time will be devoted to institutional issues at the Intergovernmental Conference. The Government's view is that the overall balance achieved on institutional issues at the end of the Convention was a reasonable one. The text was greatly improved from the earliest drafts. It is an important priority that the individual interests of member states, particularly smaller member states, are protected. It is true that the current arrangements in terms of the Commission and the Council have suited us, but it is equally legitimate to question whether a system originally designed for an economic community of six is fully adequate for a much wider Union of 25 or more. It makes no sense to be dogmatic or confrontational in relation to these matters. The different and valid perspectives need to be reconciled.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Media coverage has tended to present the issues as being a question of big member states against smaller member states. I do not deny that the small countries tend to have certain interests and objectives in common in relation to the institutions – this is also true of the large countries – but the reality is that the great majority of issues do not break down in this way. There are significant differences among the smaller countries, as there are among the large. Some smaller countries were among the early advocates of a long-term President of the European Council, for example. We did not seek the creation of this post, but we now think it is defined in a way that protects the interests of the Commission and will ensure that its holder is more chairman than chief. We hope the post will, as its supporters argue, bring more coherence and a longer-term perspective to the work of the European Council. Similarly, a small number of member states believe that a restricted Commission is more likely to be collegiate and effective than one in which every member state is represented. The countervailing and increasingly supported argument – that a Commission drawn from the widest possible range of member states is more likely to be aware of and responsive to concerns on the ground and thus more legitimate – is also very strong.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The essence of the Convention compromise, that all member states should be represented at all times, but with a smaller number of voting Commissioners appointed on the basis of strictly equal rotation, is broadly acceptable to us as it builds on what was agreed at Nice. Aspects of the arrangement need to be teased out, however. For example, what would be the precise roles of the voting and non-voting Commissioners? On the other hand, many countries are arguing strongly for one voting Commissioner per member state. If this can be achieved on terms which protect the genuine equality of all Commissioners and all member states, as was agreed at Nice, we would very much welcome it. At the end of this process, we want an effective Commission which embraces genuine equality and serves and reflects the interests of all member states, big and small.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The question of how a qualified majority is defined is shaping up to be crucial at the Intergovernmental Conference. We recognise that the proposed new dual majority system would be simpler to understand and more efficient in terms of decision making. We would be quite happy to stick with the more complex Nice formula, but are prepared to accept the Convention's proposal. Our influence will always depend more on our capacity to network and on the effectiveness of our arguments than on any arithmetical formula. In practice, votes are rare.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Our overall approach, therefore, is pragmatic and reasonable. We do not want the Convention text to be dismantled, nor is it holy writ. Improvements and clarifications are possible. If alternative wordings attract more support that can be welcomed, but what is most needed is a sense of proportion. Each of us needs to rise from the table having secured key national interests but must also recall that the common European interest is also significant. We have a shared stake, not just in a successful outcome but in an outcome achieved in the right spirit. We do not need prolonged stand-offs and unnecessary acrimony. To date, the mood of the Intergovernmental Conference has been positive in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">The discussion in the Intergovernmental Conference will be intense and concentrated over the next two months. It is the ambition of the Italian Presidency to complete the Intergovernmental Conference in December. We fully support Italy in this. We believe that if the Intergovernmental Conference focuses on the main concerns of the member states, the negotiations can be completed within the proposed timeframe. If, however, the conference runs into our Presidency, we are fully prepared to take on the task.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Each participant must be able to see its concerns reflected in the outcome. This will be important for the member states when they come to ratify the constitutional treaty that is likely to emerge. A significant number of states have indicated that they may hold referendums. Whatever the system of ratification, it is important that the constitutional treaty that emerges serves to unite the member states and the citizens across the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">What matters most is that the final outcome is a constitutional treaty which equips the Union to be as successful and effective in the future as it has been for almost 50 years. We are on the right track. We are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference in the same way that we approach all our interaction with the European Union – positively and with a view to finding solutions. Our past experience will inform our future practice.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GayMitchell" eId="spk_386">
          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_685">I thank the Minister for his kind comments about me and the Joint Committee on European Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">What marks the Intergovernmental Conference process, the Convention on the constitutional treaty and the Intergovernmental Conference itself, is that at every opportunity a real effort has been made to inform both Houses of Parliament, through the Joint Committee on European Affairs, and the public, through the forum on Europe and the public meetings organised by the Joint Committee on European Affairs. The Government and Oireachtas representatives on the Convention appeared at several meetings of the European affairs committee to discuss what had occurred and what was coming up. Those meetings often took place on Fridays when delegations had only arrived back in Ireland and Members of the Oireachtas, who are traditionally in their constituencies, made the effort to attend.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Today's debate is part of that process and is very welcome. No one who is serious about ensuring ongoing peace and stability in Europe and that we never return to the type of instability which gave rise to the deaths of 60 million Europeans in the first half of the last century will make false claims about informing the public about this process. I do not know what more one could do, other than have a permanent television station covering proceedings, to convey the message to the public. Despite public meetings of the forum and the committee and the various meetings the Joint Committee on European Affairs has had with the Minister, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and our Oireachtas and Government deputations to the Convention, it has been difficult to get media coverage of the issues. There is no point in complaining about the media. Journalists have difficulty getting space for this sort of issue as it does not sell newspapers. However, we must apply our minds to ensuring, when the time comes to ratify, that people are aware that the concerns expressed during the first Nice treaty referendum have been addressed and that a real effort is being made to close the democratic deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">From Ireland's perspective and from the perspective of those who respect constitutions and constitution-making, the institutional questions are of primary concern, particularly proposals for a constitutional treaty for the European Union. Bunreacht na hÉireann separates the powers of various arms of State. The President, the Taoiseach and Government and the courts have certain powers and the Houses of the Oireachtas, specifically Dáil Éireann, have wide powers. The distribution of power ensures that democracy functions, that there is accountability, that the rules are clear and that there is a clear separation of institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Much of what has been written and spoken of in Ireland relates to whether Ireland should keep its EU Commissioner. I hope each State keeps a full Commissioner but if not, the Nice proposals, as modified by the draft constitutional treaty, seem to be fair. In all of the institutions of the European Union, the role of the Commission is of vital importance. The Commissioners are honest brokers acting on behalf of the member states. If the Commission is either unfairly constructed or overshadowed by another institution, the institutional balance will have changed outside of a constitutional framework and to the detriment of the Union as a whole, of its member states and, in particular, of smaller member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">For this reason I am concerned about the proposal to appoint a chairman of the European Council. The appointment of a chairman may well mean that the work of the Council is more effective. The European Council itself will become an institution under the current proposals and will have a chairman for a fixed period of two and a half years, renewable once. If the chairman were a powerful figure like Giscard d'Estaing or Baroness Thatcher, he or she could easily overshadow the President of the Commission and the Commission itself. If, as now seems open, the President of the Commission is allowed also to be chairman of the European Council, this could allow for a breakdown in the separation of powers and could, in effect, bypass those separate institutions which are intended as the institutional arrangements of the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">The European Council is a product of national parliaments. It is made up of Heads of Government and State. Therefore, it seems appropriate that a provision should be included in the terms of reference of the chairman of the European Council that he or she must resign if, say, one third of national parliaments pass a vote of no confidence in him or her. The removal of the chairman of the European Council should not be left to the European Council itself, except for incompetence or malpractice, for example. National parliaments should have a role in this. This does not require re-negotiation of the draft constitutional treaty. It could be provided for in the chairman's terms of reference. I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister to consider this matter and to raise this issue. I am anxious that we would have a mechanism whereby the national parliaments could intervene where the separation of powers within the institutions of the Union are being fudged or used to the detriment of member states by a powerful chairman of the European Council who might ignore demarcation. The separation of powers in the roles of the institutions is vital if the Union is to operate transparently, democratically and in the interests of all member states, especially smaller member states. We have a very small representation in the Parliament, now to be reduced. We have one Minister at the Council of Ministers, where there is rarely a vote. That is certainly very helpful, but if it comes to a vote we have a small number of votes.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">The role of the Commission remains important and anything that would overshadow it would be of concern to member states. The Parliaments of member states should be empowered to intervene if this should ever happen. It would be a clear warning to any permanent head of the European Council not to blur the lines of difference between the institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The protocol on defence has yet to be written. I am grateful to the Department of Foreign Affairs, which sent us today the short explanatory guide to the Draft Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe. It alludes to the new subsection 9º of Article 29.4 of the Constitution, as inserted after the referendum on the Nice treaty: "The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 1.2 of the Treaty [the Treaty of Nice] referred to in subsection 7º of this section where that common defence would include the State."  It then states that Ireland cannot enter into an EU common defence arrangement without the consent of the people in a referendum. This should be the case. I have no difficulty with it and those who made allegations on this matter prior to the last election should now admit that they should not have done so, that we are not part of a common defence arrangement and that we cannot be without a referendum, as the Minister stated.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I am grateful to the National Forum on Europe for circulating a summary of the draft constitutional treaty, in which it provides a glossary of terms. Under the heading "Protocol" it states:</p>
          <p eId="para_695">A protocol is a legal text, which is usually added (annexed) to a treaty and which deals in a more detailed way with a certain topic e.g. in the draft Constitutional Treaty there is a protocol on subsidiarity and the role of national parliaments. A protocol to a treaty has the same legal status as the treaty itself when it has been ratified by the Member States.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The phrase "when it has been ratified by the Member States" is important. Because the protocol on defence has yet to be written, an opportunity presents itself to Ireland to have an input into the content of that protocol and to have it drafted in such a way as to meet our concerns for the future defence of Europe and Ireland's role therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">I have long since argued that not only should we be part of the security and defence architecture of Europe but that we should be one of the architects. If we do not participate in making rules to meet our concerns and our vision for the future of Europe, they will be made by others. As is the case with EMU, states joining later will join according to the rules made by others. Therefore, it is time to bring an end to Ireland's so-called neutrality. Ireland should be part of an EU defence community.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">Central to our concerns is what is known as the Article 5 provision of the Western European Union treaty. This provides that if any member state is attacked, other member states that have signed up to the treaty will automatically come to its defence. This automaticity would remove from the Dáil its current constitutional right in the area of defence and security to approve such action if it were to be accepted. However, if an Article 5-type commitment could be included as a protocol – not a full treaty provision but a protocol drawn such that it would apply to some member states in one way and to others in a different way – we could arrange that the member states that wish to sign up to the principle of automaticity from the beginning could do so and that those that do not wish to sign up to it, such as Ireland, could do so by agreeing to the protocol on a case-by-case basis. If other member states want to make it automatic, let them do so. However, there should be an opportunity for the neutral and non-aligned states to build into the protocol a respect for their traditional positions and a mechanism whereby they could agree to it on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">If a member state were attacked, the Dáil would probably approve going to its assistance. The protocol would not make a huge difference. If we keep our heads down while others are making the rules, we will not influence those rules. The protocol will simply be drawn up as a full treaty provision with no exceptions. A country will have to be part of it or not. If at some future date – we live in a very dangerous and changing world – we wanted to join, we would have to do so according to the rules made by others. It may serve us as politicians to make claims about these rules or to accuse the Government or Fine Gael of having a particular agenda – it will not be the politicians' children that will be in the front line. It will be argued that a front line will come about very quickly. However, the difference between politician and statesman lies in recognising the reality that we have a golden opportunity to have a protocol shaped in the way Ireland envisages the future of Europe and its role therein. Some will ask who would attack us. Who would attack any member state? Why do we not argue that all member states give up their defence arrangements?</p>

          <p eId="para_703">Have we learned nothing from history? Member states have a right to have defence forces to ensure that some of those who would usurp this and other states would be stood up to and faced down. We may have to do this within the State and may have to do so in Europe. The rules are being made now and the Minister should not listen to the protesters who constantly put their own interests before those of the people. The rules are in the process of being made for half a century perhaps. If we sign up to a common defence arrangement later, let us not do so according to the rules made by others. Let us make the rules now to suit what we consider to be our best interests and the interests of Europe. If we thought about this we could secure a provision in the protocol on defence that would allow those who want to sign up to automaticity to do so and those who want to join on a case-by-case basis to do so, such as the four neutral and non-aligned states.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">There is a case to be made for making some reference to God in the European constitution. I was very taken aback at a European Forum meeting I addressed in Stillorgan when a lay Presbyterian leader – the same man who bent over backwards to facilitate the secularists – was almost mocked when he suggested that there might be some reference to God. I ask the so-called liberals who almost mocked him if it is not the mark of a true liberal that he or she respect the rights and beliefs of others. It would surely not offend anybody if proper wording could be found to make reference to almighty God in a way that meets the concerns of persons with religious beliefs without offending others. Is that not what unity in diversity is all about? Will the Minister ensure that the role of national Parliament, through the Committee on European Affairs in particular, continues to evolve. I thank him, the Minister of State and their staff for their assistance to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Next year we will host COSAC, the Conference of the Community and European Affairs Committees of Parliaments of the EU. The European Parliament will send two vice presidents and Mr. Brok, who is Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Parliament. Other member states send former Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers to COSAC meetings. I hope the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will make themselves available for the opening of the conference and we will be in touch with them about this in due course. I have been to Athens and Rome and noted that the Heads of State and Foreign Ministers have always made themselves available.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_707">When this debate reaches the public, I hope it will not be a very arid confrontation between theists and secularists and that people will not put themselves into paroxysms of reaction regarding impending invasion of this country or the European Union. The issues are more serious. It is very interesting that the draft constitution, at the very beginning, contains a reference in Greek to Thucydides. In his work on the nature of Europe, Thucydides took a much more reflective view than the one we just heard from Deputy Gay Mitchell. To be compared to Thucydides is a great compliment, even on a Wednesday afternoon. He would be offended by the view of Europe as some kind of bus on which one leaps as it leaves the station or a club suffering from severe anxiety about its rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">What has emerged from the Convention process for discussion extends beyond a project. With the greatest respect to Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, the text, even in terms of initiating a debate, has certain difficulties in that it is described as a constitutional treaty. The terms "constitutional" and "treaty" do not sit easily together. The nature of constitutions is their certainty. According to Giovanni Sartori, perhaps the most distinguished writer on the nature of constitutions, even when they are old, constitutions steer the way. The principle of constitutional <i>garantisme</i>– what a constitution guarantees – is perhaps most important. Given that a treaty comes either in the middle or at the end of a process, the two terms almost contradict each other, which is not just an academic point.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">I pay tribute to those who have patiently stuck with the project of Europe. As its chairman, Deputy Gay Mitchell has sought to expand the competence of the Joint Committee on European Affairs with only minimal resources at his disposal – the committee needs more resources. Attempts have also been made to involve the Forum on the Future of Europe and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">I sense an enormous gap between the Europe which may be coming about at a conceptual level and the people's impression of it. I say this as a person who favours developing a wider interdependency, which has a European dimension. It is for this reason that the debate will become seriously dislodged if it becomes concentrated on confusions that are almost extraneous to the central thrust of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">It is necessary, for example, to define terms. The confusion of war with terrorism is a hopeless quagmire in which to get involved. People have started wars and ended them with treaties, addressed issues of terrorism with security, which, in turn, has been defined in the long term by various governments, including the Irish Government, as eliminating, for example, the sources of terrorism. The term has not been defined in a strictly military sense. To speak of security, defence and militarism in the same breath, almost bracketed together, is an invitation to the public to view what is being proposed negatively, which would be a great pity.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">With regard to the important point I made about the nature of constitutions and treaties, it will take a great deal of effort to explain to people the distance between treaty and constitution, but also the term, institutional reform, upon which the greater concentration of interest has fallen. I know of no constitution ever that referred to concepts such as financial stability, reference to which the European Central Bank would like included in the constitution. This is not the stuff of constitutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">In a curious way, however, the statement published by the European Central Bank in September, exposed an enormous problem with the entire project. The bank wanted a specific assurance that the constitution would refer to fiscal policy being performed within a single, neo-liberal economic model. In other words, it wanted to have lodged in the constitution what would be regarded in the history of economic thought as an aberration from Keynesianism. The European Central Bank expressed its disappointment, not only at the lesser role it was accorded in the final document, on which I congratulate those who participated in the Convention, but also because the specific reference it desired was not included in the final document, which would have been disastrous, not to mention contradictory.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">There are achievements in the document, among them the explicit reference to social Europe. There is no point, however, in dancing around the difficulty which emerges as a result. The commitment to social Europe is entirely contradicted by that which was sought in the commentary issued by the European Central Bank in September.</p>

          <p eId="para_716">It is a flat contradiction. It would suggest, for example, that social protection is the same as the rights accorded under a liberalised labour market or, as it would be called now, a flexible labour market. The most recent figures from the United States show that the average worker there works 147 hours more than in 1974 to maintain the same wage assurance. Flexible labour markets mean a diminution of life chances and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The reference to social Europe is an achievement which allows me to envisage a shape to the European project that is generous. In a way, the contradictions in the text could become a source of a new phase of evolution in Europe. If an economy is seeking to transform into something more, namely, a political entity, which, in turn, is trying to operate in terms of global interdependency redefined, it needs a vision beyond the economic, which is precisely what social Europe affords us.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">While I do not have time to dwell on the issue, I was disappointed by the failure throughout the entire process to rise to the challenge of envisaging what Europe was, is and might become in a cultural sense. This is generally regarded as something one does as an offshoot of the entertainment industry. When Ministers are weary, where does one bring them? The answer lies somewhere between Michael Flatley and Alexander the Great.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">This failure to find the competence to say something significant culturally reveals something else about the document, namely, the diversity to which it refers but to which no commitment is given. I find it offensive that the debate opened up in narrow terms around a question of whether Europe should be regarded as a fundamentally Christian entity or structured on theist systems or something else.

          <p eId="para_730">My point is the opposite of what Deputy Gay Mitchell believes it to be, as he would find out if he had the patience to listen, which is not his habit. I was making the point that Europe consists of more than simple divisions between rationalists and theists or Christians and, as the Deputy charitably called them, so-called liberals. Europe has carried many influences for a long time. The best of Greek scholarship, for example, was saved in southern Spain by Arabs.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">With the greatest respect, I dislike being shouted down by a Deputy expressing the narrow view that it is a matter of confronting people who are either rationalist—</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_733">I would oppose any reference in a European constitution to rationalism alone. Rationalism is a moment in the history of western philosophy. I have never advocated the reduction of European philosophy to rationalism because all the influences in Europe, including the Christian faith, other faiths and the spiritual values that happen not to have been given a name, must be respected and heard. That is my view and I will not have it distorted.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">If we are to face into the future we have to listen to those who have interesting debates on, for example, the nature of constitutionalism. Constitutionalism existed before democracy. Constitutions do not automatically create democracy. That raises other valuable points in this debate, including the incorporation of the charter on human rights. It is important that they be turned, through instruments of monitoring, implementation and peer review, into something meaningful and achievable. There are lessons in this historically. The United States constitution existed for a long time before everybody had the vote and when people were segregated to the back of buses.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">Interestingly, there is a distinction between liberalism, constitutionalism and democracy. With regard to my earlier remarks, far from being a so-called liberal, which I am not, I appreciate that the crude and ignorant views of neo-liberal economists have been mitigated to some extent by those who participated in the Convention and I congratulate them on that. Certain words trip off the neo-liberals' tongues. They never speak of the rights of the person but of the rights of the individual. They are not able to rise to the rights of the person, which is in the fundamental jurisprudence irrespective of whether one has property. Individualism comes out of the bankrupt rational tradition that gave us Friedrich von Hayek and the other people that influenced the poisonous theories of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">There are other interesting and important matters which I hope we will discuss in the course of this debate. An interesting issue arises for those who participated in the Convention and those who will participate in debates during the Irish Presidency, that is, the kind of myth which has been created – I am using the term "myth" in the positive Greek sense of <i>muthos</i>– that if there is a founding myth in Europe it is that Europe would be at peace and never at war again. If one wishes to move beyond that, given that it has been translated with accession countries into an increasing emphasis on trade and so forth to create a strong, viable economic entity, one must ask oneself what would be an appropriate vision or myth for the next phase.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The distinctive characteristics of European culture are empowering and enabling. The idea that there would be a large number of countries with a vast population, diverse influences on their culture, many different belief systems which are not simply materialist and which is committed to different forms of production, offers the capacity to create something other than an empire which is unamenable to accountability and democracy. That is the opportunity. It is different from an economic area in which there would be unaccountable transnational corporations operating without regulation with regard to labour and environmental standards. All the opportunities are before us if the vision is created.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">I am happy that the document provides for a considerable amount of protection. I welcome the words "social Europe" and "sustainable", as a powerful if insufficient restraint on the concept of growth. I also welcome the inclusion of rights even though I would prefer that the specificity of their achievement and implementation were more clearly defined. I look forward to the debate. It is welcome that we should be thinking so positively as to try to envisage a world without war. There is nothing wrong with envisaging a planet that could live without the scourge of war and those who purvey the politics of fear have a negative and dark vision of our world.</p>

          <p eId="para_741">I welcome the fact that the Minister has clarified a number of issues and I echo his comments about the Irish participants on the Convention. I pay tribute to them and to the members of the Civil Service who did, and continue to do, such magnificent work in the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The question we must ask ourselves from the outset is, to what type of Europe do we aspire. I aspire to a Europe which is ecologically sustainable. We need to look at the present constitution and ask where we are going with it and whether we are making advances. The answer is that we are not making any advance on Amsterdam. The eight big environmental organisations put down certain amendments but, unfortunately, they were not accepted. However, we did not go backwards, which is a victory of sorts. Likewise, we aspire to a Europe that is nuclear free. Again, we avoided having the EURATOM Treaty included in the constitution but there is still no sunset clause, for which we had called. A number of members of the Convention signed an amendment to that effect but it was not accepted. We are as we were, so to speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Do we want a Europe that is more militarised? Deputy Mitchell and I part company on this issue. I accept his point of view and I hope he accepts mine. I hope he will not make charges that I am trying to mislead people because I am not. One of the welcome aspects of the constitution is its clarity. Article 40.3 states:</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities. A European Armaments, Research and Military Capabilities Agency shall be established to identify operational requirements, to promote measures to satisfy those requirements, to contribute to identifying and, where appropriate, implementing any measure needed to strengthen the industrial and technological base of the defence sector. . . .</p>
          <p eId="para_745">That is clear. I do not support it. I do not see the need for us to compete militarily with the United States, which seems to be the objective of some in the Convention. Article 40.7 is also clear:</p>
          <p eId="para_746">Until such time as the European Council has acted in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, closer cooperation shall be established, in the Union framework, as regards mutual defence. Under this cooperation, if one of the Member States participating in such cooperation is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other participating States shall give it aid and assistance by all the means in their power, military or other. . . . .</p>
          <p eId="para_747">My colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, referred to the Article 5 commitment and this sounds like an Article 5 commitment. It is up to those states to participate in closer co-operation. Does that closer co-operation require a referendum in this country? The reference is: "Until such time as the European Council has acted. . . " and that is the reference that was made by Deputy Mitchell. It seems clear that this type of co-operation would not require a referendum in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I also aspire to a democratic Europe and a Europe that treats its citizens and states equally. I do not have a problem with the idea of inserting references to God into this constitution although it should not be an exclusively Christian God. I take the arguments that have been made by my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, on rationalism. He is quite right. The point is that we aspire in the charter to a social Europe, but what is going on in adopting the neo-liberal policies – and we refer to it in Article 133 of the Nice treaty – is that, regarding commercial policy, education, health and social affairs are now no longer exceptions. Those areas are open. Perhaps Members watched Hans Eichel deliver his budget speech. The Germans, who for me exemplified the idea of a social state, are cutting public spending and reducing taxation. That is where we are heading. On the one hand, we aspire to a social Europe, but in reality we are copying the neo-liberal policies of the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The Minister has said that it makes no sense to be dogmatic or confrontational. It is difficult to imagine the Minister being confrontational. As we know, it is simply not in his nature. The Minister should go in there and negotiate. He has said today that many countries are arguing strongly for one voting commissioner per member state. Is he arguing for that? I ask him to do so. In Dublin Castle, he said that the present constitution represents an advance on Nice regarding the Commission. It does not, and the Minister acknowledges that here. He should go in, bat for us and negotiate. I have no problem with his negotiating, and I wish him well.</p>

          <p eId="para_751">The draft constitution is more than a necessary consolidation and simplification of existing treaties. It makes fundamental changes in the structures of the EU, giving them more powers, and it gives the EU a single legal personality for the first time. The effect is to shift the balance of power yet further from sovereign national parliaments and towards the EU, the biggest single step so far towards the creation of an EU super-state. We have already communicated to the Government the minimum changes we believe the Irish negotiators should be demanding in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to protect Ireland's sovereignty.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">Our more serious concerns include Article I-5(1), which states that the Union shall respect "national identities" and "regional and local self-government". Significantly, it makes no reference to national sovereignty or national self-government. The constitution should recognise that "the social and economic well-being of their people" are among "essential State functions". That would emphasise the right of states to control their own economies, a right currently undermined by the EU. Article I-10 states that the constitution and law adopted by the EU institutions "shall have primacy over the law of the member states" in exercising competences conferred on the EU. That would firmly establish EU law as superior to national law. That, in effect, creates a federal state and a federal law, and we believe that the provision entails the diminution of basic democratic rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">The new EU constitution will require Ireland to cede most or all of her remaining independence in foreign policy to the EU. Article I-11(4) establishes EU competence in the area of common foreign and security policy, thus giving it primacy. The draft constitution states at Article I-15(1) and (2) that the Union shall have a common foreign and security policy that covers "all areas of foreign policy and questions relating to the Union's security, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, which might lead to a common defence". The draft constitution also requires the convergence of member states' foreign policies. At a minimum, our negotiators must protect the Irish exercise of sovereign independence in international affairs by securing an explicit statement that EU competence in foreign policy is shared and that, as with development co-operation and humanitarian aid, the exercise of EU competence in foreign policy will not result in member states being prevented from exercising their competence in foreign policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">We have long warned that the EU is becoming progressively militarised. Some dismissed that as exaggeration, but the provisions in the constitution confirm that prediction. It provides for the establishment of a common defence that can act outside the Union, including to strengthen international security using member states' capabilities. It allows that to include the deployment of forces to third countries to support counter-terrorism campaigns, and it takes very little imagination to see the potential for significant problems and that the doctrine of pre-emption that promoted the invasion of Iraq is thereby indirectly authorised. It further states that EU defence policies shall not prejudice NATO states – and further, shall be compatible with NATO. However, the special rights and responsibilities of militarily neutral states are not explicitly acknowledged, and that is one of the main duties of our negotiators in the weeks and months ahead.</p>

        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_411">
          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_755">I am very pleased to have this opportunity to contribute briefly to statements on the European Convention. Before I outline the issues about which I am concerned, I acknowledge once again the efforts made by all members of the Irish delegation in the convention and the Praesidium, as well as the ongoing briefings by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, to the Joint Committee on European Affairs regarding upcoming Council or Intergovernmental Conference meetings. It certainly gives us an opportunity to hear the Government's stance and voice our concerns. Whether they are taken on board is for the Minister to say, but at least we have the opportunity to make our point.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">At the meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs last week, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, made it clear, as he has done from the very beginning, that his position and that of the Government is that the Intergovernmental Conference cannot simply be a rubber stamp for the work of the Convention. According to the Minister, the draft treaty is a good basis on which to work, and Ireland will come up with some constructive proposals to effect change in certain areas. While I accept the Minister's assurances and his intentions in this regard, the signals coming from the EU are somewhat in conflict with his assertions.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The stated aim of the Intergovernmental Conference is to depart as little as possible from the balanced text which resulted from 18 months of negotiations. The Presidency has proposed the principle of alternative consensus, whereby the current draft should stay if agreement cannot be found on an alternative proposal. That means that they will rely on the text of the convention if no other proposals are put forward. However, if other proposals are put forward and there is no agreement, it seems to be the intention to revert to the original draft. According to the Minister, Ireland will have several key concerns which he will press. Yet it seems that the proposed timetable – the Italians are determined to see this through during their Presidency – and the principle of alternative consensus that I have just mentioned will make for very difficult negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">I will comment briefly on some issues of concern to me in the draft treaty. The first is the composition of the Commission. The Nice treaty offered a constitutional guarantee of equal rotation of the full voting members of the Commission. It also provided that, of the enlarged membership of 25, each member state would have one Commissioner with voting rights, and that only after the treaty of accession of the 27th member would a system of rotation come into force. That principle must be upheld, and I agree with Deputy Gormley that the Minister should negotiate very strongly on the issue. I am not quite sure of his exact position. However, as far as the Irish people are concerned, they have only just voted on Nice and accepted its conditions, and they will not easily be convinced that what is now being proposed is better.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">It is also critical for Ireland's interests to maintain unanimous voting on fiscal issues. In contrast to the draft constitutional treaty, the Commission proposed to move towards qualified majority voting, particularly in the domains of taxation in connection with the operation of the Internal Market and the role of the European public prosecutor in safeguarding the Union's financial interest. Ireland must maintain the line that has already been agreed on this particular matter. I was pleased to hear the Minister state: "It is clear, however, that we will retain our right to make our own decisions on whether to participate in EU crisis management operations."  Unanimous voting on this issue is critical and I welcome the Minister's comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">The principle of subsidiarity could be even further strengthened in the new draft treaty. I am aware of a provision – the Minister already referred to it – whereby if one third of the states object to a draft directive or proposal on the grounds that it breaches subsidiarity, it can be challenged. This means that nine out of 25 countries would have to object. While this is a new and worthwhile development, I suggest that 20% or five of the 25 countries objecting might be sufficient to put the wheels in motion. Five is a substantial number and it would ensure that an issue would be of transnational concern and transgressed the principle of subsidiarity. This principle is already enshrined in the draft treaty so there would be a solid basis for the argument to try to change the numbers involved. In addition, it would send a powerful message to all European citizens regarding the importance of subsidiarity and the ability of the EU to respond flexibly to those concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">I agree with the Minister, Deputy Cowen, that the debate needs to be widened nationally. I recently spoke to a European colleague and asked if his country will put forward the draft treaty in a referendum. His response was that it would not do so because public opinion could not be trusted. I am glad our Constitution ensures that we must trust public opinion on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">In recent years, people in this country have lost faith in large institutions. I will not rehearse the reasons for that now. However, the EU is an extremely large institution and if people are to place their trust in it, they must be fully informed. As Deputy Gay Mitchell stated, we must be imaginative in finding ways to ensure this, we must be consulted and, in certain cases, we must be given guarantees. The Minister stated that it does not always come down to simple arithmetic, but sometimes it does.</p>

Given that I have not yet had the opportunity to do so, I wish to state that it was a real honour to be asked to serve and represent this Parliament on the Convention. I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, on the energetic way he led the delegation, Deputy John Bruton on the vigorous way he represented Irish interests – among others – at the Praesidium and the officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs for the wise guidance they provided at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">The Convention was asked a number of questions, including those relating to how the Union might be brought closer to its citizens, how it might be better organised and how it can best play a positive role in the wider world. In my opinion, the Convention has succeeded, in large part, in finding solutions to these questions. We have seen the beginning of a useful debate and I would recommend to Members, if they have not yet had the opportunity to do so, that they read the report from the Institute of European Affairs which provides a good initial analysis of the draft constitutional treaty. We should try to connect with organisations of that nature in respect of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The outcome of the Convention is to be warmly welcomed. However, its achievements should not be undermined by the Intergovernmental Conference. I was pleased by the Minister's comment – he has made it on previous occasions – that he sees the document as the basis for a successful Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The draft constitutional treaty is easy to read and understand. Part 1 makes clear what the Union is, what it does and what are its values and objectives. It makes absolutely clear that powers are conferred on the Union by the member states, not <i>vice versa,</i> and that any powers not conferred remain with member states. It is disingenuous of people such as Deputy Ó Snodaigh to try to twist the language of the draft constitutional treaty around to portray the position as being otherwise.</p>

          <from>Mr. Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_768">I welcome the Deputy's initiative in articulating his view. However, I believe that view is wrong and we should ensure that it does not gain any active currency.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">The report sets out, clearly and concisely, the division of powers between the Union and the member states. There is a significant reduction in the number of legal instruments. A great deal of that was painstakingly thought out by the various working parties and it should mean that decision-making will become more understandable to citizens. The renaming of the instruments should further contribute to this. It might be a small exercise but it is important that the renaming should be almost self-explanatory.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The charter of fundamental rights was discussed at great length in order to clarify its scope and application. It is clear that the charter will apply to all the EU institutions and member states only when they are implementing EU law. No new competences are created as a result of its proposed incorporation in the draft treaty. It is encouraging that the charter of fundamental rights is being inserted as part of the treaty. This will significantly shift the thrust of the development of Europe and will create for it a new dynamic. Rather than focusing on military aspects and other issues, as some people inside and outside the House would desire, we will be discussing a sustainable, social, caring and inclusive Europe. When it comes to the ratification, there should be many good reasons for our being prepared to recommend the treaty to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The principles of subsidiarity and proportionality have been restated and strengthened. The national parliaments have been given an enhanced role in monitoring compliance. This Parliament is well able and prepared to take up that role. I compliment Deputy Gay Mitchell on the diligence he has displayed since undertaking his job as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I also compliment the Minister and Minister of State for coming before the House on numerous occasions to keep Members abreast of developments at General Affairs and External Relations Councils.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The institutional changes proposed respect the key principles of equality of member states and the balance between the institutions. I do not have time to expand on this issue but I believe it is important and worthy of discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">The draft proposals on Commission composition guarantee equality of access to all members states to the Commission on the same terms. This was a central feature of the Treaty of Nice. Deputy Gormley has some concerns in this regard but, having listened to the Minister both today and on previous occasions, I believe that the equality of member states ultimately will be protected. The draft proposals are, however, a step forward from Nice in that all member states will continue to appoint a commissioner. Under Nice, once the Union had reached 27 members, a smaller Commission was to be agreed. While the current arrangement is good, it would obviously be a further boost if one commissioner per member state is achievable in terms of equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">I am one of those who holds the view that the next Commission should be used as a testing ground to see how effectively it will work with a membership of 25 – ultimately 27 – and with one commissioner per member state. We may well discover that it will be possible to have a very effective Commission of 25 or 27. As stated earlier, with the accession of the ten new countries, a new dynamic will be created within the Union. The development of the latter will be interesting to observe.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">The double majority system of voting will have the advantage, in my view, of being easier to understand. I would be happy to retain the system agreed at Nice, but I defy most people to tell me that they understand the intricacies of weighted voting or qualified majority voting.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">While the overall outcome of the Convention is to be warmly welcomed, as the Minister said, the Intergovernmental Conference should not be a rubber stamp. It is important that real negotiations can take place. I served on the working party which discussed the area of taxation. Our view, articulated with the assistance of Department of Finance officials, prevailed at the working group. The Government identified the issues of taxation, criminal procedure and security and defence. These would benefit from further debate at the Intergovernmental Conference. The work programme of the Presidency appears to offer the scope to raise these issues and I welcome this.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">I share the Government's view that unanimity is appropriate in the taxation area given its fundamental centrality to national political and economic life. It is an area that we should ensure is copper-fastened. Reading the reports of the discussions that have already taken place, I am confident that will be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Ireland's distinctive legal tradition also makes it appropriate to maintain unanimity in some of the new articles on criminal law, especially on procedural aspects. I agree that these are areas of great sensitivity. From our experience in discussing this issue with our European colleagues, I believe it is not well understood that our common law system is different from the legal system which applies in the rest of Europe. It should be possible to come to an arrangement where mutual recognition of particular provisions would be possible and certain areas of criminal procedure could be advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">As regards defence, I feel further work is required to avoid the risk of fragmentation and incoherence in the Union. This is a serious risk. There is a need to look carefully again at these ideas. However, it seems clear that Ireland is not being asked to take on any obligations incompatible with our neutrality.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The Convention has done much good work. Both the Government and the Oireachtas representatives have helped to produce a draft treaty which, I hope, will be well received. It is now up to the Intergovernmental Conference to conclude that work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_415">
          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_781">This is an important debate. However, it is important that it be conducted on a rational basis and without reference to slogans. Without being unduly critical, in the contribution of our Sinn Féin colleague I noticed that he shares an approach with the British Conservative Party in the very narrow view of the EU as being a super-state. The powers of the EU in many ways are less than those of the State of California, that has been so much in the news lately. As Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, I recall being sent to every capital in Europe begging the member states to provide temporary funding. The EC, as it was at the time, did not have the power to borrow money. As far as I know it still does not have that power. Let us be rational about the debate and not deal in slogans.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">How will the Government ensure that Ireland's interests are best protected during the Intergovernmental Conference? There is almost bound to be an over-spill into the Irish Presidency and this will create particular difficulties. While I am not in any way impugning the ability of the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, in this issue, Ireland will then be in the position of an honest broker between 25 countries that are all trying to look after their own interests. Ireland's supreme concern at that time will be to act as honest broker and this will leave us without the weight to single-mindedly pursue our national interests. Let us see how that might cause problems. Before he left for Nice, the Taoiseach assured virtually the whole world that we were going to have a Commissioner with a vote in perpetuity. He had to compromise.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">There is also an issue regarding tax harmonisation and qualified majority voting. Britain and Ireland were in a common position. I suggested in a light-hearted manner to the Minister at a European affairs meeting recently that we were on the coattails of Britain. If we have a common interest we should obviously use that position. I agree with Deputy Carey that it is important for the country, for a variety of economic and social reasons, that we ensure we hold to unanimity on this issue. I am quite concerned about recent reports that Britain may be shifting, or at least weakening, on this. I can see how it could happen and could cause difficulties for us in the Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Let us consider the defence arrangements. Of course, there is a difference between the group led by France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and pre-Berlusconi Italy which has a particular view of the future defence arrangements for the Union and the other group, led by Britain and including the Netherlands and Denmark which represents, as it were, the pro-NATO view within Europe. It may be that the French view will not be accepted. My concern is there might be a <i>quid pro quo</i> as far as Britain is concerned. Is that the reason it has sent out signals that it might weaken on the tax harmonisation issue? By coincidence, the French, Belgians and others in that camp, really want tax harmonisation. I foresee difficulties and I am warning the Government to be prepared for the difficulties that may arise when we have the Presidency. It will not be all glory. There are national interests that will have to be defended and we must be prepared to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">The same will arise regarding the Commission and that needs to be teased out further. The Commission has always been the ally of small member states. I am a little concerned about the two-tier Commission with the voting college and non-voting college, something like the position of Ministers and Ministers of State. I am concerned more so that the voting college of 15 will consist of a president, who may not be from a small member state, plus the Union's Minister for Foreign Affairs. I detect a signal from the Minister of State that there will be rotation involved. There will be a reluctance to have a Union Minister for Foreign Affairs from a small member state.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">There has been a <i>volte-face</i> to some degree on the charter of fundamental rights. At Nice, Britain and Ireland did not want any justiciable charter – we were in for a political declaration. The British have gone the other way and so have we. We need to have an understanding as to why we took that position and why there has been a change. I am not saying that I object to the change, but I think it needs to be explained to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">As regards the preamble, I do not adopt a holy Joe approach. At the same time, I do not think we should go overboard in ignoring the reality that is a common Christian heritage. Of course there are minorities and we have to look to the accession of Turkey. I see no reason why the reality should not include a reference to our common Christian heritage. Why not? As it is currently framed, it is like a French secular constitution ignoring reality, ignoring God. This should be re-examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I would like to refer to the legal instruments proposed by the Convention. Generally, I think the change is good from the perspective of a re-christening of regulations, which is what they are as they are directly applicable. It also re-christens the directives as European framework laws and this is a correct description as the onus is on member states to implement them. This raises the issue about our deplorable record of implementing directives. I have raised this issue before and would have thought that coming up to the Presidency, we might have shown some good example. I am horrified by the responses to some Dáil questions I tabled recently. An enormous number of directives have not been transposed and clearly will not be transposed by the time we take over the Presidency. Clearly they will not be transposed by the time we take over the Presidency. In the environment area, there are 12 directives to be transposed, five of which are overdue. We could be hauled up before the European Court because of those five directives. That would not be a good start to our Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">In the transport area, there are 19 directives to be transposed, 15 of which are late. The Minister for Transport is missing the bus on this matter. In the finance area, there are 13 directives to be transposed, three of which are late. In the health area, there are ten to be transposed, which is an unhealthy outcome, and seven of those are late. The area I must mention is the Tánaiste's Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Her reply on this matter was very coy and did not mention the number of directives to be transposed or the number which were late. She referred me to a website, but when I checked it, it was not accessible. I wonder whether that was by accident or design, but is it a coincidence that we have the most appalling record in the Tánaiste's Department, where 30 directives are waiting to be transposed? Coming into the Presidency we should be setting some kind of example in so far as that is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">I compliment the Department of Foreign Affairs on its explanatory guide, which is simple, clear-cut and will contribute to the public debate. I want much more openness and transparency in the public debate on this issue. The Government should be prepared to tease out issues as they arrive so that when the final treaty is ultimately agreed, we can all, or as many of us as possible, endorse it wholeheartedly and ensure the referendum is passed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaeSextonPD" eId="spk_416">
          <from>Ms Sexton</from>
          <p eId="para_791">I wish to share my time with Deputy Eoin Ryan.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The purpose of the Convention on the Future of Europe was to simplify the European treaties, to make Union policy-making more effective and to bring it closer to the people. The first two aims could be seen as legalistic and technical, perhaps to be understood only by lawyers, administrators and some politicians. The third aim is the key – to bring the European Union closer to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">This means that the writing of a new constitutional treaty for the European Union is a political project and the process and the text are complex and technical. The new text has involved the work of thousands of people as well as hundreds of delegates at the Convention, but it will only reach its full conclusion when it is put to a referendum in our country and in others.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">We can only hope to bring political institutions close to the people if they are relevant, effective and subject to their control. In national politics, we do not try to impress people by elaborating on the Standing Orders of the House. We do not try to show them the importance of the Oireachtas by arguing about who heads which committee. We do not show them democracy at work by sending them <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> We do it by working to solve real problems, creating real opportunities and responding to people's real needs and wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">I expect the new constitutional treaty will be judged by its relevance, effectiveness and responsiveness. The people have shown themselves willing and ready to engage in intelligent and informed debate about European issues. The Treaty of Nice referenda and the campaigns in both cases have surely taught us that we have nothing to fear from full debate. People want our country not to be defensive about our role and our interests in Europe, but to be confident in advancing our interests, strategic in our thinking and realistic in our objectives and goals.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">There is much in the draft constitutional treaty that Ireland can and should accept. We can reaffirm our commitment to and membership of the European Union that we ourselves have helped develop over 30 years. Much of the substance of the EU will not have changed and that is not a bad thing. We can expect that none of the positive achievements of the European Union will be lost in this new constitutional treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">The balance of institutional power in the European Union will change to some degree, depending on the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference, but it is safe to say that the sharing of competences in the Union and the checks and balances of power will remain very largely those we have used to date. The EU is not being fundamentally redesigned with a constitution modelled on the federal United States of America.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">Let us also be clear, however, that we have some legitimate concerns about aspects of the draft constitutional treaty. These concerns are as valid as those expressed by any other member state. In some cases member states managed to get key national priorities reflected in the text at the Convention and, in particular instances, at the very last moment. It should not matter at what stage of the process, between the start of the Convention and the end of the Intergovernmental Conference, that national bottom lines are addressed. It is clear from the Intergovernmental Conference meeting on Monday that it is proposed that the draft Constitution is useful in setting out a framework and Ireland must be vigilant in negotiation of the detail within that framework. For example, regarding the proposal to appoint a Foreign Minister who would have a foot in two camps, it is imperative that the detail regarding this appointment is hammered out and pinned down very securely to ensure that no tensions are created.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">We have not yet achieved the clear position on direct tax policy that we want, namely, that unanimity will continue to apply in all cases and as a permanent constitutional matter. I am confident that the Irish position on tax will be achieved by the Government negotiators and I have supreme confidence in the Minister of State with responsibility for Europe, Deputy Roche, given what was achieved at Nice by the Taoiseach and in our second Nice referendum, when we said a "Yes" vote would confirm our people's approval of that negotiating stance and outcome. Now we have the strength of a direct, strong mandate behind our position on tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">In the area of defence and security policy, the text is still up for negotiation to a large degree and it is difficult for all of us to predict the final shape. However, there is no prospect of the Union developing any automatic defence commitment such as NATO's mutual defence policy in its Article V. Not many countries want that and Ireland certainly does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">At the same time, let us not pretend to the public that Europe as a whole does not have security issues to address. We have issues regarding maintaining peace, security and human rights in bordering States. We have to counter human trafficking and we have to combat terrorism and international crime. No self-respecting mature state in the world exists without a security policy. Our security is bound up intimately with our EU partners and the international security situation. There is no reason that we cannot voluntarily, and on a case by case basis, show a willingness to help fellow member states in certain emergencies, just as we would be grateful for their help if we faced a crisis. So long as we retain national control over our defence forces in all cases, as we will, we have nothing to fear from the development of a European security and defence policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I was heartened to see also at the Intergovernmental Conference on Monday that a broad consensus emerged on a number of general guidelines like the extension of the Petersberg Tasks and the solidarity clause in combating terrorism. It is vitally important that if we are proposing to extend our participation beyond the existing commitments, the Government must clearly spell out in detail how Ireland will become involved in these tasks and explain to the electorate that our traditional neutral position and support of UN-sanctioned peacekeeping and monitoring activities are not undermined. The European Union is be a key force for peace and security and I wish the Minister well in his negotiations.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EoinRyan" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Mr. Eoin Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_803">I thank Deputy Sexton for sharing her time. I too welcome this draft constitution and congratulate all those involved in it, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputies John Bruton, Carey, Gormley, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, and Gay Mitchell, the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and Mr. Bobby McDonagh and the Department of Foreign Affairs for all the work they have done so far. This has been a huge task and many wondered at the start if those involved could achieve it, but they have done so because they worked together. As has been said, the process took approximately 17 months but this is an important and exciting document and on behalf of all of us I thank them for the work they have done over the past 17 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The document will help to make Europe more democratic and more governable, as other speakers have said. It was not put together behind closed doors. The process was very open – all member states were represented at both Government and parliamentary levels, the media covered it extensively and hundreds of papers were involved in the process. The Convention allowed us to see a clear description of the EU's objectives, values, powers and institutions. That is a good aspect because those of us who knocked on doors in support of various EU treaties are aware that people have found them difficult to understand. In many cases people voted for previous treaties because they trusted politicians and others. During the campaign on the last EU treaty people wanted a clear description and understanding of exactly for what they would be voting. That is why this constitution is timely.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">The Intergovernmental Conference faces a great challenge. As the Minister said, it is important for those involved in looking forward to also look back. The Europe Union is a success. One need only reflect on what it has allowed this and other member states to achieve. We have had a common market for our commercial development. Some 25 member states are discussing a new constitution for the Union. Who would have thought that possible a few years ago? We have a new strong currency, the euro, which is probably too strong for some of our exporters. Who would have thought a few years ago that development would have occurred, having regard to the exchange rate mechanism that was in place and what happened in regard to the English pound, with people running scared of the introduction of the euro and saying it could never work? It has worked. Who would have thought it would have been possible for the European Union to be involved in Bosnia? Many positive developments have occurred within the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Another such development is that the Union is about to absorb 75 million people from eastern Europe. The European Union has it critics and problems, but it is moving forward. When one considers the influence of certain people currently in the United States, it is important that Europe is seen to be strong and that its people stand together and make sure we stand up to some of the influence currently being exercised within the American system.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">There have always been sceptics in every member state about the European Union, but alongside them have been those with a passionate idealism about what Europe is and its importance. Those people have clashed in many ways, but that debate has been a driving force for the Union. It is sad to read the comments of the leader of the British Conservative Party on this draft constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">I wish the Intergovernmental Conference well. Those involved must take account of national interest and common European interest. They must look back as they look forward because one need only reflect on the positive developments and the gains achieved in the Union. There are many more gains to be made in the future through this draft constitution. I wish the Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, the Taoiseach and all those involved in this process well. The future of Europe lies in the provisions of this draft constitution. This is an exciting time for all of us living in Europe. I hope the debate on the draft constitution will be a success.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_811">I congratulate the Minister on his contribution. As the previous speaker said, this is an interesting time for Europe, but it is also a challenging time. We have come through the first phase, that of the first 50 years, successfully. The next phase is a challenge. It is a bigger arena where there are more competing powers and there is the re-emergence of nationalism that existed many years ago. There is also the matter of our own nationalism. Every member state would like to have absolute control over the future of the European Union, what direction it takes, its policies and its constitution. If one accepts that principle, we will reach the stage where the more powerful will survive. We have seen some evidence of that in more recent times, where the more powerful tend to influence everybody else. That is a slight departure from what my colleague, Deputy Michael Higgins, used to poetically refer to some years ago as the situation where everything was very <i>communitaire.</i> He was correct because everything was very <i>communitaire</i> in the lead up to where we are now. However, there tends to be less emphasis on those who are less powerful and a little more emphasis in moving us inexorably in a particular direction and telling us where we are going when we are there.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">I pay tribute to the stance taken by Deputy Mitchell, particularly in relation to defence, although many Members present would not agree with that. We can either be outside calling on those inside to listen to our voice or we can be inside influencing the outcome. We have a choice. Those who are in the position of making that choice should do it now and ensure that we retain influence at this crucial juncture. Deputy Mitchell is absolutely right in his stance. He was right in his reading of the situation in the run-up to the Iraq war and events have since proved him correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">We also need to recognise that we must get the correct balance in Europe as it evolves. I was a member of the original Convention on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and at one of the first meetings I attended I could not understand why we were going that route, given that it was a simple matter to introduce a constitution. What worries me now is that the draft constitution is slightly more complicated and longer than I would have thought at that time. It is difficult to assuage the fears of many people and to meet the requirement of others to ensure the constitution is short and succinct. That presents a difficulty, but it should not be forgotten that the simplest of constitutions will remain in the public mind as well in the mind of the nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">In the time available it is difficult to develop one's thinking on this issue. However, the Minister said that we need to become more aware of Europe and Europe needs to be more aware of us – by "us" I mean all the nations of Europe. Instead of looking at each other as if we were British, German, French, from Luxembourg or one of the new applicant countries, we need to look at each other as Europeans. We need to recognise that we have an equal right to whatever happens in Europe and that in developing our economic, social, political and any other policies we want to trot out we should proceed in a way that will recognise the rights and the need to provide equity throughout the Union rather than in a way that is oblivious or impervious to the needs of others.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_421">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_815">I am glad this debate, the first of many such debates, is taking place. I point out to the Minister, the Government and to everyone who is pro-Europe that there are people who are anti-Europe and who do not agree with what is in the draft constitution. Those people have rights and they will not be dictated to by central government or the leaders of political parties. These people will have a right in the next few months to put forward another point of view. They will have an opportunity to debate this issue in public with the Ministers of the day and the Government. I hope the Government and everyone involved in this process will get the opportunity to explain, in simple layperson's terms, to the people what is involved in this process and that they will not hide particular issues under the carpet.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">The previous debate on Europe got nasty at the end and the people decided wisely. I am a democrat and I accept whatever the people decide. The people will get another opportunity to decide in this regard because people in the past talked about this constitution. We can look back to the foundation of this State and to our Constitution. The people who drafted it were wise and it has stood the test of time. I am worried, as are many people, that we will be taken over by Europe, that the introduction of a European constitution will take over this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue visited my constituency today while this House was sitting. He has no respect for the House or the Parliament if he is away opening swimming pools and leisure centres on a Wednesday when he should be in this House. If we have no respect for the House, we are merely rubber-stamping the legislation coming in from Europe. We are already doing that and will be doing much more of it if this draft constitution goes through.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">What sickens me about Europe is that it reminds me of what used to go on in this country for the past 50 years. Failed politicians were shoved into the Upper House, the Seanad. Some of them got jobs as group leaders, spokespersons or leas-chathaoirligh after losing their Dáil seats. We now have a situation whereby former taoisigh and Ministers will, just as happens in Britain, be shoved into Europe and given jobs for the boys and girls. It is happening already. It is a bit like the dual mandate, with dynasties being perpetuated. An ex-Minister who loses a Dáil seat or resigns, and fails to get a seat in the Seanad to act perhaps as Leas-Chathaoirleach, will be given a plum job in Europe. That is what is happening now.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">We then have the situation regarding the EU Commissioner, a most powerful man. We are talking of a president of the European Council who will not even be elected. The Irish Commissioner should go before the people and be elected by them. Otherwise he or she should not be allowed to represent the country. The current selection process is not appropriate. It looks like we will lose our own Commissioner. We have already lost two MEPs and we will lose more. Our influence in Europe will diminish.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">In the area of European law, someone referred to the euro. The European constitution is a joke, as is the whole European scene. I will give two very simple examples. If the euro is working so well, why is Britain allowed to stay outside the eurozone? We are either in Europe or not. The second example is one I always give when speaking about Europe. As far back as when we joined the EEC, we were told that we would have free movement of people and free movement of cars. To this day, one cannot go into any European country and buy a car without being obliged to pay VRT when arriving back with it at an Irish border. Is that not disgraceful?</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_823">Together with other Deputies, I am happy to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. When the draft constitution is ultimately passed by the member states in the Intergovernmental Conference, when it comes before the people and becomes the constitution of the European Union, history will show it to be one of the most historic documents ever to be passed or agreed to by the nations of Europe going back 100 years. It will be seen to be more significant than the Treaty of Rome, the Treaty of Maastricht, the Amsterdam Treaty and the Single European Act. For the people of Europe to agree to combine all the past piecemeal agreements towards the integration of Europe in one agreement shows the ultimate maturity and coming together of the nations of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">There are different views within this House on this agreement, and as Deputy Ring has pointed out there are very different views outside the House, which we should not disregard. Whatever one's views, one should not deny the enormity of the task and of the achievement in reducing the common goals and aspirations contained in all of the treaties to date to a very simple, straightforward and short text such as this. That is an enormous achievement. Huge credit should go to Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and to all those involved in the Convention, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, as well as Deputies Gormley and Carey who assisted in that enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">The most welcome part of this draft constitution is the fact that any citizen of the European Union and any citizen of Ireland can take it up – unlike any of the previous treaties which ran to hundreds of pages and were bogged down in the complexities of European administrative language – and see at first hand what the European Union is about and to what we are subscribing if we support the constitution. That is a great achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">I will confine my comments to Articles 2 and 3 of the draft constitution. I wonder if it is a coincidence that these two articles set out the values and the objectives of the European Union in the same way that the Irish Constitution formerly set out our national aspirations. As we all know, we ceded and diluted those aspirations for a greater goal. In subscribing to Articles 2 and 3 of the EU draft constitution we will again be ceding our national aspirations for the greater goal of European integration, that great goal to which we have been aspiring for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">I will quote if I may from Article 2: "The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. These values are common to the member States in a society of pluralism, tolerance, justice, solidarity and non-discrimination."  This is plain and simple English. Everyone in this House and in the member states of the European Union should be able to subscribe to those values. Having said that, listening to the Private Members' debate last night I wondered if some Members of the House subscribe to the rule of law. I do not want to go down that road at this particular time.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_829">The judges subscribe to it. Ultimately, they are the people who enforce the law in this country. Either we are democrats or we are not. If we subscribe to a constitution and to a rule of law, we must abide by it. Unfortunately, a small minority in this country does not do so. That is the ultimate inexpression of democracy if I may put it like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I am very pleased to see that concepts such as sustainable development are now incorporated into the draft text in a positive, prescriptive way. It states: "The European Union shall combat social exclusion and discrimination and shall promote social justice and protection, equality between men and women, solidarity between the generations and protection of children's rights."  These are values to which everyone in Ireland can and should subscribe. The text is presented in plain and simple English.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">Article 3(3) of the draft text notes that the Union "shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity and shall ensure Europe's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced". That is very important because it recognises the diversity of the European nations and people. Part of the difficulty we have in selling, so to speak, a treaty or constitution such as this, lies in explaining to people that this is not a takeover by Europe, as Deputy Ring might have us believe. It respects the diversity of the peoples of Europe as well as the countries and their unique traditions. That is something I very much welcome in the draft text.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Most important, it recognises the principles of sustainable development and recognises that the Union we have today, with its rights, obligations and duties to citizens, is not just for the citizens of today but for the generations to come. In terms of sustainable development and the protection of the environment these are positive obligations, which in my understanding have not been incorporated quite as explicitly into previous treaties.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">I welcome the title of the constitution in terms of the Union competences and subsidiarity and proportionality. For the first time, the principles binding all institutions of the EU, in particular in the area of competency of the institutions, have been set out clearly and concisely. In that regard, I also welcome the provisions on defence taxation and criminal procedures. The essential essence of our sovereignty as a sovereign country lies in the defence of our people, our ability to raise tax and spend money and on the protection of our people. I am glad the constitution respects those important principles.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_839">I thank the Minister of State for being so accommodating.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">We should welcome the existence of an all-embracing document taking into account all preceding treaties and the simplicity of language, which replaces the convoluted legal prose of the existing treaties. We should welcome the existence of a process that was far more open than any process linked with the preceding treaties.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">This process emanated from those in Europe who expressed scepticism, those in Denmark and France who asked questions on the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties and those in Sweden who raised questions relating to the euro. It is a belated attempt by decision-makers in Europe to come to terms with the fact that a democratic deficit continues to exist between them and the people of Europe. We should, for this reason, welcome the belated acceptance that has brought about the constitutional treaty which in many respects is a huge improvement on what has preceded it</p>
          <p eId="para_842">Unfortunately, gaps remain in the process. The accession countries have not been properly involved. They have expressed reservations and are entering into the Intergovernmental Conference making known those reservations which were not aired in the convention because they did not have voting rights. This is what we have been told by the accession countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The trend of individuals making decisions on behalf of the many still remains. Power is being concentrated in favour of the larger countries instead of the smaller ones. These concerns will also come before the European Council and the Intergovernmental Conference. We retain the fascination that a military component should exist as part of the European Union, most evident in the proposal for a European armaments industry in the actual text of the constitution. Why not propose a European pornography industry or a European recreational drugs agency? That would have the same benefit in terms of the economies of Europe and would operate on the same moral basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">While this document is a huge improvement on what has gone before, it has many flaws which the Government must be prepared to tackle not alone in the interests of this country but on behalf of the individual citizen in Europe and on behalf of smaller countries within the European Union.</p>

          <p eId="para_845">I thank the Minister of State for allowing me two minutes of his time to contribute to this debate on the European Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">It is essential that in all debates on Europe the views of 40% of Irish people are listened to and respected. These people, whom I represent, have genuine questions about Europe and it is a disgrace that the political, social and economic elite are often dismissive and constantly try to distort our vision of Europe and the world in general. These are the real issues that should be dealt with in this debate. Many of us have genuine democratic concerns and are trying to defend the interests of working people and the more marginalised in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">A Europe that does not respect and take care of its people is going nowhere. Among our concerns are the following: Will this European constitution override the national sovereignty of each member state? Is this a further step in the formation of a super-state? We all support closer economic and social co-operation but is this the EU sticking its nose into the business of other states on internal matters? Have we not learned from history? There is nothing wrong with Ireland taking a strong, independent line on international and national issues. Will this create a more centralised and democratic Europe? These are fundamental questions which deserve honest and straight answers. I am concerned about the direction in which we are moving. An open debate must be top of the agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">I welcome the earlier comment from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Irish people are not naive and starry eyed about Europe. However, many of us feel the Minister and his colleagues in Government are starry eyed about it. Its reaction during the Nice referendum showed a lack of tolerance for the "no" side. I challenge the major political parties in this House to listen to the views of our citizens. A classic example is Article 2 of the draft treaty – some call it a constitution – which states that the Union is founded on human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. Article 3 confirms that the Union's aim is to promote peace, freedom, justice, sustainable development and full employment. These are principles on which we can all agree. For a while I thought I was listening to the words of Wolfe Tone or Robert Emmet. These articles could easily apply to an independent Republic, which I hope we will achieve some day in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">I hope the Minister of State took note of the genuine concerns expressed by the people in the recent opinion poll in <i>The Irish TImes</i> on the EU and the people's desire for Ireland to assert a strong, independent foreign policy line.</p>

          <p eId="para_850">The articles to which the Deputy referred are fine articles that outline aspirations which sit very well with the tradition of Wolfe Tone and Emmet and the democratic traditions of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">It was my great honour to represent Ireland at the Convention. I join with the Minister in paying the warmest of tributes to those Members of the Oireachtas who played a constructive role in the discussions. Ireland was the only country attending the Convention where the majority of the representations were not from the Government parties. Ireland had the most open approach to the Convention. Some said, at the time, it was a gamble but it was a gamble worth taking because the contributions made by Members from all sides of this House meant we had the most extraordinarily cohesive approach in the Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">I pay a particularly warm tribute to other representatives who did an extraordinary job, in particular, Mr. Bobby McDonagh from the Department of Foreign Affairs who played an extraordinary and patriotic role in the Convention as did other officials from the Department. I also thank colleagues from the House for the role they played in facilitating a more active and lively debate on European issues. I thank in particular Deputy Gay Mitchell and his committee and Deputy Ruairí Quinn who is not often mentioned in this regard but whose advice and guidance I greatly appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">It is true that in discussing the future of Europe we are discussing issues of great consequence to every citizen not just in this country but right across Europe. From my attendance at the Intergovernmental Conference earlier this week, it is clear that much of what the Convention has proposed will stand. That is so because much of what has been proposed is good. There is widescale appreciation that significant progress has been made towards making European fundamental law and the constitutional treaty more legible and more accessible to the people. It is a legal document and legal text tends to involve tensions between the need to make a document like this clear while at the same time creating legal certainty. This does not always result in the most elegant form. In fact, there are areas in the Convention which are not elegant and could do with improvement. However, while the Convention text is not perfect, it stands head and shoulders, as Deputy Boyle said – and I recognise his positive contribution – above the treaties it will replace. It is readable, legible and understandable, as it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">Deputy Michael D. Higgins queried the use of the words "constitutional treaty" in conjunction with one another. I was one of those who wished to make it clear this was in a stand-alone category. Deputy Higgins is a scholar in this area, but I draw his attention to another scholar, Professor Weir, who said that a constitution is "a treaty by a people to themselves". It is, therefore, apposite to use the two words together.</p>

          <p eId="para_856">Like the Minister, I welcome the enhanced role the national parliaments have been able to play as a result of the Convention's work. I have no doubt these important proposals will be accepted by the Intergovernmental Conference. We know that citizens sometimes perceive a distance between them and Europe. Deputy Boyle rightly said there is a gulf which must be bridged. Involving the national parliaments to a greater degree than ever before in an instructive manner is a valuable step towards bridging that gap. Deputy Boyle also rightly said that the Convention process was much more open than anything that went before and, therefore, the documents emanating from it reflect a political view.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">The Convention also did valuable work in ensuring that agreement can be reached, including the charter of fundamental rights in the new treaty. The work done on the charter, by Ireland in particular, made it possible to include it. The additional articles, from Article 51 onwards in Part II of the treaty dealing with the charter, were the result of work initiated by Ireland. In this regard, Mr. McDonagh made a considerable contribution. Ireland and the United Kingdom forged those articles which allowed the charter to be included. They will ensure it does not do violence to constitutional traditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">The Government has always supported the charter as a clear description of the rights citizens enjoy in their dealings with the institutions of the Union and their governments, in so far as they are implementing European law. However, taking a political declaration and giving it legal effect is not an exercise to be undertaken without careful scrutiny and detailed consideration. We took the most positive approach possible in this regard and did so from a position of strength. We have a strong written Constitution and have some expertise in this matter. We were listened to.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">For the charter to be included, all concerned – citizens, institutions and governments – must be clear and certain as to its scope and the level of its application. The impression should not be given that it did more or less than it does. The Convention did particularly significant work in advancing this aim, making judicious amendments where necessary and showing that in the interpretation of the charter, the courts will have regard to the explanations accompanying its promulgation.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Overall, the new document will give a simple and clear statement of what the Union is and does. I have no difficulty in calling it a constitution or, more appropriately, a constitutional treaty. Many kinds of organisations have constitutions which set out their basic rules and purposes. It should be clear that the constitution will be established by a treaty between member states, all of which must agree and then ratify individually according to their constitutional provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">It is also proposed that the constitutional treaty can only be amended in future by the unanimous agreement of the member states and by subsequent ratification. The fears that have been raised in this regard are false. This is not a supranational state with a constitution that will supersede Bunreacht na hÉireann. As citizens, we will be in a formidable position. As far as Europe is concerned, bunreacht na hEorpa will protect us, but Bunreacht na hÉireann will protect in so far as we are citizens of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">It is important that the Union has the right values and objectives. It is also important it has the right policies and decision-making procedures. It will also need a set of institutions properly equipped to drive it forward. In many ways the Convention was a dry run for enlargement. All of the countries wanting to join the Union participated fully. I disagree with Deputy Boyle in this regard. I sat around the table with the representatives of all the accession states last Monday and Tuesday as an equal, not as a superior.</p>

          <p eId="para_864">If anybody says the contrary was the case, he or she is wrong. All the countries waiting to join the Union participated fully. This brought a new and positive dynamic to our work. However, it also highlighted the difference between having 15 people sitting around a table and 25 or more. Meetings will take longer as there are points of view that must be heard. We need to be sure that the Union's institutions are fully prepared for the new reality. That is why there was such a degree of interest in the institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">The Convention has recommended the creation of a new post of president of the European Council. Some are wary of the idea while others wish to give this office an ambitious and wide-ranging remit. What has emerged from the Convention strikes the right balance and addresses the concerns touched on, for example, by Deputy Gay Mitchell. The president of the European Council will be of assistance to prime ministers in chairing their meetings and following their work. He or she will help to prepare meetings and will facilitate coherence and consensus. Where appropriate, the president will represent the Union internationally in this work. The office will not be in competition with the President of the Commission, nor will the president of the European Council be directing the work of the Council in its different formations. The office will not have a superior role over the other formations of the Council. As long as the Convention's balance is maintained by the Intergovernmental Conference, I regard the creation of the new post as positive and helpful. As the Minister put it, this office will be one of chairperson, not chieftain.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">Similarly, we would all wish to see the Union operating to its fullest potential as the force for good in the world. At present, the Union has two external representatives, one in the Commission's area of competence, currently held by Commissioner Patten, while the other is in the area of the Council's responsibility, where Javier Solana fulfils the role. Both of these are widely acknowledged as having done an excellent job. Not unreasonably, it was felt by many that drawing the two roles together would lead to greater consistency in our approach and to better protection of the Union's voice on the world stage. The Convention has, therefore, proposed the creation of a Union Foreign Minister. Naturally there are detailed issues to be considered and a number of Deputies referred to this aspect. They will have to be pursued in the Intergovernmental Conference where clarity will be sought.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">With regard to the Commission, the Treaty of Nice represented a particularly good deal for small and medium sized member states. For the first time, the full equality of all member states as regards membership was established. The Government went to the Convention determined to protect that vital principle, as did all of the other members of the Irish Convention team. We worked hard with like minded partners and against strong opposition. I believe we succeeded. The text is a success in this regard. However, it can be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The Convention proposes that there be 15 voting Commissioners, including the president and Foreign Minister, with guaranteed equality among member states as regards rotation into and out of the 15 slots. According to the Convention proposals, there will be non-voting Commissioners from those countries without a voting Commissioner for a given period. In other words, there would be representation at the table. This set of proposals is now the subject of lively debate, which I welcome. The Minister summarised the point it has reached. This is work in progress, it is not final.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Other proposals are being made at the Intergovernmental Conference. For example, a considerable number of member states, including all of the accession states, wish to revise the Convention proposals. Most are seeking one voting Commissioner per member state. The Commission has brought forward an excellent paper which suggests a way of achieving this. While we are, broadly speaking, happy with the Convention agreement, subject to some elaboration of the text, we would see real attractions in having a full Commissioner per member state. However, we would only seek it on the basis of exact equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">Similarly, if the Convention agreements are to stand, there are aspects that need to be teased out. We have always said there is room for significant improvement in a number of areas in the text. Like almost all of our partners, we do not support the idea that each country must put forward three candidates, leaving the President of the Commission to make the final choice as to who is the Commissioner. That is not acceptable to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">Likewise, we are anxious about the appointment arrangements for voting and non-voting commissioners and our views are widely shared. The Government strongly wishes that non-voting commissioners should have a significant role and most partners support them having distinct and substantive areas of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">The Italian Presidency has made no secret that it strongly wishes that the Intergovernmental Conference should conclude its work in December and we fully support that. However, if this is not achieved, the task will fall to us. The Minister set out the Government's priorities and the broad approach it is taking. We will press our interests and priorities with conviction. Similarly, other member states are pursuing their concerns with vigour. We all must guard against treating the Intergovernmental Conference as a football match. There can only be winners and losers in football and if one team succeeds, another must fail. That is not how the European Union works. We will pursue issues of concern but, with 25 members sitting around the table, we must be mindful of the need to achieve an outcome with which everybody can live. That takes compromise and everybody must leave the table satisfied. It is not a zero sum game.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">If our work is to be completed as quickly as possible, as we undertook to do at Thessalonika, we will need to take a Community-minded approach. As committed members of the Union, we have a strong and shared interest in an institution that is effective, efficient and continues to deliver benefit to its citizens. Throughout the proceedings of the Convention, I greatly valued and enjoyed the debates with colleagues, particularly at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, which has taken such a close and informed interest in the process. Members have been kept better and more closely informed throughout the Convention than the members of other parliaments in Europe. That is my ambition and that is how we will continue until the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference. I am sorry I do not have time to respond to individual points but if Members wish to pursue particular issues, I am at their disposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_877">Every voter must decide whether he or she wants protest or policy, speeches or decisions or a so-called "unswerving stand" against the law or a firm stand in favour of the law. Most want the country to be governed well. They want holders of public office to adopt realistic policies which they expect to be implemented. They accept the rule of law and want it applied to everyone. However, the motion opposes what most demand and expect because it is not about governance, policies or the law. Instead, it invites the House to commend high and mighty moralising and low down, unlawful actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">The issue has revealed a weak kneed attitude on the part of the Labour Party to anti-democratic protests from the hard left. The Labour Party wants the Government to cave in to this dirty protest. What sort of backbone is that? The party wants the Government to undermine the councillors, management and staff of local authorities by rescinding orders in order that bins that have not been paid for will not be collected. It does not want to appear offside on the left wing of the pitch. It is afraid of what might happen in the local elections.</p>

          <p eId="para_880">The Labour Party would reward unofficial pickets that prevent council workers doing their jobs, a Member for defying the court and agitators who are preventing the collection of bins belonging to law abiding individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The people will reward backbone. It is time for politicians and others to stand up and be counted.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The people I represent in Galway and those in every other area in Ireland would be furious if the Government caved in on this issue. Is this the thanks we get for paying charges and reducing waste? Are we to subsidise a small group in Dublin who refuse to pay and prevent the collection of bins?</p>
          <p eId="para_883">The issue has also lifted the lid on murky tax thinking in our largest trade union. A SIPTU spokesman stated earlier people should pay higher income taxes in order that services could be supplied "free". Going down this road would lead to disaster for workers and the economy. The SIPTU spokesman's proposal would mean a return to the worker's paradise of high tax, high unemployment and high emigration. It would put in danger everything that has been achieved through low taxes on employment.</p>

          <p eId="para_885">The message to workers is, "You can pay more tax and lose your job, but at least the bins will be free."</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The House should not support this nonsense. Let us stand up for ourselves. We would make fools of ourselves to commend one among us who breaks laws passed by the House and defies our courts. We should no more commend a Member for defying court orders than a soccer team should commend its full back for scoring an own goal. Our votes are cast, our laws are made and our courts operate democratically. Every public representative with an ounce of responsibility and a gramme of sense will uphold the law. Sadly, a number of Members have become weightless and witless by inflating their own importance above the law. Most Members and the vast majority of the public have no truck with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Most pay waste charges. In most counties in Ireland and most countries in Europe householders have been paying for public and private collection of waste for years. No one likes paying charges but who ever likes paying bills? We pay for buses, television, electricity and gas. Waste disposal is essential, not optional, according to objectors. However, that is also the case with electricity and transport. We all pay for services and, at the same time, exempt or help the less well-off to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">Through the Department of Social and Family Affairs, we provide support by expending €175 million on free travel, a fuel allowance, an electricity allowance, a free television licence, a telephone allowance, a national gas allowance and a bottled gas allowance. In addition, there are, rightly, waivers for bin charges. Most are responsible and know that paying for waste disposal is a key part of dealing with our waste problem. They are also aware that it is part of a package of policies to tackle waste and that we will protect the environment with policies, not protests.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelGrealishPD" eId="spk_447">
          <from>Mr. Grealish</from>
          <p eId="para_890">For example, in my own city of Galway, we have made tremendous progress in recycling, while at the same time people pay a bin charge of €320. A total of 50% of waste has been diverted from landfill sites. I congratulate Galway City Council and Galway County Council for the lead they have given and the practical solutions they are putting in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">I favour the move towards payment for waste by weight, as is the case in Cork. It will encourage waste minimisation and recycling but, if waste disposal was free and unlimited, it would do nothing to encourage minimisation and recycling. People throughout Ireland are not amused or inspired by protestors in Dublin refusing to pay bin charges. Instead, they are baffled and annoyed. We, in provincial Ireland, are often accused of being parochial. However, in this case, Dublin bin protestors and their leaders are being parochial and small-minded. While we are cleaning up Galway, they have embarked on a dirty protest. While we are recycling 50% of our waste, they are leaving rubbish on the street. While we are protecting Ireland's environment, they are defying Ireland's democracy. It is farcical that a number of those protesting and blocking depots qualify for waivers and, therefore, do not have to pay bin charges. This is sharp practice and brings their credibility to a new low. One might understand a citizen protesting against a charge levied directly against him or her but he or she is physically blocking services and demonstrating on the streets against something that has no impact on him or her, financially or otherwise. This is stubborn arrogance backed up by hypocrisy.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">Anti-bin tax campaigners are also calling to the homes of bin truck drivers and refuse collectors. This is a sinister development and smacks of intimidation. The House should give no comfort to the Dublin protestors. We would do well to stay true to the mandate of a law abiding democracy given by the vast majority of the electorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">With regard to other matters mentioned in the motion, my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, set out last night the full facts about the Government's record on community employment and a fair tax system. The motion invites us to forget recent economic progress and how we built up the massive additional public resources generated from our low tax, pro-enterprise, high employment economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Under the fair and radically reformed tax system, the more money one earns, the more tax one pays – that is how it should be. I am confident that we will continue to build our health, education and social services with the resources generated in this country by enterprise initiative. If actions are taken that slow down the engine of wealth, our power to reduce poverty and inequality will also stall. Every possible indicator and international comparison shows that we have hit the right formula in Ireland in recent years. We have the lowest rate of tax on ordinary workers, the lowest unemployment rate and the highest level of growth. Let us not relinquish these gains to humour one Deputy and let us not join a weak-kneed cave-in from the left wing of Irish politics.</p>

          <from>Mr. Carty</from>
          <p eId="para_895">The 2003 budget for community employment schemes is €274 million. This will provide for an average participation rate of 22,500 and a year end figure of 20,000. Funding of €45 million has been provided for the job initiative scheme in 2003. This will provide for an average participation rate of 2,446 and a year end participation rate of 2,200. A number of participants in the JI scheme, which was designed as a three-year programme, continue to find it difficult to progress from the programme to employment. A review of active labour market programmes is being undertaken by the standing committee on the labour market. Consideration is being given, in the context of this review, to addressing the needs of a number of JI participants who are unlikely to find employment. New supports are being provided. I have spoken to the Taoiseach and several Ministers about this matter and I am hopeful that my concerns will be addressed. Wholesale cuts in CE and JI schemes in deprived areas can only lead to increased feelings of marginalisation. As a Government party, Fianna Fáil has a responsibility to address such issues in a compassionate manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_899">I would not like to be on the Deputy's side.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">It is my view that such cuts will not benefit the wider community. Many of the participants in these schemes will find it difficult to find jobs, while the State will not benefit greatly from the cutting back of vital services. Estimates show that keeping a CE post costs the State just 10% more than allowing the person to return to the dole. This small saving to the State contrasts with the enormous social cost of cutting the schemes, which have an immeasurable value for participants. Tremendous work has been done under CE schemes in County Mayo. Entire villages have been enhanced by the construction of stone walls, the planting of flower beds and the renovation of old buildings, among other things. The participants have great pride in their work and their skills have been put on show. These positions are providing an alternative to life on the dole for many people throughout the country. As well as providing important services, the schemes also give people a sense of purpose and belonging. The benefits of these schemes far outweigh any small cost savings for the State brought about by their abolition.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnCreganFF" eId="spk_453">
          <from>Mr. Cregan</from>
          <p eId="para_901">I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate. CE schemes have become quite topical in recent months, for the right reasons. I acknowledge the contribution of the schemes to the reduction of long-term unemployment in recent years. I agree that the primary purpose of CE schemes is as a transitional labour market programme to provide work experience and training for the long-term unemployed, with a view to reintegrating them into the open labour market. Participation levels have been gradually reduced in accordance with the Government's 1997 decision to restructure community employment schemes. This reduction reflects the significant decrease in the number of long-term unemployed persons and the shift in emphasis from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The programme's average participation rate in 2003 is about 22,500 participants, but it is intended to reduce this number to 20,000 by the end of the year. This constitutes a phased reduction of 5,000 places over the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">I first became interested in CE schemes mainly because I saw the benefit of employing personal assistants for persons with disabilities. A person with a disability who has a PA available to him or her will benefit from the trusting relationship he or she builds with the assistant. I feel strongly that this bond should not be broken after three years but that is happening, unfortunately. I am glad that the Government has decided, following a review of the scheme, that PAs will continue to be employed through CE schemes in future. All CE projects relating to the health service have been ring-fenced to protect them from the reduction of the CE programme to 20,000 places. When CE places were reduced in 2002 from 38,809 to 25,000, FÁS ensured that the designated health sector CE places were maintained, as agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">We must prioritise when we reduce the number of places on a scheme and I think we are getting our priorities right. I fully commend the participants on the scheme who have maintained cemeteries and GAA and soccer grounds and built stone walls, as they have made a major contribution to society. At a time when 40,000 work permits are being issued, we have to be sensible enough to say that able-bodied young people should participate in the work place, as they are employable. I firmly believe that participants in CE schemes who are over the age of 50 or 55, or who have disabilities, should be prioritised. We have to ensure that such people can continue to participate in CE schemes. They should not be given three-year contracts, but instead offered permanent or renewable contracts. We should ensure that people between the ages of 50 or 55 and 65 can make a valuable contribution to society and to their communities. The Government should look after such people by giving them the dignity of employment. I am glad to note that the review's findings seem to suggest that the Government will look after such people. It is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">I recently encountered a 60 year old gentleman who left a CE scheme last May, having finished his three years. He has been on unemployment benefit since last May and he has tried might and main to get a job since then. He has no hope of being employed. I encourage the Minister and the Government to look after him and his ilk, who are making a valuable contribution, particularly in health-related schemes. I refer to personal assistants to people with disabilities, people working in respite care centres and people working in day care centres, all of whom should remain on CE schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">I am sensible enough to admit that the previous level of CE scheme places could not be maintained. CE schemes were initiated at a time when we had a serious unemployment problem in this country. That is no longer the case, thankfully, as a result of good Government policy. We are at a stage when we must prioritise. I appeal once more to the Government to prioritise in the right way, particularly by giving priority to those working on health sector CE schemes and others who have made a valuable contribution. I look forward to the completion of the review. I trust the Minister and the Government to ensure that when the review is completed, those over the age of 55 and persons with disabilities will continue to be employed. Such people are making a huge contribution on schemes at present.</p>

          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_909">The motion moved by Deputy Gregory last night refers to Deputy Joe Higgins's "unswerving stand in the pursuit of equity in Irish society". When I listen to him in the Chamber, I frequently find it difficult to judge whether Deputy Higgins's contributions reflect such a stand or are merely colourful rants of old-fashioned eastern European socialist gobbledygook. However, I have no difficulty in assessing his position on the issue of refuse collection charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">No element of current taxation in the State provides for refuse collection. Much less is there provision in the income tax code for any such charge. As the Tánaiste pointed out last night, the tax burden on low income workers is the lowest in the European Union. While it remains so, we will maintain our competitive advantage over our rivals, particularly in the area of job creation and attracting inward investment, and will be in a far better position to protect employment. If we were to adopt the taxation model favoured by Deputy Higgins, we would drive jobs out of the country. We had that difficulty for long enough and must ensure we do not return to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">The final element of the Opposition motion refers to inequitable stealth taxes. There are no stealth taxes in the State. Each and every tax or charge is introduced publicly and transparently, whether by vote of Parliament in a budget or Finance Act, ministerial order or a local authority or other agency. No one can point to a charge which has not been introduced in accordance with the correct legal procedures. Our taxes are legal, open and visible. They are not stealth taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">Refuse collection charges can be waived for low income families and other provisions facilitate the use of weekly stickers or bags. Similar schemes apply to a range of other charges across several Departments and agencies. We must examine the alternatives to such charges. The one frequently urged on the Minister for Finance is an increase in taxation on employment. Such an increase would drive low paid workers back into the ranks of the unemployed. The close connection between unemployment and poverty is well documented in many reports and studies. The State finances would suffer the double blow of lost income tax and increased unemployment benefit payments. We must take care not to support failed economic models. I am in no hurry to pursue Deputy Higgins down the road of transforming the country into another Albania, Romania or Bulgaria.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">The remaining elements of the motion refer to the various community employment type schemes sponsored by FÁS. The schemes were introduced as labour market measures when the rate of unemployment stood at 17%. It is now around 4%. It is clear that the focus of the schemes must be altered to take account of changed circumstances. Some worthwhile work has been done by participants and a substantial number have managed to move on to full-time employment. This year's allocation is €274 million and the schemes provide more than 20,000 places. While the motion criticises the Government, it does not advance any constructive proposals for the future development of the schemes. In the context of the changes that have taken place, there is no doubt that they need to be modernised. There are lessons to be learned. Some were pointed out by speakers last evening and others were pointed out this evening by speakers on this side of the House. Changes are required to and we must look carefully at how we can improve the schemes and ensure their valuable work continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">I commend the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, for the tremendous work he has done in his Department in devising new models. That is the challenge which faces us.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_459">
          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_916">The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for a review and reappraisal of the schemes. Besides the internal review being conducted by FÁS, further work is being done under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">A minority of participants in job initiative schemes have had difficulty in progressing to employment. There is a view that some participants at that level may never be able to make the move into full-time ordinary employment. There is a clear need for their future to be charted and set out. I commend the Minister of State for facing up to this. Deputy Cregan referred to people of 55 or 60 years of age who have participated in schemes for three years. If such people are living in rural areas, they are likely to have difficulty in finding employment opportunities. Some of them have wonderful skills and do invaluable work around villages, in graveyards and so forth which adds considerably to the quality of life in rural areas. I understand the Minister of State proposes to make provision to allow a substantial number to continue to participate in schemes for quite a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">One of the elements which needs to be looked at in this area is an audit of skills and experience available in various communities among those who continue to be unemployed. That is a difficult task but I understand it is being done. We must also take account of the fact that many of that age group who finish their participation in schemes return to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance at a considerable cost to the State. I suspect that officials in the Department of Finance would argue that the difference between maintaining someone on unemployment assistance and having them participate in a scheme is substantial. Even so, the value of the work being undertaken should be taken into account. Any reasonable and reasoned appraisal would take account of such value and find that the benefit of continued participation in schemes far outweighs the alternative which faces so many participants. I hope the Minister of State will be successful in persuading other Departments to support his ideas for this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">Many community employment scheme jobs have been mainstreamed. In some cases this has been reasonably successful but in others the experience has been negative. Mainstreaming in the health service has been attempted and, in some cases, has been found to be possible but considerable problems have been thrown up. I accept that personal assistants build up a relationship with an individual and become hugely important in that person's life and that the lack of continuity under the banner of FÁS did enormous damage. Nevertheless, mainstreaming has not always addressed the difficulties of continuity seen under FÁS.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">This area is the responsibility of the health service but one where considerable advances have been made, almost all of which are due to the success of individual programmes introduced by FÁS with bodies such as the Irish Wheelchair Association. Some of the success in this area has been lost in the transfer to the Department of Health and Children and, in the case of schools, the Department of Education and Science. It is a pity that has been the case but the problem can be successfully addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">There is no doubt that considerable work, including voluntary work, remains to be done in and around local communities and schools and in the area of health. It can continue to be done usefully by these people. It is a matter of urgency that the Government implements a scheme that effectively develops the current community employment schemes in a meaningful way.</p>

          <p eId="para_922">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has a very valid point when she tells us that the fall in unemployment should naturally necessitate a review of community employment schemes. We have to take account of the fall in long-term unemployment, from 5.6% in 1997 to under 2% today. This represents a drop from 90,000 to less than 30,000. It is only natural to revise and re-evaluate a scheme that harks back to the days when we had an unemployment level of 17%.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">The motion tabled by the Technical Group seems to be rooted in what one can only term an outdated ideology that holds that in order to improve people's welfare, someone has to suffer or be penalised. This is a pernicious and dangerous philosophy. The Government has shown that by providing incentives and encouragement, we can raise everybody's status. In a newspaper today, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer – hardly a man at the forefront of right-wing politics – cautioned against forgetting that to abolish poverty we must create wealth. The Government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary investment it made in social inclusion and I am happy to support its amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_926">Deputy Joe Higgins should not be in prison, nor should his councillor colleague or the 13 other protesters. The Labour Party does not support the tactics which have been adopted by anti-bin charge campaigners, who have blocked bin lorries and blockaded council depots, thus depriving the people of this city of a refuse collection service for the past two days. Moreover, we do not support or condone their refusal to abide by orders of the court. We support the right of people to protest, but such protests must be within the law and, as a matter of good campaigning strategy, they should avoid disruption of public services and the consequent alienation of public support.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">However, the continued imprisonment of the protesters does not guarantee an uninterrupted public service, nor does it necessarily add to respect for the law. As we have seen over the past two days, and over the past month in some parts of Dublin, the imprisonment of the protesters has led to an escalation of the protests and to the denial of the bin collection service in Dublin to householders to a far greater extent than would ever have been achieved by the Minister's order or by the county managers.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">While I understand the difficulty presented to the courts by protesters who refuse to comply with court orders and while I respect the independent right of the courts to apply the law, I have to question if the continued imprisonment of protesters does not ultimately lead to a reduction in public respect for the rule of law.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">Many law-abiding citizens, including some who agree with the bin charges, wonder why scarce prison places should be used to hold bin protesters rather than drug pushers, joyriders and other anti-social elements who inflict real criminal harm on local communities, not to mention some of the high-rolling tax evaders who have never been sent to prison or those responsible for the large-scale illegal dumping of waste in County Wicklow and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">The people of Dublin have, for the past two days, been denied the waste collection service for which most have paid. They are now caught between two sets of protagonists, both of which are wrong in their approach to this issue. On the one hand, extreme protesters are blockading council depots and preventing bin collections. It is ironic that a protest which started out to ensure that every household's bin was collected has directly caused everybody's bin not to be collected. There is no mandate for the blockading of council depots and it should stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">On the other hand, the order the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has given to council managers not to collect bins from charge defaulters has triggered these protests. There was no need for the order and, as the Labour Party predicted, it has led to conflict and health and environmental hazards from uncollected waste. Local authorities already had the power to take court action against defaulters.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The Labour Party believes that in order for normal refuse services to be restored, the organisers of the protests should call off the blockading of council depots and the Minister should suspend his no collection order. Failure to do this will lead to increased conflict, continued disruption of the service and possible further imprisonment of protesters. This problem cannot be resolved by continuing resort to the Garda and the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">At the beginning of these protests I called on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to intervene. His failure to do so to date has contributed to the worsening of the problem, as has his tough-talking stance. Neither grandstanding by some protest leaders or tough talk from a Minister who wants to prove his political manhood on this issue will help resolve the problem for Dublin's householders.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">Real leadership is now required and the Labour Party is proposing a way forward on the bin charge row. A number of steps should be taken. The blockades should be called off. No protest group has the right to decide unilaterally that an essential public service should be denied to the public. If this were an industrial dispute, for example, the workers would have had to be balloted, industrial relations procedures exhausted and notice given of strike action. In this case, neither refuse collectors nor householders have been asked whether the service should be withdrawn. Moreover, this tactic has deflected attention from the core issue of waste management and bin charges and has allowed the Minister to masquerade as a champion of the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">The Minister should suspend the no collection order. There was no need for it in the first place. As the Minister has said repeatedly, most were paying their charges. Every local authority has a charge, and local authorities had a number of sanctions available to them to encourage defaulters to pay up. The order to deny collection has led to conflict, but it would have led to serious health and environmental problems in any case. If waste is left uncollected for some weeks in back gardens – even in a small number of houses in a neighbourhood – it will cause obvious problems for all who live there, including those who have paid their charges. If the no collection order is suspended and the blockades are called off, local authorities should return to the High Court and apply for the release of the protesters who have been imprisoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">The refuse charges system should be changed by relating all charges to the volume of waste presented by the householder. In my council of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, for example, no distinction is made between an elderly householder living alone, who generates very little waste, and a large household that produces a lot of waste. Both are charged €275. The levels of charges should be banded to reflect ability to pay. The present charging system is unfair to low-income families. Increases in charges should be capped and limited to the consumer price index. It is clear that the Minister intends that the charges should be increased. This is one of the major fears many have about charges, and it is well-founded. County managers, seeking the finance with which to meet benchmarking commitments, will be tempted to raise the charge in forthcoming estimates and, in any event, section 43 of the so-called Protection of the Environment Act, introduced by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, earlier this year, provides that local authorities and the operators of waste collection facilities will be statutorily required to increase the charge to the economic cost of providing the land, operating the facility and carrying out the subsequent clean-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">The power to make charges should be restored to the elected members of local authorities. It was undemocratic to give these powers to un-elected county managers and, in any event, unnecessary given that every local authority, regardless of its difficulties, had managed to adopt a charge. A national waiver scheme should be introduced which would apply to private and public collection services. Currently, no waiver scheme operates for private collections.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">The Labour Party calls for this way forward because the current conflict will not lead to an efficient service for the public or a reform of the refuse charges, but to continued disruption of the public bin collection service and, possibly, its ultimate privatisation. Such an outcome would not be in the interests of householders, council employees or the environment. Common sense must now be applied to this issue and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should show the kind of leadership set out in the Labour Party's proposals. The Labour Party will support the motion expressing regret at the imprisonment of Deputy Joe Higgins and condemning the Government for its lack of fairness and equity in its social policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">I wish to address the Government's response to the motion. It was interesting that the only two Government speakers who presented yesterday evening were the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who were joined this evening by Deputy Grealish, also a member of the Progressive Democrats Party.</p>

          <p eId="para_941">I am aware that Deputies Batt O'Keeffe and Killeen, both of whom I respect, spoke this evening. On this issue the Progressive Democrats Party appears at last to have found the voice it had apparently lost during the past 15 months in Government. Deputy Grealish and the Tánaiste, in particular, were concerned about people breaking the law. It is, therefore, a surprise that they did not seek the advice of their colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, or explain to the House the reason it was acceptable for him, in a previous incarnation, to support a blockade of meat plants, for which nobody was arrested, charged or imprisoned, while it is not acceptable to blockade council depots. Perhaps they will explain the reason it was acceptable to refuse access to land to roads engineers and subsequently negotiate a large compensation settlement for the group in question. If we need political proof that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor, the contributions made on this motion by representatives of the Progressive Democrats Party are ample evidence.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_942">I support the motion tabled by the Technical Group. It should never have reached the point at which Deputy Joe Higgins and others find themselves in jail. They should not be in prison because their imprisonment came about as a result of the transfer of authority from elected representatives nationally and locally to un-elected members of local authorities, who have taken a decision without having to take into account the consequences of taking this matter to the courts for a ruling. This has been an unfortunate chain of events, from which we should learn that every time this House cedes authority, it also cedes the capacity to deal with the consequences of actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">What is the background to the public reaction to these events? A man from Sligo wrote to me with 2,200 signatures he had gathered on the streets objecting to the jailing of Deputy Joe Higgins. The perception is that people who take a particular view of society – they disagree with me on many matters but agree with me on many more – now find themselves in jail when many others who have ransacked this county's wealth are flaunting it.</p>

          <p eId="para_945">The speech in which my Galway West colleague, Deputy Grealish, described his version of society would have done justice to the latter days of Franco's regime in Spain. What is so admirable about a society in which one can be non-resident for the purpose of paying one's taxes, but perfectly free to bid for assets of the State built up with public money?</p>
          <p eId="para_946">The Deputy's party stands for greed. He has a neck to use the word "hypocrisy" in light of his statement to the people of Galway that he opposed incineration and the solemn declaration he gave in my presence at another meeting that he was in favour of rights-based legislation on disability. This was his position until he came to Dublin when he adopted the attitude that he was only one of a small group. He has discovered his voice and, to borrow his words, the people are waiting to give their opinion on him and his ilk next June.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">The Tánaiste's speech last night perpetuated an outrageous version of this country. The reality is we had an enormous boom which was squandered. Documents such as Achieving Inclusion by CORI show that every one of the previous budgets resulted in a massive transfer to those who were wealthy and could, for example, afford to save the maximum amount in an SSIA. The CORI publication describes statistically the groups to which the transfers have been made and shows that the people on the lowest incomes benefited least from recent budgets, while those on the highest income benefited most. This is the reason the motion is correct to include the word "equity".</p>
          <p eId="para_948">Perhaps we have all been too polite in putting up with the spokespersons for the housing speculators who have made it impossible for people to put a roof over their head. Members of the Progressive Democrats Party who gave us lectures on productivity for benchmarking could improve their performance by turning up in the House or doing a little work on committees. They represent the speculating class, many of whom, in any advanced society, would be in jail for what they have brought about.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">In the city in which Deputy Grealish and I live, 80% of those on the housing list would not qualify for affordable housing because they are on social welfare. Is it right to take lectures on how we should respect the law from people such as the Deputy? While the law must be respected, it must also be based on justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">This House established a tribunal chaired by Mr. Justice Morris, who has taken it upon himself, in his appeal to the Supreme Court, to state that the law must be seen to apply to everybody, including Members of the Oireachtas, as if any Member of the Oireachtas had sought to put himself or herself outside the remit of the tribunal Mr. Justice Morris chairs. He then stated it was heinous to suggest that the Garda Síochána was guilty of something without giving one's source. Would it not be more heinous if gardaí did what has been alleged or if a person who was aware of what they did remained silent and failed to communicate this knowledge to anybody? It is time Mr. Justice Morris reflected before issuing press releases on the basis of his appeal and time Members began to speak with greater directness.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The motion is correct to use the word "equity". We regularly hear those who care for the elderly, provide a home help service, help people with a handicap or sit alongside lonely people in our communities described by the Tánaiste as not having real jobs in the real economy. Her worry is that one will not be able to drive people into the real economy, which is the reason she suggested we should all have to work beyond the age of 65 years. She stated we would have to consider keeping the elderly at work because the economy required it. The philosophy of the Progressive Democrats Party is "Live and die for the economy", an economy based on individual greed.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">I defy the Progressive Democrats Party to disprove an interesting statistic on our position in the European Union for spending on social protection. According to EU figures, we spend least of the member states. It is interesting that Sweden spends 32.9% of gross domestic product on social protection, which includes items such as child care, housing, access to public parks and so forth. The equivalent figure for Ireland is 14.7% and the gap is widening.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">When these people look at a country like Sweden, where there are high taxes to pay for good social protection and a civilised society built on principles of equity, it becomes a misery index. All the money one earns, according to the Progressive Democrats philosophy, is one's own and one should not spend a penny on solidarity. That is the party that would lecture us on the inappropriateness of one of our Members being in prison, other people being in prison and the absence of a waste management strategy even though it delegates powers to people who are not accountable. That is what this is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">It is interesting to see what has happened across every social indicator while our great economic miracle took place. I have heard from every Member of the Progressive Democrats that one must create wealth to reduce poverty. However, the figures show that the gaps in society have widened. Compare the chances of education for any child living in a city council house in Dublin, for example, with those of our children. Compare the chances of somebody who is dependent on the health services with those who can top up their contributions to private health.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">I wonder at the neck of these people. I hope when they go to the doors throughout Ireland that people will take a good hard look at them and tell the Tánaiste, who asked them to live and die for the economy, what they think of how she squandered the surpluses by giving money to the rich. She refused to tax speculators and allowed immunity for non-residents. In addition, she took €1 billion and gave it, through transfer systems and the social saving scheme, to people who have the capacity to fork €250 and more per month into their savings. They will now get even more. Is it not great that the Government is giving it to them?</p>
          <p eId="para_956">This is interesting for somebody who once served in Government with the Fianna Fáil Party. That party has been taken over by these apostles of greed and their notions of the economy. They are the people who will now turn to somebody who was relying on a person to visit them, not to physically help them but to listen and talk to them and reduce their loneliness, and tell them it is not a real job. The same will apply to a person who needs assistance with meals or who is organising a scheme for young people addicted to drugs or for former prisoners. Those are the 10,000 jobs that are affected – 5,000 in one batch while there are 2,500 each in the other two batches. What are those communities being told? They are told that when the great Progressive Democrats wagon rolls in and they have all gobbled at the trough, there will be something there for the people who have been left behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">I take no lectures from Deputy Grealish and that little, miserable, individualist bloc in the Progressive Democrats or from the party they have contaminated, Fianna Fáil.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_469">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_958">I wish to share time with Deputy Gogarty. I welcome the opportunity to speak in favour of the motion before the House. I visited Deputy Joe Higgins in Mountjoy. He is a champion of the most deprived in our society and has fought valiantly for greater equity. However, I made the point during my visit that I disagree with his stance on the bin charge. A protest should affect the people against whom one is protesting, not innocent bystanders. In the current protest there has been too much collateral damage, to use the terrible euphemism of the US military. Non-collection of bins can be a negative experience for people with large families and for older people. In view of the number of phone calls I have received, I believe it has not left people well disposed towards the protest or the protesters.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">I believe in the polluter pays principle. The tax should be fair and we should know how the tax will be used. It should be used exclusively for environmental purposes. The flat rate is unfair. It does not encourage more recycling. What we call the PAYT – pay as you throw – is better. In other words, it should be a volume or weight-related tax. That encourages people to recycle and punishes the polluter or the waster. Thus far, the only response from the Minister has been a token one. This is where Deputy Joe Higgins is correct. He has quoted figures from the EPA which clearly show that in 2001, of the 302,000 tonnes of paper disposed of by households, over 92% went to landfill and only 7.4% was recycled. With regard to commercial waste, and notwithstanding the efforts of Repak which simply gets industry off the hook, 71% went to landfill and only 28% was recycled. The figures for glass are similar. Only 29% of glass from households went for recycling while over 70% went to landfill.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">This situation will continue as it is. The Minister might get the levels increased slightly to reach EU targets but after that incinerators will be in use and the waste will go into them rather than landfill. We will substitute incineration for landfill. That will be our waste management strategy for the next 30 years because that is how long an incinerator will last. The Minister claims the Ringsend incinerator will be perfectly safe and will function well. I do not know how he can give that assurance. The incinerator will be massive at 750,000 tonnes, which will require over 360 journeys a day by trucks trundling through the Ringsend and Sandymount areas. It has to operate for 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 30 years and it has to operate perfectly. I do not believe it can do that and there are good reasons for that belief. The sewage treatment plant in Ringsend is a state-of-the-art plant. We know it is there because we can smell it. The citizens of Ringsend and Sandymount know all about it. The problem is that if the incinerator malfunctions, we will not smell it. We will not know because there will be so many hidden poisons around us.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">I do not trust this Minister, the EPA or the city council to be accountable on this issue. That is the problem. The Minister says he wants to fast track major infrastructural projects. When it was put to him by John Bowman that he might want to fast track incinerators, he was non-committal and typically evasive. Deputy McDowell is my constituency colleague. Will he support the infrastructure Bill if it includes incinerators? This politician and the Progressive Democrats campaigned here and in Galway against incinerators. They have reneged on their promise. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, has not even raised the matter in Cabinet. They can pontificate at length in this House but when it comes to keeping their election promises they are worse than Fianna Fáil. They are the whited sepulchres of Irish politics.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_470">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_962">I wholeheartedly support the motion. I regret the imprisonment of Deputy Joe Higgins and commend him for his unswerving stance on behalf of the less well-off in society. Deputy Joe Higgins deserves full credit. Nobody can say he is not an honest person who is trying to help his constituents and the wider community.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">I disagree with the anti-bin charge campaign and the tactics of the Socialist Party members in providing misleading information about elected representatives to favour their own little election campaigns. They are very much afraid to put themselves forward as Socialist Party candidates. They would rather be insurance candidates or bin tax candidates. That is a mistake on their part, because if the rest of the members of the Socialist Party had the commitment and intellectual capacity of Deputy Higgins, they might go a very long way. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and the cream has very much risen to the top. I regret the fact that Deputy Higgins, Councillor Daly and the others were incarcerated. I do not think breaking the law and being in contempt of court should go unpunished but it sends out the wrong message when others have received far lesser sentences for far greater crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">I also want to say, as Deputy Gormley did, that a fairer system whereby those who recycle are rewarded and those who do not are penalised is the way to go. It is something that the representative for the Environment Commissioner said to me at the National Forum on Europe. A flat tax is the worst option. One is better off having an income tax system than a flat tax but the best option is to allow each household a certain amount free, obviously with waivers for those not in a position to pay and free tags for those who are less well off. However, ultimately it should be based on rewarding those who wish to recycle and making those who throw everything into their bin pay for the privilege of polluting.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">Regarding the rest of the motion, my constituency is shared with the Tánaiste, and it is in north Clondalkin, in particular, that the cutbacks in the job initiative and community employment schemes have hit the hardest. I understand the Tánaiste was due at a meeting organised by Actions Against Cuts in Community Services on Friday. She cancelled that meeting or was not able to attend. As a result, none of the other Deputies was able to go to it. I tabled God knows how many questions about Neilstown, Quarryvale, Rowlagh, Ronanstown and all the areas in north Clondalkin affected by the cuts. The response was that they were not in order, that it was a matter for FÁS. Who the hell passes the buck to FÁS except the Tánaiste? She has the power to say what community employment schemes will be like in the future. She is passing the buck and hiding behind an organisation which clearly does not want to have community employment schemes but in its actions has provided a much needed, even vital community service.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">I will sum up because of the time factor and say I also agree with the motion regarding the effects on those on vocational training schemes such as Youthreach. Last but not least, if there is to be a tax, the Minister should ensure it is equitable and that income tax is shifted towards taxes on the user and polluter where possible and that the poorest of our society are not penalised. We currently have a situation where those at the very top, the tax evaders and tax exiles, are the ones who make the money, while the ordinary PAYE worker has to suffer and struggle on. That is the reason we have the bin charge protest. It is not because of the bin charge itself, because there is a fairer system which the majority favour, but because there is huge anger and outrage about this uncaring and incompetent Government which has been focused on the bin tax issue. The Minister should cop on.</p>

          <p eId="para_967">I send greetings of solidarity to all those incarcerated for non-payment of the waste charge, especially my constituents who have been forced to spend time away from their families, one party colleague and her daughter being in that group. I will concentrate on the ridiculous situation in which the Government is landing many disadvantaged communities, areas such as my own, which the Government has designated RAPID – in need of rapid help. In those very areas where people need the most help and encouragement to rebuild after years of neglect, being disadvantaged and suffering a drugs crisis, they are now being hammered once again. Just as they are starting to get on their feet, the Government has taken the ground from under them.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">I can list many examples of CE schemes, job initiative and social economy programmes which have been decimated because of cutbacks, including theatre workshops in Ballyfermot and two community centres, one of which was just about to be fully opened, but which, despite €7 million being spent on it, cannot open because the CE scheme is about to collapse. Another in the Cherry Orchard area, which is totally dependent on CE workers, also faces closure at night and weekends because it does not have enough staff or any other type of funding on which it might keep open. Those most disadvantaged benefited from the CE and job initiative schemes over the years, including the elderly, youths, the disabled and those most at risk in society – those most in need of our encouragement. However, the Government cut back on the very services and supports on which they are dependent.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">Let us examine the profits of banks in Ireland. If one raised the tax on them by 1%, it would be enough to ensure all those services and CE schemes could remain intact until such time as the Government produced the alternative which it keeps promising. It is cutting back on CE places without any alternative being put in its stead. Perhaps we should have full-time CE schemes. That is fine but the Minister should not close down the schemes until that programme is in place. He should not send the community back to where it was five or ten years ago. We must encourage and invest money in it, and that must be done now. We need the opposite of cutbacks, namely, greater investment.</p>

          <p eId="para_970">Like my colleagues, I too wish to show my solidarity and support for those currently imprisoned for taking a principled position on the bin charges. Last Monday in my constituency office in Tralee two young women – single parents – came to see me. They were distraught because they had just discovered that their rent allowance, as a result of their being involved in a CE scheme, had been cut. The fact of its being cut made it impossible for them to continue with the scheme, meaning that they had to give it up. It is ironic also that just a week before, five women, VTOS participants, came into my office. Having signed a contract a month before, they found out that the child care provisions available to them then had now been cut, again making it impossible for them to continue. The fact that they were tied into a contract created a great deal of unnecessary worry and hardship for them. It is also very important that the two women who came to see me with their children last Monday morning told me that, as a result of their involvement in the scheme, they now had the confidence to stand up.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">I wonder if the fact that those most in need and most deprived gain such confidence is one of the reasons behind the cynical cut implemented by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on those most in need. Is it the fact that the working class – single parents and young people with very little education – are gaining that confidence from their involvement in VTOS and community employment schemes? Are they finding themselves penalised because of that benefit to their being?</p>
          <p eId="para_972">I also find it absolutely disgraceful that, once again last weekend, 5,000 so-called delegates attended a conference in Killarney applauding and supporting the Thatcherite policies of the Government while those most in need in our community were being penalised and deprived. They also applauded the tax concessions given to multinationals to rape our sea beds. They are not present to listen to what I have to say, but I have no doubt that they will appear at 8.30 p.m. to vote in support of those cuts. Next week they will return to their constituencies and whisper to people that they are opposed to them, that they are doing everything possible behind the scenes and that they are having a word in the ear. What does that mean? It means that the elected representatives on the opposite side of the House continue to support these cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">Is it not also a shame that people who are unemployed and trying to obtain meaningful employment by taking advantage of schemes and VTOS courses have found themselves back on the growing list of the unemployed? I have no doubt that next June the people will speak against what has been done to those most in need by this Thatcherite Government and those who keep the ideology of Thatcher alive on the opposite of the House. Those in Fianna Fáil should be ashamed because everything that the party supposedly stood for in the past has fallen by the wayside due to its support for the Progressive Democrats and their Thatcherite policies. The shame is on them.</p>

          <p eId="para_975">Let there be no mistake that the current situation has been brought about directly as a result of the policy of confrontation created by the Government. It has done so through its instruction and empowerment of city and county managers to carry out specific functions at the behest of Ministers. We are faced with a situation where a demand is not being met by a considerable section in the community and city and county managers have been empowered to impose a "no collect" order. That order is extremely discriminatory and runs against the interests of the entire community on the basis of health and all other environmental considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">I will use the time remaining of this opportunity of association with and support for the motion to ask for the no collection clause in the so-called Protection of the Environment Act 2003 to be removed. That is the clause that has given rise to the confrontation and removing it is the only way that a resolution of the current difficulties will be achieved. The clause must be removed, the legislation must be amended.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_977">I wish to discuss the community employment and JI programmes which have made to help reduce long-term unemployment in recent years. The primary purpose of CE is as a transitional labour market programme to provide work experience and training for the long-term unemployed with a view to reintegrating them into the open labour market. In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels have been gradually reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The average participation rate on the programme during 2003 is in the region of 22,500. The allocation of places and renewal of individual CE projects, both in Dublin and throughout the country, is a matter for FÁS.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given priority. CE places in the health sector are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services. However, such places are subject to the normal eligibility requirements for the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">I understand that difficulties are being encountered by certain organisations which have problems in replacing participants due to the lack of suitable applicants coming forward for the programme.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_981">All health service-related CE projects, have been ring-fenced from reductions that have taken place as a result of reducing the CE programme to 20,000 places by the end of 2003. During 2002, when CE places were reduced from 38,809 places to 25,000 places, FÁS ensured that these designated health CE places were untouched and that they were maintained as agreed. The priorities proposed – the retention of community employment places relating to drugs services, affordable child care, health-disability services and the high priority for projects in RAPID neighbourhoods – are being recognised by FÁS in deciding the optimum use for the funds available. Many participants have completed their time in community employment and are ready to move on and a number of others have been offered places on other projects. Funding amounting to €274.3 million is available for the administration of the CE programme on a national basis during 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">The jobs initiative programme is also a work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer. Its fundamental objective is to prepare participants to progress into mainstream jobs. Funding of €45 million was provided for the programme, which provides for an average participation rate of 2,466 and a year end rate of 2,200, in 2003. Overall, there will be a reduction of 325 places during 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">A key indicator of economic performance is labour market change. Employment in the Irish economy actually grew last year by 1.4%. The unemployment situation remains very stable at just 4.4%. A particularly welcome feature of Ireland's labour market performance in recent years is the very low long-term unemployment rate, which fell from 10.4% in 1988 to 5.5% in 1997 and now stands at 1.4%.</p>

          <p eId="para_991">I wish to share time with Deputies Cowley, James Breen and Healy. I commend and thank my fellow Independent Deputies on coming together to work as a team on this important motion, which sets out a clear vision for our society. The latter is the complete opposite of the type of society that the Government is trying to create. It also faces up to the difficult decisions about the distribution of resources and the need to stand up for the elderly, the disabled, working people and the weaker sections of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">Many people are asking why Deputy Joe Higgins, Councillor Clare Daly and other residents are locked up in Mountjoy while criminals and tax dodgers are walking the streets. These are awkward questions for our society and we must wake up to the reality that there is a major erosion of public confidence in the wake of recent scandals. We have seen more of this in recent days with Ministers travelling to play golf in Spain during a working week and Deputies skiving off to Australia during the opening days of this Dáil session. I particularly challenge Deputy Power on this issue. We should not be afraid to say that this is not good practice and it should be exposed. I am not claiming any high moral ground on these issues but when Ministers, judges or politicians engage in behaviour of this nature, their credibility is seriously tainted.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">Last night we listened to a lecture from the Tánaiste on democracy and the left in general. On the issue of democracy, the Tánaiste should take a good look at these benches. In the recent opinion polls, the Technical Group is running at 24%. That figure is six times greater than that attributed to the Progressive Democrats. There is nothing progressive or democratic about the Tánaiste's policies. She has turned her back on the liberal and democratic tradition in this country. If she considers the position of her colleagues, the Liberal Democrats, in England, she will discover how far to the right her party has travelled. The Progressive Democrats supported the war in Iraq where 10,000 civilians lie dead. Now the party is afraid to admit it, but it is conning the people on taxation by saying one thing and introducing stealth taxes by the backdoor.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">The recent One in Four row about giving funding to abuse victims is another classic example. Will the Department come into the real world, stop making a laughing stock of itself and give the One in Four group its €80,000 funding? We are talking about a miserly €80,000 in the context of a deal that will run to hundreds of millions of euro. It is a question of fairness and equity.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">The renewal of child care allowances for participants in VTOS, Youthreach and FÁS training schemes, preventing the most disadvantaged achieving second-chance education, is a disgrace. It is another example of social and community vandalism. The Government is wrecking services and then using taxpayers' money to pick up the tab for the fall-out in the wider community. This motion is about the 26% of lone parents who do not have the ability to adequately heat their homes and are living in poverty. Of these people, who have a gross income of less the €12,000 per annum, 20% have never been in paid employment and 62% left school before completion of the junior certificate. This debate is about siding with these people and taking the tough decisions in their interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">I urge all Deputies in the House to support the motion as it stands and to stop hiding behind amendments. Our people are crying out for vision and leadership on this issue. I call on Deputies to support us.</p>

          <p eId="para_997">Community employment schemes have been a great help to the communities that organised them. It is a shame that they are under threat. I admit to being a sponsor of a community employment scheme in my village where it has been very helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">There is a CE scheme in Mayo run by people with multiple sclerosis. It has been in operation for almost ten years but is due to finish in January. I cannot begin to tell the House how upset the participants are. There are about 16 people involved and I have met most of them. The scheme is a lifeline for them. Virtually all those on the scheme have no chance of a job. It is a terrible tragedy as many of those participants have been laid-off from regular employment due to the onset of their illness. Many are disabled but manage with the support of their fellow participants. They do great work in visiting others suffering from MS in their own homes. They also operate a once-weekly club for MS sufferers with 20 participants and operate a day club from noon until 3 p.m. every Friday. Physiotherapy for MS sufferers in the county is also organised by them. The scheme received support from the Western Health Board last year. No extra funds were available this year so the group had to raise €3,000. Their work is fabulous and caters for all of Mayo. They bring people from Belmullet for physiotherapy and day trips. It is a shame that this scheme is being ended and I wrote to the Minister about it. I hope she will do something about it. She passed it on to Deputy Fahey, but I hope she will look at it again.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">VTOS involves young mothers who are trying to do something to improve their lot in life. They are trying to improve their job prospects. Down payments have been made to crèches by young mothers and they are anxious that they will be allowed to go. If they drop out the numbers will decrease and the scheme may well fall. Mayo VEC has said it will reduce by 37% and so on. I call on the Government to look at this as it involves the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">I agree with the polluter pays principle. No matter who the polluter is, the bigger the polluter, the more they should pay. Big and small business must play their part. Unfortunately, it seems the small man gets the rub most of all. We should have a system that is equitable and transparent and then people would be quite happy to go along with it. Big business can play its part by reducing the amount of waste it produces. Why should those who produce little or no waste have to pay anything at all? If such people did not have to pay it might encourage other people to produce less waste.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_1002">The Minister castigated the lefties and rural Deputies for appending their names to this motion. Is this because she knows that we are the ones who can see what the Government is really doing? She referred to our support for Deputy Joe Higgins. Personally, I will not condone anyone breaking the law. I commend Deputy Higgins for sticking to his principles in this matter. What type of country is this when a man standing up for his constituents is handed down such a severe sentence while criminals roam the streets, receive suspended sentences, rack-up charges and remain outside the walls of Mountjoy Prison and other prisons in this State?</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">I feel the reduction of the number of people on community employment schemes is an attack on the fabric of our society. In rural areas and small towns where there is little or no public transport or employment opportunities created by big business, these schemes provide opportunities for those who were in long-term unemployment to leave the dole queues. CE schemes gave people the opportunity to learn new skills or enhance skills they already had. People were given pride and dignity and were employed by their own communities. What do these people now have to look forward to? Who is going to run the projects these people worked on which are now essential parts of these communities? Who will work in the crèches, carry out the landscaping or take on the handiwork in schools? I ask the Minister to indicate where the saving is to the Exchequer in transferring these people back to the dole queues. Some of these people will never have the opportunity to work again and some will never feel the self-esteem they felt in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">Where are all the promises that were made before the general election to the effect of no cutbacks, secret or otherwise? Do not make me laugh. The slogan for that campaign should have been, "A lot done, a lot more to be undone". I could start about the state of the health service. I could talk about the increase in hospital waiting lists and what the Hanly report has done about this. Deputy Pat Breen brought up the crisis in the orthodontic service yesterday and was ruled out of order. Being ruled out of order does not shorten the waiting list.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">The introduction of a levy on builders to provide services in estates is simply the introduction of another tax that will be responsible for a future hike in house prices. Does this Government realise the pressure on people over property as things stand?</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Where is the Ennis bypass? It was promised at the end of 2002 and then 2003. I now wonder if it will be put back until 2004. The Minister promised sustainable jobs. Where are they? They are not to be found in County Clare where industries are closing down and nothing is being done to replace them. How can the Government hold up its head and say it is looking after the underprivileged when the price of electricity is on the increase and medical bills have also increased? There have been many more increases, but I will not list them because we would be in session for a long night.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">I tell my former colleagues in the Government that I stand by my decision to leave them. Like many others, I can no longer believe them.</p>

Deputy Higgins has been honest on this issue. He has been elected to this and the previous Dáil on the basis of his opposition to these charges and, therefore, has a democratic mandate for his actions. Ordinary decent people from communities throughout Dublin have been jailed for peaceful democratic protest while tax dodgers, fraudsters, Ansbacher account holders, including politicians – past and present Members of this House – walk free. There surely is one law for the rich and powerful and another for the poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">Deputy Harney lectured us last night, telling us it behoves us, as elected politicians, to be honest with people. How dare she do so?

We all know what happened. The Progressive Democrats are now as dishonest as Fianna Fáil and, like the old days, are more Fianna Fáil than Fianna Fáil. What were we told about gardaí during the last general election campaign? It was said, "We will increase the strength of the Garda Síochána by 2,000 members."  What happened to that promise?

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Hospital Services.</heading>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_490">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_1025">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording Deputy Gogarty and I the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Peamount Hospital has given excellent service for many years in the area of services for TB and respiratory problems. It established a catchment area from the 1950s onwards. It is ironic that at this time a change has taken place and we hear talk of a new strategy for Peamount. I am always suspicious whenever I hear about new strategies. Being a medical practitioner himself, the Ceann Comhairle must have a view on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">There is a new proposal to change the emphasis and to provide a hospital rehabilitation section. I have no difficulties with that. It is an admirable proposal, but for a variety of reasons it should not happen at the expense of the existing and established services in Peamount Hospital. Despite the information provided in tabular form by the Department, tuberculosis is still with us and is a serious illness. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, may find that out. I do not wish to challenge his medical view, but there comes a time when all lay people have the right to challenge the medical view, and may be right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">I want to register the total opposition of all the people in the catchment area to this proposal to dismantle Peamount and introduce what is termed a transitional phase. When I hear about a transitional phase, I get worried, because transition is usually something that is coming to an end in so far as the provision of service is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">I have heard for many years that big is beautiful and that centres of excellence are the order of the day. In a report issued today, one reads of the benefits of the centres of excellence. What is proposed for the hospital in which we already have a centre of excellence? We propose to close it down and replace it with something else. This is extraordinary. It flies in the face of the Hanly report which has just been published.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">It is not logical to do what is now proposed. I reject entirely the strategy behind the proposal. If some people think that ordinary Deputies might not know anything about the issue, I served 19 years on a health board, where we examined minutely every report produced. I call on the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to use his influence to reverse the proposal.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_491">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_1030">The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is aware of the five year strategy. I broadly welcome it, but there is one item missing, a chest hospital along with related community care for the elderly in the catchment area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Why are these services being dropped? It does not make sense. It is stated on page 21 of the Peamount strategy document that a chest hospital option was examined. If the time and money were spent examining the option, what case was given for leaving it out? No justification is given for breaking up and scattering the expertise. There is indeed a new centre of excellence in the pipeline for St. James's Hospital, but this is for acute patients, a term not fully explained, not for the vast majority of clients currently treated at Peamount for TB and other respiratory disorders, nor for the elderly residents from Brittas, Newcastle, Saggart, Rathcoole, Lucan and beyond, into north Kildare. Where will they go and what plans are in place for them? Solutions might be found in the future, but if the hospitals are working now, why change a winning formula?</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">It seems that the board of management is not for turning. The chief executive and chairman have admitted that the process in developing the strategy was flawed. The board seems to have collectively acted incompetently, and members were misinformed as to the board's extensive powers to retain the chest hospital in spite of recommendations from Comhairle na nOspidéal. A false impression was given that what Comhairle proposed is binding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">Two weeks ago I, together with community representatives, met the board's chief executive and chairman. Some assurances were given for the future, including that of community representation on the board and the possibility of changing the charter to allow staff representation. The chairman indicated that if the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, or even the EHRA, asked for the chest hospital option, the board would have no objection. It could however have taken a pro-active approach. I asked the chief executive to do so. He said that the board had already met. It seems the chief executive was more interested in the primary role of selling off land for housing than acting in everyone's best interests. I found it disturbing that he was not willing to call a board meeting to review the situation in the light of new information, and representation from the community and local representatives who raised concerns on behalf of hardworking and vastly experienced staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">The strategy was flawed because the consultants' report was flawed, as was the information-gathering. A staff member complained about inadequate consultation, as did the wider community. There was minimal consultation with staff. The final consultants' report did not have any staff recommendations. No nursing input was sought or given nor was input sought from the multi-disclipinary team. All this expertise was ignored. The Minister must take a hands-on approach to direct the board or the EHRA to review the Peamount strategy and retain the chest hospital. As Deputy Durkan said, Peamount is the perfect location for the control of TB and non-acute respiratory conditions. It has spacious grounds in which people can get plenty of fresh air, all suited to the control of chronic disorders, unlike St. James's Hospital. Given that TB is on the rise, spreading patients throughout hospitals around the country will increase the risk. Peamount is one of the few hospitals in the country which is working. If it is not broken, why fix it? Let us make positive proposals with the other good recommendations in the strategy for the retention of the chest hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_1035">On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position on the issues raised by the Deputies. The Minister gave a comprehensive reply to Deputy Durkan on 9 October in response to questions raised with regard to the future provision of tuberculosis and respiratory services at Peamount Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">In July 2000 Comhairle na nOspidéal made a number of recommendations on the future organisation and delivery of respiratory and tuberculosis services. It recognised the valuable role which Peamount Hospital had played for many years. However, in line with major advances in medical treatment, it recommended that the optimal in-patient care of patients with respiratory diseases, including tuberculosis, was more appropriate to local acute general hospitals, staffed by consultant respiratory physicians and other consultants supported by an array of investigative facilities. Peamount Hospital was not regarded by Comhairle na nOspidéal as an appropriate location for the treatment of TB patients. Comhairle na nOspidéal has considerably more scientific knowledge of these matters than Deputies Durkan or Gogarty.</p>

          <p eId="para_1051">Comhairle na nOspidéal subsequently appointed a committee to advance implementation of the 2000 report which endorsed the recommendations in the earlier Comhairle report and was adopted by Comhairle in April 2003. Specifically, the committee recommended that Peamount Hospital play an active role in the provision of a range of non-acute support services, including pulmonary rehabilitation, within the South-Western Area Health Board. For example, it recommended that patients having been treated in the nearby St James's Hospital and other major acute hospitals and who required ongoing rehabilitative care could be transferred to Peamount Hospital for completion of their care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">The Minister understands that, in addition to the Comhairle na nOspidéal advice on this issue, the board of Peamount Hospital has developed a strategic plan for its development over the next five years. The hospital employed external support to assist it in this process and advise on developments in the wider health care environment. The strategy adopted by the board proposes considerable enhancement of existing services and development of new services in the areas of rehabilitation and continuing care of older people, persons with intellectual disabilities and adults with neurological or pulmonary illness. The implications for the acute respiratory services currently provided at the hospital are being assessed following which it is understood there will be further consultation with a range of relevant parties. The Eastern Regional Health Authority will participate fully in this process to ensure the interests of, and potential benefits to, patients of the region are fully realised.</p>

          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1059">I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue and ask that the Minister join me in welcoming the recently published report from Amnesty International, Mental Illness – the Neglected Quarter. It is not generally known and appreciated that up to 20% of children and adolescents suffer from a disabling mental illness. The chief medical officer at the Department of Health and Children concludes that epidemiological studies show that as much as 18% of the child population under the age of 16 years will experience significant mental health problems at some period of their development and that some 3% to 4% will actually suffer from a psychiatric disorder such as anorexia nervosa or a crippling obsessive compulsive state. The range of childhood mental illnesses includes depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders and, more rarely, serious forms of mental illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder which begin in childhood.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">Given the anticipated level of mental illness in children, the provision of an adequate and efficient children's mental health service should be a priority. Amnesty International concludes that there is limited availability of the appropriate range of services for those in primary care, community care, in-patient centres, day centres, rehabilitation service and outreach services which provide support in the home and school.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">There is no central data collection or reporting system on the uptake of children's mental health services at primary care or out-patient level. There is an urgent need for a centralised information bank based on nationally accepted and supported data collection methods, otherwise proper analysis of trends and statistics in relation to the quality or efficiency of service provision cannot be made by the Department of Health and Children or other interested parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">The World Health Organisation recommends a full range of therapies considered essential to modern psychiatric care, psychotherapy, physio-social rehabilitation and vocational rehabilitation and employment, yet in primary, community and in-patient care there is widespread over-reliance on medication alone as a form of therapy because the range of other therapies and therapists are not available. It has been observed that gaps in the range of services and professionals providing these services have resulted in uneven and restricted availability of psychotherapy and other interventions. This is due to a variety of factors, including a lack of funding for consultant psychotherapy and clinical psychologists posts and insufficient training for certain professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">While medication is an essential component of a treatment range, failure to provide the full choice of treatments is inconsistent with the right to the least restrictive or intrusive treatment. The Department of Health and Children working group agreed that internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is the provision of a multidisciplinary team. Many of the child psychiatric teams currently in place do not have a full complement of team members. Psychologists, mental health social workers and occupational therapists are widely unrepresented. Each member of a team supplies a unique and essential service and incomplete teams cannot, by definition, supply a quality service, despite their best efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">On patient services, health boards have no policies or procedures for children or adolescents requiring in-patient treatment. There is a large discrepancy between the actual and required numbers of appropriate acute psychiatric beds for children. The 2001 working group report recommended that 89 beds be provided, 35 for children aged six to 12 years and 54 for adolescents aged 12 to 16 years. Currently, there are 35 beds in three children's centres for those under 16 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">Why does the national waiting list initiative, whereby hospitals must publish waiting lists, exclude the mental health sector? There is no convincing explanation for this. Consequently, unlike other health sectors, no figures are published for waiting times for acute in-patient admissions to psychiatric institutions. This is inconsistent with the requirements to provide care and treatment in accordance with standards for other ill persons. Because of the changing profile of problems with age, child psychiatry services have found that the mid-adolescent age group, 13 to 15 year olds, has a propensity to take priority over younger clients. This is primarily due to their higher rate of emergency presentations with acute illness and suicide attempts and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">I hope the Minister of State will make known his views on the full report, not my extractions and quotations from it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_515">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1067">I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter, which is of the greatest importance in the provision of mental health services for children. The Government is fully committed to the development of child and adolescent psychiatric services and there have been major improvements in the level of service provision in recent years. We are endeavouring to build on that investment in the years ahead to ensure that we can further enhance services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">A working group on child and adolescent psychiatric services was established by the Minister for Health and Children in June 2000. It was to make recommendations on how child and adolescent psychiatric services should be developed in the short, medium and long-term to meet identified needs. The first report of the working group was presented to the Minister in March 2001. The report contains recommendations on the development of services for the management and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and hyperactivity kinetic disorder, HKD, and proposals for the development of child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient units.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">The working group recommended that a total of seven in-patient psychiatric units for children, ranging from six to 16 years, should be developed throughout the country. Project teams have been established in respect of the proposed units in Cork, Limerick and Galway and one in the Eastern Regional Health Authority at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">The working group found that the internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multi-disciplinary team, as the Deputy has strongly pressed. Between 1999 and 2003, additional revenue funding of €14.94 million was allocated to provide for the appointment of additional consultants, the enhancement of existing consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams and the establishment of further teams. The national health strategy includes a commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the working group's report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">The second report of the working group, published in June 2003, contains proposals for the development of psychiatric services for 16 to 18 year olds. It recommends that in the further development of the child and adolescent psychiatric service, priority should be given to the recruitment in each health board area of a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with a special interest in the psychiatric disorders of later adolescence. The working group's report further recommends that arrangements should be made with the relevant adult psychiatric services for the admission to acute psychiatric units of persons aged 16 to 18 under the care of a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with a special interest in the psychiatric disorders of later adolescence, where such a consultant is available. The report emphasises the importance of co-operation and close liaison between child and adolescent child psychiatry and adult mental health services and suggests that the current arrangements, whereby the adult services provide a service for the population of their catchment area, including the 16 to 18 age cohort, should continue on an interim basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">Further implementation of the recommendations of the report of the working group will be considered in the context of the Estimates process for 2004 and subsequent years. The future direction and delivery of all aspects of the mental health services, including child and adolescent psychiatry services, will be considered in the context of the work of the recently established expert group on mental health policy. The expert group will report within 18 months. It is my intention to ensure that psychiatric services for children and adolescents, both in-patient and community based, will continue to be prioritised in the context of available resources.</p>

The freight yard has been a long established part of Mallow, providing employment and valuable services to industry in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">The plan to close the yard must be seen against the background of the desire by Irish Rail to get rid of the bulk of its freight business. As far back as 2001, there were reports that Irish Rail was considering proposals to exit from the bulk of its rail freight business, but the public and political reaction compelled the company to climb down. However, since then it appears that there has been a gradual downgrading of the freight service by stealth. Individual services have been quietly closed down while freight is being increasingly forced off the rail system on to the roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">This trend appears to be the case with Mallow freight yard. Figures provided to me suggest that during 2002, some 1,464 wagons of freight passed through Mallow freight yard, generating revenue of more than €350,000. The closure of the yard will create serious difficulties for existing industrial users and may make it difficult to attract industry to the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">Apart from the economic issues, the transfer of this level of freight to the overcrowded road network will have major environmental implications. It is unbelievable that at a time when there is so much public concern about the number of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles and the damage they are causing to the environment, Irish Rail should be planning to put more lorries on to the roads. The closure of Mallow freight yard would result in hundreds of additional lorry journeys, many through small towns and villages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">It is difficult to believe that such a development should be considered given the general acceptance of the need to reduce the number of heavy goods vehicles on the roads. A European Union White Paper, published in 2001, emphasised the need to transfer more freight on to environmentally friendly forms of transport, such as rail. Following a number of horrific accidents in Switzerland, serious consideration is being given to banning freight from the road system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">This move may save Irish Rail a small amount of money, but the financial and social cost to the community in terms of damage to the road and built environment will be high. The Munster area is already facing a significant increase in the number of heavy goods vehicles on the roads, especially during the sugar beet season. Following the collapse of the Cahir viaduct last week on the Limerick Junction-Wexford line, this will continue until it is reopened, which will take at least six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">It has been suggested to me that the existing crane at Mallow freight yard is inadequate. I am advised that is not the case. I understand a fork lift truck is available in Tralee that could be easily transferred to Mallow. I urge the Minister of State to ask Irish Rail to reconsider this proposal in view of the economic and environmental implications.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</from>
          <p eId="para_1080">I thank Deputy Sherlock for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to set out the present position regarding Irish Rail's plans for its freight business on a national basis and in connection with Mallow. Irish Rail is currently in the process of re-shaping its freight business to reduce the losses of recent years and focus the business more closely on customer needs. The collapse of the Irish fertiliser industry in 2002 dealt a severe blow to the freight element of Irish Rail's operations. This traffic contributed significantly to the company's bottom line.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">Irish Rail has indicated that it has now decided from a business point of view to shift the emphasis to point to point operation of unit load trains. I am pleased to note that as a result of this new approach, the company has already had success in securing suitable traffic, including the Coillte contract to transport raw timber from the west direct to Waterford for processing. Other similar types of traffic are being targeted for the future and the company has stated it believes it has a marketable service to offer. Exploring the scope of joint ventures and private sector participation are among the initiatives being pursued. In pursuing this course of action, Irish Rail is confident it can transform the business from a loss of €16 million in 2002 to a modest profit before exceptional items by 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">The rationalisation has required the closure of the Mallow rail freight yard. Arrangements are being made to provide and maintain the existing levels of service by transferring the work handled at Mallow to the North Esk depot in Cork. The two regular customers who currently use the Mallow yard will be facilitated by transporting their containers by road from North Esk. This involves only a small number of daily movements of containers. Irish Rail has consultations under way with these customers on the proposed changes and there will be no loss of business to Irish Rail or the companies concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">On a more positive note, Irish Rail has indicated to me it is proposing to introduce an improved passenger commuter service between Mallow, Cork and Cobh later this year involving new rolling stock. This will improve public transport access between the two population centres and will enhance the role of Mallow railway system.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_518">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_1084">I raise this matter to ensure the Government encourages the Garda authorities to increase the number of policing fora, particularly in Dublin, and to look on this as a transitional period as it moves towards a scenario where all districts will have a district policing board similar to that envisaged in the Patten report for the Six Counties. Patten's recommendations set the minimum standard that this State should try to achieve so that policing issues can be dealt with in an accountable and transparent manner. The Garda should be democratically accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">I have attended a number of meetings of the Rialto policing forum and I have found them to be useful and enlightening but the problem is the forum has no powers or resources. If such fora are not resourced and are not given specific issues to address and on which they can have an effect, they will not gain the confidence of their communities and will become no more than talking shops. Proper policing fora or boards are required which are democratically accountable and which make decisions on resources, location of Garda stations, the number of gardaí deployed in the area and even the priorities of local policing. Gardaí are more interested in traffic matters than in drug dealing taking place next to them. Such issues are of major concern to communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">The Garda's policing plan for 2003 states, "The Community Relations Section will continue to support the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 by preparing proposals for a new model for community policing forum and consolidating the best aspects of the forum experience."  There have been positive aspects but the fora have not had a major effect on the areas in which they have been operating. Hopefully, they will because the work of the people and the gardaí who have attended the fora is commendable but it is not worth it if there are no results at the end of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">Ballyfermot is my area and it has a drug task force. The area suffers from major crime problems, including drug dealing, car theft and so on. Ballyfermot does not have a policing forum but the local Garda inspector is willing to meet all community groups on an ongoing basis. However, there is no statutory basis for such meetings and when the next inspector comes along it might be different. District fora or boards should be put on a statutory footing to stem the loss of confidence and trust in policing that has crept in gradually in certain areas because the Garda has not been resourced properly to respond to emergency and other calls. The Garda must be able to call on resources to tackle crime. Money should not be spent on guarding politicians, traffic duty and so on. The Minister plans pilot programmes to address traffic issues but, hopefully, he will put more effort and time into community policing fora and put them on a statutory footing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1088">The Deputy stated the Patten report had set minimum standards for the accountability of policing in Northern Ireland. However, while Sinn Féin objects to Nationalists joining the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Deputy is calling for more community policing fora to be introduced here.

          <from>Dr. McDaid</from>
          <p eId="para_1090">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I would like to respond on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The concept of community policing fora has emerged in recent times in a number of different contexts, including, <i>inter alia,</i> local drug task force plans, the RAPID initiative and the Garda's own initiative in Dublin's A district, which includes Rialto and parts of Dublin's south inner city. These fora demonstrate the ongoing commitment of the Garda to working closely with local communities and local authorities in developing policing and estate management strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">A prime example of the success to date of this partnership concept is community policing and estate management in Dublin's north inner city, established in 1999 under the first action plan of the local drug task force. This has allowed for the development of a dialogue between the police and local community on drugs issues and has also enabled Dublin City Council to address estate management, such as poor lighting, improved public access or actions to tackle the activities of anti-social tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">Since 1999, it has been receiving ongoing financial support from the Government via the local drugs initiative fund and following a positive independent evaluation, Dublin City Council has recently decided to put the project on a permanent basis by including it in its mainstreamed programmes from January next. A similar community policing forum will shortly be established by the Finglas-Cabra local drug task force. This forum, which will be established on a pilot basis for one year, is also receiving financial support from the Government via the drugs initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">The Garda has been proactive in Dublin's A district in terms of developing one such forum to help improve relations and communications between local communities, the local authorities and the Garda in that area. The initiative consists of monthly meetings held locally in each forum area, chaired by independent chairpersons and attended by representatives from the different sectors involved, including local community representatives. Once again, active community involvement and support is a key element in the success of this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">Officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently met senior Garda management regarding how best this forum might develop and work is ongoing to ensure that the success achieved by the initiative to date is built upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">With regard to a number of the other issues raised by the Deputy, a new city centre policing initiative was launched on 9 June 2003 by the Assistant Garda Commissioner for the Dublin metropolitan region. This initiative provides a high visibility policing presence in specific target areas in the north and south city centre areas. It targets issues of concern such as public order, assaults, street theft and shoplifting. Another Garda initiative, Operation Boulevard, targets anti-social behaviour in the environs of O'Connell Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">Specifically in relation to the areas mentioned by the Deputy, the Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that the assistant commissioner of the Dublin metropolitan region directed the implementation of a co-ordinated policing plan for the Rialto and south inner city area to combat anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and other public order related offences. The Minister has been informed by the Garda that the plan, which involves numerous drug related operations and searches, has been very successful to date. It has resulted in arrests for drug related crimes and public order and road traffic offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">The Minister and I share the Deputy's concern on the issue of car theft. There are many targeted Garda operational measures in areas that have been identified as potential hot spots for so-called joyriding. In addition, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has provided funding for a pilot strategy in north Dublin. The strategy involves developing joint initiatives with local agencies and the community to prevent young people from joyriding; engaging with joyriders, including those in custody; developing alternatives in education, training and leisure; and developing appropriate models of family support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">There is no room for complacency in dealing with these serious issues. Tackling criminal activity and anti-social behaviour, as well as the misery they cause, particularly in communities which experience severe disadvantage, will remain a priority issue for the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16 October 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1102">I have noted the recommendations of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention regarding Mountjoy Prison. There are two possible options in regard to the replacement of the outdated prison accommodation at Mountjoy Prison. The first option is to redevelop the prison on the existing site, involving the demolition and reconstruction of existing buildings. The second option is to relocate the prison to a greenfield site. Exploration of the economics and feasibility of these options is ongoing and it is not possible to say when a decision is likely to be made as to which option should be pursued. The possibility of acquiring suitable lands in the Dublin area and surrounding counties, however, will have a major bearing in deciding on which option to pursue.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_523">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_1104">I asked the legal advisory group in September 2002 to report to me on the issues involved with regard to defamation to make recommendations. This request was on foot of the commitment in the programme for Government. I was conscious that there had been a number of recent developments in this area of the law in other jurisdictions which share our legal tradition. I was also conscious that if we were to have a modern and responsive defamation code that was consistent with best international practice, it was important that these developments be assessed and analysed with a view to their possible incorporation into our domestic regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">I brought the report of the expert group to Government in June 2003. I should emphasise that it is the group's report, it is not a report by me to Government or indeed a report of the Government. The Government has made no decision in respect of the substance of the contents of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">The report contains some 23 separate recommendations. The group also put forward a suggested text for a new defamation Act which would replace the Defamation Act 1961 in its entirety. This is a very useful and helpful approach since we are concerned with a potential legislative outcome and it is, therefore, very informative to see how it is that the various recommendations would translate into legislative form.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">Some of the recommendations are more challenging than others. The issue of a statutory press council has been the subject of much comment and analysis since the publication of the report. One of the more specific of the legal advisory group's terms of reference was to consider the nature and extent of any statutory intervention which might attach to the establishment of any entity concerned with the regulation of the press. This is a subject where there is some divergence of views as to the optimum approach to be followed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">On the one hand, there is a need to achieve a form of regulation which is effective and in which the public can have confidence. On the other hand, care must be had to ensure that any regulatory framework does not trespass needlessly upon the traditional freedoms which the press enjoys in all democratic societies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">The group, having carefully weighed up the options, recommended the establishment of a statutory press council with functions which would include the preparation of a press code of conduct and the investigation of complaints concerning alleged breaches of that code. The report sets out in some detail the main features of such a council, including matters pertaining to its operation and structure and the draft defamation Bill contains a template for the legislative intervention which would be required were such an entity to be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">There are other important recommendations in the report. For example, the proposed new defence of reasonable publication; the suggested re-balancing of the role which judge and jury have at present in defamation actions which are commenced in the High Court; the Circuit Court to have jurisdiction in all defamation cases where the amount of the damages claimed does not exceed €50,000; a suggested one-year limitation period for defamation actions and the enshrinement in legislation of a defence to be known as the "defence of innocent publication" which would be available, among others, to broadcasters, distributors, printers and Internet service providers.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_53">I would also point to the fact that the group endorsed many of the recommendations put forward by the Law Reform Commission in its report on the civil law of defamation, such as those recommendations touching upon the making of an apology, court lodgements and the rationalisation of the defences of absolute and qualified privilege. It is a mark of the excellence of the work done by the Law Reform Commission that the report which it prepared on this topic remains so seminal and so influential.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_54">Some of the recommendations contained in the report are more radical than others and will, inevitably, provoke considerable comment. That in itself will, hopefully, have the merit of securing an informed and wide-ranging debate on this important topic. In that regard, I decided, in consultation with my colleagues in Government, that the best way to proceed was to have a period of public consultation which will allow all interested parties who so wish to comment on the substance of the recommendations contained in the report. To that end, as well as inviting written submissions on the report, I propose to hold a high level conference on Monday 1 December to facilitate an exchange of views from distinguished practitioners from the media, legal, academic and other sectors. Such a consultative process will assist me in ensuring that the legislative proposals which I will ultimately bring to Government will have been enriched by the views and opinions both of media interests and of the ordinary citizen. The Government remains committed to the reform of our defamation law.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_1112">The UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination defines "racial discrimination" as any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin. To suffer from racial discrimination Travellers would need to suffer distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin. The Government's view over the years, and repeated in the draft report under the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, has been that Travellers do not constitute a distinct group from the population as a whole in terms of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. In the preparation of equality legislation, it was considered that discrimination against Travellers would not be covered by the term "discrimination on the ground of race". Therefore, a separate ground – membership of the Traveller Community – on which it is unlawful to discriminate was put into equality legislation. This was not meant to provide a lesser level of protection to Travellers compared to that afforded to members of ethnic minorities. On the contrary, the separate identification of Travellers in equality legislation guarantees that they are explicitly protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">Some of the pressure to recognise Travellers as an ethnic minority in Ireland arises from a desire for Travellers to be protected by international human rights instruments such as the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, CERD. The Government is committed to applying all the protections afforded to ethnic minorities by the CERD equally to Travellers. For this reason, the Government has included in detail the steps taken to tackle discrimination against Travellers in an appendix to Ireland's draft report under the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. However, the Government is not prepared to include in the report a statement it does not believe to be true, namely that Travellers are ethnically different from the majority of Irish people.</p>

          <p eId="para_1115">The Deputy will be aware that there are separate provisions governing the granting of legal aid in relation to criminal and civil matters and different criteria apply to the granting of legal aid under each scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings. An accused person is entitled to be informed by the court in which he or she is appearing of his or her possible right to legal aid. The grant of legal aid entitles the applicant to the services of a solicitor and, in certain circumstances, up to two counsel in the preparation and conduct of his or her defence or appeal. The courts, through the Judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid. An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him or her to pay for legal aid himself or herself. In this regard, an applicant for free legal aid may be required by the court to complete a statement of means.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_55">Furthermore, the court must also be satisfied that by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid. However, where the charge is one of murder or where an appeal is one from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court, free legal aid is granted merely on the grounds of insufficient means. Eligibility for legal aid in criminal cases is determined by the judge hearing the case and I have no function in this regard.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_56">The Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 provides that all applicants for civil legal aid must undergo a means and merits test before a determination is made in relation to their eligibility for civil legal aid. The basic criteria for the granting of legal aid and advice is set out in section 24 of the Act. Under the Act, the decision in relation to individual eligibility is a matter for the Legal Aid Board.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1119">Non-nationals who are resident in the State must ensure that they have a legal basis for residence and, even if they become the parent of a child born in Ireland, they must continue to ensure that they have a legal basis for their residence. Now claims for leave to remain in the State from the non-national parent of an Irish-born child on the sole basis of the parentage of the child are considered only in the context of a proposal to deport the person concerned. In considering claims for leave to remain in the State from the non-national parents of Irish-born children, the circumstances in each case will be examined and each case will be decided individually. Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 sets out the timescale and the matters to be considered in these cases.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_57">There were some 11,000 claims for leave to remain which had not been finalised before 19 February 2003. In those cases where the persons have an alternative legal basis for remaining in the State, they are being informed that their claim will not be considered. Where the persons do not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in the State, they are being issued with a letter informing them that they may be subject to deportation and inviting them to give reasons why they should not be deported. A decision will be made individually in each case based on the facts of the case and in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_58">The Government recognises that the workload in dealing with the 11,000 cases on hands is substantial. Additional staff are to be provided in my Department to assist in processing these cases as quickly as possible. With the approval of the Minister for Finance, staff are to be obtained for a period of one year as a levy on Government Departments to deal with this issue. I expect these staff to be in place in the near future.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_59">The applicants are also being given the option of returning voluntarily to their countries of origin with, if necessary, payment of their transport costs. The International Organisation for Migration is available to assist persons who wish to avail of their services in this regard.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1137">In early 2000, a national steering group on prison based drug treatment services was established by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service at the request of the then Minister. Its brief was to progress the issue of drug treatment and associated services within the prison system, particularly in the Dublin area. The group includes representatives of the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">The national steering group produced a report on prison based drug treatment services in July 2000. It consulted widely with external groups prior to the drafting of this report. A public advertisement inviting submissions from interested parties was placed in the national newspapers on 27 January 2000 and 22 submissions were received from various parties such as healthcare professionals, community and voluntary groups as well as from individual members of the public. The national steering group considered all of these submissions in finalising this report. The Irish Penal Reform Trust and Merchant's Quay Project were two of those organisations whose views were submitted and considered by the group.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_66">The Irish Prison Service recognises that voluntary drug treatment organisations and task forces based in local communities, especially those in which the majority of offenders normally reside, are central to the through care and after care arrangements for prisoners in receipt of drug treatment in custody. The governors of the main Dublin prisons were subsequently requested to establish liaison groups with relevant community and voluntary interests to facilitate dialogue and through care for persons treated in prison for drug dependency and with a view to enhancing the partnership approach to this issue. As a result, the prison and community drugs liaison group was established in 2001 and meets on a regular basis. This forum provides a mechanism for a regular exchange of views between prison management and the community and voluntary sector.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1197">During this period, sanction to employ additional staff was conveyed to the board. Since 1997 sanctioned posts in the board's law centre network increased from 191 to 215, of which 89 are solicitor posts, an increase of eight solicitor posts.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_76">The Deputy will appreciate that under section 5 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, it is a matter for the Legal Aid Board to provide, within its resources and subject to the other provisions of the Act, legal aid and advice to persons who satisfy the requirements of the Act. The board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases, for example domestic violence, child care, child abduction and other cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately and such applicants are not placed on a waiting list. Such a system for priorities is necessary to ensure that, for example, persons who are subjected to domestic violence and cases involving the care of children are provided with speedy service. In 2001, priority appointments offered by law centres was approximately 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">In addition, managing solicitors at law centres have authority to give priority to any case on the waiting list at their centre. For example, if an applicant is gravely ill or in cases where an applicant is in danger of losing assets or of losing title to a legal remedy if legal services are delayed, the managing solicitor can accord such cases priority status.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_78">The board continuously monitors the operation of its law centre network to ensure that its resources are used to maximum effect in making its services available to the greatest possible number of eligible persons. In this regard, the additional management posts which were made available in recent years are enabling the board to develop a more structured change management approach to the provision of civil legal aid throughout the State. This approach is geared to examine the throughput of cases at law centres and where waiting times, for whatever reason, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1203">I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 106 and 191 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">I can assure the Deputies of my Department's continued commitment to tacking homelessness among persons released from custody as part of the Government's integrated approach on homelessness. The theme of the homeless preventative strategy published in February 2002 to which the Deputies refer is the progressing of a range of measures focused on a number of identified risk groups, including prisoners, and which are to be advanced under the auspices of a cross-departmental team on homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">In line with the strategy, the homeless offenders strategy team, HOST, a multi-agency accommodation directorate, has been established, with the probation and welfare service as the lead agency and an assistant principal probation and welfare officer as director of the team. Appropriate levels of clerical and administrative support staff have also been provided to HOST to enable the team to carry out its functions.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_83">The team has a national remit in relation to both offenders under probation and welfare service supervision in the community as well as those in and leaving custody, and provides a focus for identifying and redressing pathways into homelessness associated with offending and imprisonment. Dublin City Council has seconded a senior staff member to work on a full-time basis with the team. Appropriate liaison arrangements have been established by this team with the Irish Prison Service.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">The team also works in close partnership with a range of community and voluntary bodies already providing valuable services to homeless offenders and those at risk of homelessness. HOST has developed a strategic action plan which is intended to facilitate the implementation of a co-ordinated accommodation strategy in the context of established policies on homelessness and within current resource limitations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_85">In relation to the transitional housing units issue, while it has not so far been possible for the Irish Prison Service to progress the building of the proposed transitional housing units from its own capital resources, discussions are ongoing with the probation and welfare service, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and a number of local authorities with a view to resourcing the development of a number of transitional accommodation facilities to cater for the needs of ex-offenders.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_86">The recently published Irish Prison Service annual report for 2002 contains information, on a prison by prison basis, on a variety of pre-and post-release initiatives now in place in the prison education units. Ten vocational education committees make the largest contribution to, and are the mainstay of, the prison education service. This facilitates linkages between the prison education units and the local vocational education committees in relation to those prisoners seeking to continue education after release from prison. Funding is also being provided by the relevant vocational education committees to post-release support initiatives catering for offenders, such as Pathways and the Bridge project, both in Dublin and Dillon's Cross in Cork.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">As regards the Deputies' queries concerning monitoring, the cross-department team on homelessness, which reports to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, is responsible for monitoring and overseeing the implementation of the homeless preventative strategy. Both the Irish Prison Service and the probation and welfare service have representatives on the cross-departmental team which regularly provides progress reports to the Cabinet committee on the relevant actions required under the strategy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">Finally, the policy planning and research unit of my Department has allocated funding for research into aspects of homelessness among offenders which has been commissioned by the probation and welfare service. It is expected that this research report will be completed before the end of the year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1207">Work is well under way on the development of the fixed charge processing system, FCPS, in the Garda Síochána which will facilitate the full implementation of the penalty points system. The Garda Síochána is partnering with external consultants to build and implement the FCPS system. When the contract was signed in September 2002, it was stated that development of the system would be completed by the first quarter of 2004 with implementation by the Garda Síochána to commence in the second quarter of 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_1209">The conviction rate shown in the report is based on the number of cases reported to the gardaí which resulted in a conviction in court. In relation to cases where sufficient evidence is available to allow a prosecution to be taken, the recent report, The Criminal Jurisdiction of the Courts, otherwise known as the Fennelly report, shows that figures from 1998 to 2001 indicate that the conviction rate based on cases where a prosecution is proceeded with is 71%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">As the Deputy may be aware, there is a high attrition rate in rape cases in Ireland and a large number of cases reported to the gardaí do not reach prosecution stage for a variety of reasons. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has recently provided funding for further comprehensive research into attrition rates in rape cases. The research, which is entitled The Understanding of Attrition, Early Withdrawal, the Trial Process and Identifying Possible Changes to Support Complainants in Rape Cases, will be carried out by the department of law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and the Rape Crisis Network Ireland. This research should give us greater understanding as to why some victims choose not to report cases to the gardaí, what we can do about underreporting and why, of the cases that are reported, only a relatively small percentage result in a court hearing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1215">The disability legislation consultation group is a group representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers. It was brought together by the National Disability Authority to input to the consultation process initiated by Government in April 2002 with regard to the disability Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">A meeting took place on 15 July 2003 between the Taoiseach, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, and the disability legislation consultation group. The discussion covered such matters as assessment of need, standards, service provision, the need to build capacity in key sectors of the public service so as to allow provision of disability accessible services in a cost effective way and workable redress mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">The disability legislation consultation group was assured of the Government's commitment to publish the disability Bill as a matter of priority. The aim is to publish the Bill in November 2003, following the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1220">Perjury, that is, the giving of false evidence on oath or affirmation, is an offence in common law, although a number of statutes also address matters incidental to the offence. The offence is committed by any person lawfully sworn as a witness or as an interpreter in a judicial proceeding who wilfully makes a statement, material in that proceeding, which he or she knows to be false or does not believe to be true. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for seven years.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_89">I propose to strengthen significantly the law, as it applies to those who make false or exaggerated personal injury claims. In this context, I have published the heads of the civil liability provisions to be included in the civil liability and courts Bill. These provisions include proposals for the dismissal of actions or defences where a court is satisfied that a party to a personal injury claim has knowingly tendered evidence or delivered a pleading which is materially false or exaggerated. Parties to such actions will also have to swear an affidavit verifying the content of their pleadings. A specific statutory offence will be created in respect of falsely swearing a verifying affidavit and this will carry a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment and/or a fine. I also propose to provide for a statutory offence of tendering or adducing false evidence with similar penalties.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_90">The Deputy may also wish to note that the question of putting common law offences, such as perjury, on a statutory basis, will be one of the issues considered by the expert group on codification which is currently examining approaches to codification of all substantive criminal law in a new crimes Bill.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1321">I am prioritising Garda recruitment and training to bring the strength of the force up to its maximum authorised strength of 12,200 as soon as possible. To this end, a new Garda recruitment competition is under way. A total of 690 Garda trainees were admitted to the Garda Training College this year. The Garda Commissioner has projected, based on the anticipated rate of retirement, that this level of recruitment will result in the maximum authorised strength of 12,200 being achieved during 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">The Government remains committed to achieving its objective of an increase of 2,000 in the strength of the force as soon as budgetary and public service number considerations permit.</p>

          <p eId="para_1328">The information sought by the Deputy on deaths in prisons and places of detention as a result of suicide or drug overdose is set out in the following table.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">However, statistical data on attempted suicides, self-harm and drug overdoses not resulting in death is not readily available and would require extensive searches of individual files and records. Such incidents would also prove difficult to categorise <i>vis-à-vis </i>self harm or attempted suicide as a judgment on intent would be required from the compiler of the statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330">The National Suicide Research Foundation established the national parasuicide registry in 2000 as a national monitoring system for the occurrence of parasuicide. The National Suicide Research Foundation defines parasuicide as any non-fatal act which an individual deliberately undertakes knowing or believing that it may cause them physical harm or even death. It includes acts involving varying levels of suicidal intent including definite attempts at suicide and acts where the individual had no intention of dying. The Irish Prison Service agreed with the foundation in 2001 that the registry should include prisons and places of detention in its statistics and the foundation undertook to compile the statistics from records kept within each prison or place of detention.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_104">The foundation has recently informed my Department that they propose to include a chapter on prisons and places of detention in their annual report for 2002 which they expect to publish shortly. In addition, the Irish Prison Service has been moving in recent years towards centralised record systems based on the use of information technology. Considerable progress has already been made in this area and I am informed that further work is under way at present. A number of areas including those the subject of the Deputy's question are under active consideration in this regard.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">All deaths in custody are the subject of a Garda investigation and an inquest held in a coroner's court. The cause of death is determined by a jury on the basis of the information presented to the court. The number of deaths which are attributed to suicide are as follows.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_106">In 1999 there was a total of six deaths – Mountjoy (male) Prison, three; Mountjoy (female) Prison, one; Cork Prison, one, Wheatfield Place of Detention, one. In 2000 there was a total of three deaths – Wheatfield Place of Detention, two, Mountjoy (female) Prison, one. In 2001 there was one death at Castlerea Prison. In 2002 there was a total of four deaths – Castlerea Prison, one, Cloverhill Prison, one; Mountjoy (male) Prison, one, Wheatfield Prison, one. To date in 2003, there has been one death at Castlerea Prison.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">Inquest verdicts are pending on the 2002 case in Mountjoy Prison and the 2003 case in Castlerea Prison. However, the apparent cause of death would indicate that suicide may have been a possible intention in these cases.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_108">I attach figures for the deaths in prison custody in the instances where the coroner's court verdict indicated that drug overdose was either the sole cause of death or a major contributing factor.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_115">The Irish Prison Service proposal to eliminate overtime holds out the prospect of substantial savings annually, not alone in budgetary terms, but also in terms of hours worked by prison staff. I am keen to secure staff agreement for the measures necessary to produce these savings. In my previous response, I outlined that, in the event that agreement is not forthcoming, I will have no option but to introduce a range of short and long-term measures to permanently reduce prison service expenditure.

          <p eId="para_1366">As indicated in the foreword published with the general scheme of the Bill on 30 July 2003, I hope to have the Bill ready for introduction in the Oireachtas by the end of this year and, with the co-operation of the Houses, to have it enacted as a matter of priority. Work on the drafting of the Bill is currently proceeding in parallel with the ongoing consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">It is the Government's intention that the inspectorate will be established as soon as possible following the enactment of the Bill. It would be premature at this stage to indicate what the likely staffing complement and budget of the new body will be.</p>

          <p eId="para_1369">I welcome the recent publication of the 2002 annual report of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. The report is a detailed and informative record of the procedures involved in the filling of judicial vacancies. In this regard, I note that, in the case of vacancies in the High Court and the Supreme Court, the report states that the number of applicants has, on occasions, been relatively small. Nonetheless, no difficulties have been experienced in filling such vacancies to date. I will keep the matter under review. With regard to the recommendation concerning medical examinations, the matter is currently receiving attention within my Department.</p>

      asked the

      the steps being taken to reduce the cost of keeping prisoners in custody; the reason it costs more than ?200,000 per year to keep a prisoner in Portlaoise Prison, but less than half that amount in Mountjoy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_576">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_1375">Pay costs – basic pay, allowances and overtime – account for approximately 75% of running costs in the Prison Service. The average cost of keeping an offender is calculated by averaging out the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders in those institutions. These costs include certain items which are fixed regardless of the number of offenders in custody, for example, utilities, staff salaries, etc. It also re-allocates the cost of central services, for example,  Prison Service headquarters, the Prison Service training centre and IT to each prison institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376">The relatively high cost of keeping a prisoner in Portlaoise Prison arises primarily because of the unique nature of the prisoners held there and the consequent security considerations, which require a higher staff to prisoner ratio. The cost is in the order of €206,700 per year, per prisoner based on 2002 figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">I am fully committed to addressing the issue of costs across the Prison Service with particular reference to the cost of overtime. In that context I refer the Deputy to my recent reply to Parliamentary Question No. 192 of 9 October last concerning my proposals for the ending of overtime by prison officers and the position regarding negotiations with the Prison Officers' Association. In that response, I indicated that a proposal for change currently with the staff side for ballot involves organisational change and revised working and attendance arrangements for staff. It is aimed at replacing overtime costs by adopting a more efficient annual hours attendance system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378">Overtime costs alone in the Prison Service are running at an estimated €63 million to €64 million per annum, which constitutes in excess of 20% of the costs of the Prison Service. The Prison Service proposal to eliminate overtime holds out the prospect of substantial savings annually in hours worked by staff and in salary costs. The cost of the Prison Service would be substantially reduced if this reform were adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379">I am keen to secure staff agreement for the measures necessary to reduce prison service costs. In the event that agreement is not forthcoming in the near future, I will have no option but to introduce a range of short and long-term measures to reduce Prison Service expenditure. While I am hopeful that agreement can still be reached, my officials have recently informed staff representatives that plans will be refined and action will follow if by end October an agreed way forward is not clearly in prospect.</p>

          <p eId="para_1434">The average participation rate on the community employment, CE, programme is expected to be in the region of 22,500 during 2003 with a projected year-end participation rate of 20,000. The allocation of places and renewal of individual projects is a matter for FÁS. Projects are prioritised based on the services provided. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given priority. CE places in the health sector, which includes personal assistant services, are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_135">The CE programme is currently under review. An overall appraisal of active labour market programmes is being carried out under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. FÁS is also currently completing an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, JI, which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly. A decision on the future participation levels on CE and JI will be taken in the context of the Estimates provision for 2004, having regard to the outcome of the current review process, which is now nearing completion. The position of older workers, who may have difficulty progressing to employment and the appropriate timeframe for implementation of any changes, will be considered in the course of the review.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_1442">The welfare of animals during transport is a priority for my Department both to ensure that animals being transported are treated in a manner which safeguards their welfare and because such an approach is essential to ensure that the live trade is preserved. In addition, checks and controls in this area are required by national and EU legislation. As the work involved constitutes one element of an array of livestock related activities carried out by Department personnel, I regret that the costs of administering this system are not readily available in the form requested by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1443">There are a number of dimensions to my Department's work in this area. On international transport by road vehicle, any vehicle approved for the carriage of animals beyond the territory of the State undergoes an inspection by departmental veterinary inspectors to confirm that it is designed in a manner which ensures the welfare of animals during transport. Approved vehicles are kept under review and re-inspected at regular intervals. On average, 120 such inspections of road vehicles take place annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_1444">In addition, for each journey undertaken, route plans detailing the proposed itinerary are submitted to district veterinary offices and the journeys proposed are required to be in compliance with legislation governing the protection of animals during transport. Prior to departure, the health of the animals is examined at the point of origin to ensure fitness for transport. In addition, consignments of livestock for export are subject to regular spot checks on welfare, documentation and means of transport at Rosslare Port.</p>
          <p eId="para_1445">On the carriage of cattle by sea, my Department has an inspection and approval system for vessels intended for the carriage of livestock. Independent marine surveyors carry out inspections on such vessels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1446">There have been no prosecutions in the years 1999 to 2003 regarding international transport of livestock. Sanctions are, however, applied where infringements of EU or national legislation are detected. These include suspension or removal of vehicles from the register or the suspension or revocation of the authorisations of transporters. In 2003 to date, for example, nine road vehicles have been suspended from the approved list.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_136">At national level, veterinary inspectors undertake inspections aimed at ensuring that standards of animal welfare apply at all stages of animal transport under the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals during Transport) Order 1995 and the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals during Transport) Amendment Order 1997.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_137">This legislation requires in principle that any person involved in the transport of animals must handle them with care and ensure their safety during transport. The animals must be fit for the journey. The vehicle must be suitable for the species of animal to be carried and it must be maintained to a structural and hygienic level that does not pose any risk to the welfare of the animals during their journey. My Department has published a leaflet, Guidelines for Animal Welfare During Transport Within Ireland. In addition, random spot checks are carried out on vehicles at marts and meat factories.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_138">In the event that welfare is compromised, enforcement action is initiated, including prosecution. In 2002 there was one successful prosecution for offences under the Protection of Animals Act 1911 regarding the welfare of animals at the time of transportation.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1461">Section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 requires financial institutions to take reasonable measures to identify their customers. Recommended procedures for the implementation of this provision are set out in guidance notes issued under the aegis of the money laundering steering committee which is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes representatives of financial services industry bodies and State agencies, including the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_1462">Paragraph 28 of the guidance notes states that any measures adopted by credit institutions should not deny a person access to financial services solely on the grounds that they do not possess certain specified identification documentation. Paragraph 45 of the guidance notes provides for those persons who cannot reasonably be expected to produce certain forms of identification, such as a person who does not have a passport or driving licence and-or whose name and Irish address does not appear on a utility bill, electoral register or directory.</p>
          <p eId="para_1463">The case mentioned by the Deputy appears to arise from a difficulty in verifying address in the absence of a utility bill. The alternatives set out in the guidance notes include: a letter or statement from a licensed employment agency that the person has recently arrived in Ireland and is commencing employment or from an employer that the person has commenced employment and in each case stating that the person is not in a position to produce a utility bill or other document which shows an Irish address, in addition, in such cases the prospective customer should be required to submit follow-up documentation, for example, a utility bill confirming Irish address in due course; a letter or statement from a person in a position of responsibility, for example, a solicitor, accountant, doctor, minister of religion, teacher, social worker or community employment scheme supervisor, who is in a position to confirm the person's address to the credit institution, in such instances the person providing the letter or statement must present themselves to the relevant credit institution providing proof of their own identity and verifying their status to the credit institution; and documentation or cards issued by a Department showing the address of the person.</p>
          <p eId="para_1464">Normally difficulties arising at account opening are resolved by an approach from the prospective customer to the branch management or to the bank's customer service department. It is a matter for each institution to ensure that its procedures satisfy the legal requirement under the Criminal Justice Act 1994 that financial institutions take reasonable measures to identify their customers.</p>

In 2002, 433 out of a total 705, about 60%, of the organisation's predominately male clients were Irish. In 1983 the organisation was offered the use of 60 Ashford Road, through the good offices of the local parish. The building in question is the property of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster and the CHC has had rent-free use of the property for almost 20 years. It is the location of the day care centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1469">I understand that following a decision by the diocese to sell the building, the CHC was offered first refusal and negotiated a purchase price with the diocese.

I am informed that its business plan for the period 2002 to 2007 expresses confidence that sources of funding for the balance of the project will be identified through a fundraising campaign.

[23530/03]</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_155">Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely): The assessment of an individual application for nursing home subvention is a matter for each health board in the first instance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_156">Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. The current rates are €114.30, €152.40 and €190.50, depending on the dependency of that person, be it medium, high or maximum.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_157">Apart from contracts entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident. Article 22.4 also permits the health board to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention, in cases where, for example, personal funds are exhausted.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_158">The board has informed my Department that there are currently 72 people on a waiting list for subvention in its functional area as follows: 64 in Cavan/Monaghan, six in Louth and two in Meath. The board has estimated that it would cost €260,000 for the remainder of this year to deal with all the cases on the waiting list based on an average subvention payment of €300 per week per client. As the Deputy is aware the service plan and budget for service provision in 2003 for the North-Eastern Health Board was submitted to my Department and approved earlier this year. I should point out that each health board, when administering the nursing home subvention scheme, is obliged to have regard to its overall budget allocation as notified in the letter of determination from my Department.</summary>

        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_628">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_1563">I propose to take Questions Nos. 196, 198 and 199 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1564">In 1999 the Land Registry launched its integrated title registration information system, ITRIS, together with its electronic access service, EAS. A fundamental component in the overall success of the project was identified at an early stage as the need to substantially increase the volume of information available for customers on-line. After careful and thorough analysis, document imaging was identified as the most efficient solution to this challenge.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_191">As a result, the Land Registry's document imaging programme, with support from the Government's information society fund, commenced in January 2002. This was the culmination of what was one of the projects progressed by the registries partnership committee established under Partnership 2000. To date over 3.5 million pages of information, representing all paper folios and filed plan maps in respect of 16 counties, have been imaged and are now available for customers on-line. Approximately 12,000 to 14,000 new images and their associated names indices are being made available each day. One of the early decisions made was to scan all documents in colour. From the colour image a black and white copy is derived and is available for customers via the Internet. All certified copies are issued in colour. This has led to the provision of a considerably enhanced product for customers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_192">In a survey conducted during 2001 the Land Registry's customers identified as their main priority – by a considerable margin – the availability of folios and filed plans for inspection and the availability of certified copies of these documents. Already the document imaging project has delivered a considerably enhanced service for both staff and customers of the registry at all locations. All feedback from customers and staff has confirmed this. In the paper environment clearly a document could only be in one place at a time. Thanks to imaging the same document can be available to multiple users at a wide variety of locations at the same time. This eliminates frustrating and time consuming tasks for staff and customers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_193">In addition to the vast improvement in customer service, on the completion of imaging – scheduled for the end of 2004 – the registry will have, for the first time ever, land records both current and historic which will be secure. The Land Registry will then have a complete back-up of title records – folios, filed plan maps, index maps and names indices.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_194">The Land Registry now creates all new folios in a fully structured digitised format. In parallel with the imaging of folios all existing unstructured folios, both paper and imaged versions, are converted to fully structured folios on the lodgement of an application for registration. Each day approximately 500 to 600 are converted. It will be some time however before all 2 million folios are held in structured format.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_195">In parallel with this project the Land Registry has continued to see an ongoing increase in demand for its products and services. It would appear that the ready availability of documents and their availability via the Internet has led to an increase in demand. It is to be noted that the number of subscribers increased from 700 in 1999 to 4,400 in 2002 and that the number of business transactions, that is, inspections, applications, copies etc., conducted through the electronic access service, EAS, increased from 36,496 transactions in 1999 to 274,561 in 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_196">Since the launch of the ITRIS and EAS systems the volume of work being processed by the Land Registry has continued to grow. The following table outlines this growth for the two major categories of work:</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_209"/>
        <summary eId="sum_210">In addition to advances in technology additional staff were allocated during this period. For example, when the Land Registry decentralised part of its operations to Waterford in 1997-1999 approximately 140 staff were employed at that location. Today 190 posts, filled by 205 staff, are allocated to Waterford. A further benefit of the project will be to free up much needed space at all our offices and facilitate an enhanced working environment for all staff.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_211">The project overall will have the same impact on the operations of the counties served from the Waterford office as it is currently having on the counties served from the other locations. It will enhance customer service, improve the quality of the products and services, reduce frustrations of staff having to work in a paper environment thereby improving staff morale, contribute to improved productivity, reduced waiting times and delays and ultimately lead to increased customer satisfaction.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1572">I have been informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that Finglas Garda station is in the DMR west division. The personnel strength of Finglas Garda station as at 14 October 2003 was 69 – all ranks. The personnel strength of the DMR west division as at 14 October 2003 was 610 – all ranks. This represents an increase of 16, or 2.7%, in the personnel allocated to the DMR west division since 31 May 2003. It is the responsibility of the divisional officer to allocate personnel within a division as he or she sees fit. Local Garda management is satisfied that the resources in the DMR west division are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_212">The transfer of personnel is a necessary requirement for the efficient running of the force, and can of course result in minor variations in strength in Garda stations from time to time, as in this case where there were five outward transfers and three inward transfers. Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the DMR west division with a view to ensuring an effective Garda service is maintained.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1580">In 1996, the development of the multi-agency approach under the Criminal Assets Bureau marked a turning point in the tackling of organised crime in Ireland.

Several of the major organised crime groups have been targeted by the CAB and a considerable number of criminals have had property confiscated and their wealth taxed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1581">The CAB is effective across a broad spectrum of criminal activity. During 2002, for example, more than a dozen organised crime groups were investigated. Nearly half of these groups were involved in drugs trafficking and about a third were involved in armed robberies-aggravated burglaries. There investigations also focused on protection rackets, diesel smuggling, cigarette smuggling, VAT carousel fraud and social welfare offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1582">The establishment of specialist Garda units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda national drugs unit, operating under an assistant commissioner in charge of national support service, has also enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_1583">For instance, the Garda national drugs unit plays a crucially important role in the efforts to combat drug trafficking. Operations are designed to target the supply of drugs to the Irish market and the transit of drugs through Ireland. The unit co-operates with a wide range of international law enforcement agencies and provides significant levels of support to international agencies and the domestic customs service alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_1584">The success of the unit can be gauged by the increase in the street value of drugs seizures in recent years: €20 million in 2000; €45 million in 2001; €49 million in 2002. Other smaller units, including the money laundering investigation unit and a unit dealing with theft of computer components, have also had success in combating the activities of organised criminals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1585">The money laundering investigation unit, which is attached to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, is involved in the investigation of suspicious transaction disclosure reports. Investigations of reports are carried out by the unit itself or may be forwarded to the CAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_1586">Local Garda detective units throughout the country are also involved in such investigations. As a result of the unit's close co-operation with the CAB and local units, a number of actions have been taken against criminal assets.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_214">The number of suspicious transactions reports received by the unit in 2002 increased by 45% since 2001. It is likely that yet more reports will be made in 2003 with the extension of reporting provisions of the money laundering legislation to cover dealers in high value goods. It is estimated that reports will also increase as a result of new legislation requiring designated bodies to report suspicions of terrorist funding.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_215">The theft of computer components has resulted in the development of two important measures. First, a specialist unit has been formed within the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation to address this area of crime. Second, close liaison between the police and the computer industry has paid considerable dividends in terms of the reduction in the number of thefts in transit in Ireland. The liaison has been recently extended to deal with the prevention of software counterfeiting. There are indications that some of the groups formerly involved in this activity are focusing their activities elsewhere.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_216">I can assure the Deputy that my commitment to tackling organised crime is unwavering and, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner, I am constantly evaluating our response to this problem. In this context, I will take whatever measures are necessary to deal with this menace.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1588">The most comprehensive victimisation survey to date was carried out as part of the quarterly national household survey conducted by the Central Statistics Office in late 1998. The survey found that the percentage of crimes reported to the Garda varied considerably, from over 95% in the case of car thefts to less than 40% in the case of vandalism. The level of reporting of crimes depended on such factors as the seriousness of the crime and whether an insurance claim was being made. The survey also found that 63% of all assaults are reported to the Garda. Over a quarter of those who did not report an assault did not consider it important enough to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1589">While there are general claims of underreporting of crime, there is no evidence that the level of underreporting now is any greater than in the past, or that the level of unreported crime in Ireland is any greater than in other jurisdictions. The problems of unreported and unrecorded crime are well documented in the international criminological literature, and are in no way unique to this country.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_217">Furthermore, the introduction of PULSE has improved the accuracy and comprehensiveness of Garda statistics – for example, the system demands that incidents now have to be recorded before particular actions can be taken.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_218">Steps are, however, being taken to obtain a more accurate estimate of the level of victimisation in Ireland. Following a recommendation of the national crime council, the Government has agreed that a biennial crime victimisation survey should take place. In addition, the CSO will have a module on crime and victimisation in its next national household quarterly survey. International victimisation surveys, such as the Eurobarometer, while having small sample sizes, show the Irish crime rate as comparing favourably with other countries.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_219">Finally, I would like to remind the House that, in January 2003, I established, with Government approval, an expert group on crime statistics chaired by Mr. David Kennedy to examine the methods of collation and presentation of crime statistics by the Garda Síochána and other authorities involved in criminal prosecution. The expert group is expected to report by January 2004.</summary>

The adequacy of resources is a matter which is kept constantly under review and at the moment is the subject of particular examination in the context of the annual Estimates process. Parallel with this, I have recently published legislative proposals to significantly enhance the criminal investigative powers of members of the Garda Síochána and to comprehensively reform the law on the governance of the force.

The Schengen convention provides comprehensive provisions on data protection rights for information contained in the SIS. That includes provision for a joint supervisory authority, JSA, to ensure that these data protection rights are duly implemented and upheld. The JSA is made up of two representatives from the national supervisory authority of each participating state and is responsible for supervising the technical support function of the SIS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1610">While Ireland does not yet participate in the Schengen information system, it is represented as an observer on the joint supervisory authority by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. A new Schengen information system, SIS II, is planned to come into operation by the end of 2006. This system is required to cater for the enlargement of the European Union and to allow for the introduction of some new functions as well as updating the existing information technology platform which is now reaching the end of its life span. The development of SIS II was discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in June of this year and agreement was reached on the broad functional requirements of the new system. These include provisions for the recording of certain biometric data.</p>
          <p eId="para_1611">Legislative measures will now be required for the purpose of the development of SIS II which will be the subject of further discussion in the Council. There are two further legislative measures required to enhance the Schengen information system before SIS II comes into effect and they have been under discussion in the Council framework. These proposals are to allow access by Europol and Eurojust to relevant SIS data. Transmission of any such data to third countries by Europol or Eurojust would require the consent of the member state concerned and would be subject to oversight by the Europol joint supervisory body for data protection and the Eurojust joint supervisory body for data protection, respectively.</p>

          <p eId="para_1627">The termination of the new house grant scheme was a difficult decision that the Government was required to take in order to ensure a sustainable match between Government resources and expenditure. In terminating the new house grant, the Government has sought to ensure fair treatment first by ensuring that all applications approved or pending in my Department will, subject to the normal conditions of the scheme, qualify for grant payment. In addition, people who had already made commitments in the form of signed contracts or by the pouring of foundations on or before 14 November 2002 were given an opportunity to apply for the grant. In providing a grace period up to 4 December 2002 for cases such as these, first-time buyers who are at the most advanced stage of purchase or building are being facilitated as far as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1628">In this context, it was recognised that arrangements differ for new houses purchased under affordable housing schemes in that successful applicants for affordable housing are generally only required to sign a contract by the local authority at a very late stage, often after they have occupied their new home. For this reason, applicants for new house grants are regarded as having entered into a contract to purchase an affordable house where a written offer of an affordable house was made by the local authority or by a body standing approved for the purposes of section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 on or before 14 November 2002. In such cases it was a requirement that the relevant local authority notified my Department to this effect on or before 4 December 2002. In all cases, it is a condition of payment of the grant that the house is completed and occupied by the applicant by 13 November 2003. I am very aware that difficulties are being faced by some new house grant applicants in meeting this deadline. Consideration is currently being given by my Department as to how these difficulties might be addressed bearing in mind the need to ensure fair treatment and to achieve closure on the scheme.</p>

The Ringsend waste water treatment plant, officially opened by the Taoiseach in June, provides for the waste water treatment requirements of all of Dublin city and south Dublin, significant areas of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal, and parts of County Meath. By the end of 2003, Cork, Limerick, Galway and many other smaller urban areas will also have state-of-the-art waste water treatment facilities in place and operational.</p>

The latest phase of my Department's water services investment programme, covering the period 2003 to 2005, includes all the schemes required to give effect to the commitment in the programme for Government that all centres with a population of over 1,000 will have secondary waste water treatment in place, or at an advanced stage of planning, by 2005.</p>

          <p eId="para_1633">Funding for group water schemes and for conversions from single to three-phase electricity is provided under two separate measures of the CLÁR programme. Under the group water schemes measure, CLÁR provides top-up funding to a maximum of €4,382 where the cost per house in a CLÁR area exceeds €7,618.42, rather than for a specific cost element of the proposed project. This is additional to normal Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government grant aid for group water schemes. In other words, all costs, including power supply, are included in the estimates for work to be carried out when calculating the above figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1634">Under the second measure, CLÁR funds the cost of the customer contribution to the ESB for conversion from single-phase to three-phase electricity supply for small businesses and enterprises in CLÁR areas, subject to certain limits. Group water schemes are therefore ineligible for support under this measure, otherwise double funding of such projects would arise. The person concerned may be eligible to apply under the first heading above, subject to the conditions outlined.</p>

          <p eId="para_1636">In the situation outlined by the Deputy the payment of supplementary welfare allowance is not considered appropriate to the scheme. If the level of maintenance payments arising from a divorce settlement leads to a situation whereby an individual, whether in employment or on social welfare, finds that he or she has inadequate funds with which to meet his or her basic needs the most appropriate course of action would be to renegotiate the settlement to take account of current financial circumstances. In instances where welfare support is provided to single parents in the form of one-parent family payment from my Department the other parent is legally required to contribute to the cost of this payment. In this regard, the maintenance recovery unit of my Department seeks to trace the liable relative involved in order to ascertain whether he or she is in a financial position to contribute to the cost of the one-parent family payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1637">The assessment of a liable relative's ability to contribute to the cost of the payment is based on the individual's net income. Account is also taken of any dependant children he or she may reside with and certain outgoings such as mortgage repayments. Liable relatives who earn less than €13,000 per annum or whose main source of income is a social welfare payment are not deemed by my Department to be in a financial position to meet weekly maintenance payments and accordingly they are not assessed with maintenance liability by my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_1639">The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance education scheme designed to assist unemployed people and other disadvantaged groups being held back in their search for employment by a lack of qualifications. A review of the basic purpose underlying my Department's back to education provisions was carried out last year. In the light of this and the expenditure constraints facing us this year the scheme was revised. In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme I was conscious of the need to ensure that payments were focused on those who most need training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. In line with this, payments under the scheme for the summer period were discontinued for BTEA participants who were in receipt of an unemployment payment as many students traditionally find seasonal work at home or abroad during the summer months. Of course, participants in the scheme who failed to find employment during the summer were entitled to claim unemployment assistance or benefit, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions. All other participants on the scheme – lone parents and people with disabilities – remain unaffected by this decision and retain payment during the summer period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1640">The BTEA scheme was also revised in respect of people who wish to pursue certain full-time postgraduate courses. These now no longer qualify for BTEA purposes. All of the people concerned are already in possession of a third level qualification and I am satisfied that they have already achieved a good level of academic attainment which should impact positively on their employment prospects. In a time of financial constraint, I wanted to ensure that supports were directed at those with the most pressing needs. Those wishing to take up a higher diploma in all disciplines or graduate diploma in primary school teaching are not affected by these changes. I am satisfied that the new arrangements ensure that the back to education scheme continues to provide support to those people who are most distant from the labour market. I have no plans to change the current conditions of the scheme though I will continue to monitor it in light of the changes in place to ensure that it is operating effectively and is reaching those who need help most.</p>

          <p eId="para_1642">The back to work allowance scheme was reviewed last year in the light of economic and labour market changes and, in particular, of the drop in unemployment levels since the introduction of the allowance in 1993. This review also took cognisance of the decline in take-up of the scheme and of an evaluation of the scheme by independent consultants who recommended restructuring in light of the transformed labour market situation and the opportunities for people to get back into the labour market without assistance. The evaluation report recommended that the scheme be refocused on the longer-term unemployed, that the non-financial supports be enhanced, and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced. Following this review, the qualifying period for persons on unemployment benefit or assistance has been increased to five years with effect from 1 January 2003. Other social welfare qualifying payments are not affected by the change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1643">PLANET – the network of area-based partnerships – recently submitted proposals with a view to lowering the current qualifying period for the self-employed strand of the back to work allowance scheme. A review of the national employment service is currently taking place. In addition an interagency group has been conducting a review of all labour market programmes under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It would be appropriate to await the outcome of these deliberations before any further adjustments to the scheme are considered. In the meantime, I will continue to monitor the scheme in light of the changes in place since January to ensure that it is operating effectively and that it is reaching those who most need help.</p>

          <p eId="para_1645">Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, health boards may make a single payment, known as an exceptional needs payment, to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income. Eligible people are usually in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. Exceptional needs payments are not issued in individual cases on an ongoing basis. They are issued at the discretion of the health board and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1646">The South-Western Area Health Board was again contacted regarding this case and has advised that there has been no recent contact between the couple and the board regarding a change of circumstances.
