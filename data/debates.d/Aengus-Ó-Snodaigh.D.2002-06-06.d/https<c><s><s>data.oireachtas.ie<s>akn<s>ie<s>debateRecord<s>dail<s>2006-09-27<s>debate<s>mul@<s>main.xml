         asked the

         her plans to publish the report of the interdepartmental working group on long-term care; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [29757/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#SeanPower" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_1">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_2">The interdepartmental working group was established to review a number of complex and fundamental policy issues pertaining to long-term care for older people.  Some of these issues were the subject of the Mercer report on financing long-term care and the O'Shea review of the nursing home subvention scheme.  Following consideration of the group's report, a series of key principles to inform policy was endorsed by the Government and incorporated into the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_3">These principles include, for example, that there should be one standardised national needs assessment for older people needing care.  The use of community and home-based care should be maximised.  Sheltered housing options will be encouraged.  Where residential care is required, it should be quality care and there should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  The level of support for residential care should be indifferent as to whether that care is in a public or private facility.  The financial model to support any new arrangements must also be financially sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">That agreement also notes the steps which have already been taken by the Government to improve services for older people this year, including the special funding package of €150 million announced in budget 2006.  Reflecting the new emphasis on home and day care, almost three quarters of this funding is being invested in community care supports, such as home care packages, home helps and day and respite care.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">The interdepartmental group has continued to meet to help draw up proposals for a new policy on long-term care based on the principles endorsed by Government and the social partners.  I plan to bring proposals to Government as soon as possible.  When the Government has finished its consideration, I expect to be in a position to publish the report of the group.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
            <p eId="para_6">I wish the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, well for the future.  This is her first public appearance since giving up leadership of the Progressive Democrats.  It will take a while to get used to addressing her simply as "Minister".  Some people might still consider her the real Tánaiste.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">On the question of funding long-term care, the problem is that we have been waiting so long for this report.  What is the problem?  It was part of the health strategy in 2001, and we have had the Mercer and O'Shea reports since 2003.  An interdepartmental group has been working with the Cabinet for the past 12 months, yet the Government still has no policy on funding long-term care.  The Minister's reply was generic, covering various aspects of funding care of the elderly rather than simply long-term care.  There is a sense that the Department is all at sea when it comes to looking after the elderly, and that is why we ask what is going on today.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">This morning, at a meeting of the Select Committee on Health and Children, the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, brought forward legislation on funding services for the elderly.  The legislation was full of holes, and discussion on it was unbelievable.  The Bill as presented is essentially incapable of being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">The same is true with regard to protecting the elderly.  We now learn that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, legislation also promised for this session will not arrive until next year.  That means we do not have a social services inspectorate to protect elderly patients or any clear Government policy on how to look after elderly patients or fund their long-term care.  There is a sense that the Department is totally lost and has no idea what is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">When the Minister of State stands up, he cannot speak of "complex and fundamental" problems.  They must be very complex and fundamental if, after five years of thinking and talking about them, he cannot formulate even the most basic policy.  When he produces one, I hope it is nothing like the legislation he presented to the Select Committee on Health and Children this morning.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">This is Question Time, and the Deputy should ask a question.</p>

          <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
            <p eId="para_12">We deserve to see this report and learn what is happening in this regard.  If this is being discussed as part of a partnership approach and nothing is coming from the Oireachtas on Government thinking on funding care of the elderly, that is wrong in itself.  Has the Minister of State any idea what is going on?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanPower" eId="spk_5" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_13">We have plenty of ideas, and the notion that we are all at sea on this could not be further from the truth.  It is obvious that we have given the matter extremely serious consideration and that the entire issue has been through the social partnership process.  That is one reason it has been delayed to some degree.  However, it gives one an understanding of the priority we have accorded the matter.  I stated to the Deputy what extra moneys were provided in last year's budget, particularly for services for older people, and that is having a major impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">The Deputy mentioned the nursing home subvention scheme that we discussed this morning.  People have difficulties, and there are problems regarding the relationship between public and private providers.  Several issues were discussed by the group, which has reported to the Government on progress.  In turn, the Government has agreed that several principles should inform the next stage of that work.  They will include providing an equitable level of State support for residential care, whether it be provided by a public or private facility.

            <p eId="para_15">What we need is progress.  We have no social services inspectorate or eligibility legislation, and major problems are being reported daily regarding care of the elderly.  If the Minister of State has policy ideas, perhaps he might share them with us.  If he has difficulty working them out, Fine Gael will do its best to help him overcome his problems.  However, he should share them with the House and not simply the social partners.</p>

            <p eId="para_16">We will certainly share our proposals, and if the Deputy has any views or suggestions he wishes to put forward, we will be more than happy to take them on board.  He mentioned standards, and it is intended that the Health Bill 2006, whose heads were published for consultation some months ago, should establish the Health Information and Quality Authority.  This Bill will also put the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis and will contain provisions to underpin a much more robust inspection system.  The chief inspector of social services will be required to monitor against standards set by the Health, Information and Quality Authority for residential services provided to older people, among other categories.  We are making considerable progress in the area and providing extra funds to improve existing services.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_18">I have sought the up to date position on PPARS from the Health Service Executive and it has informed me as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_19">The PPARS system is currently used for recording human resource data for 70,000 HSE staff and is used to pay 30,000 staff each week.  The HSE's PPARS project review committee has completed its review.  Arising from that, the HSE has decided on a set of actions aimed basically at meeting the requirements of the new unified health service with a single management, rather than those of separate health boards working on an IT project together, which is how the PPARS project started in 1995.  These actions involve defining precisely the HSE's human resource, payroll and employee services requirements and maximising the efficiency of the project from its current situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_20">This plan of action follows an update to the HSE board from the PPARS review committee, which highlighted that while the project is delivering many benefits, some business issues remain to be resolved.  These include the major and ongoing changes since 1995 to the business environment in which the project operates; the need to further standardise processing systems and the need to clarify the project's objectives and scope within the new single structure.  It is envisaged that this work will take several months to complete and I am anxious for it to be completed as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">The timing of this work has nothing to do with the general election taking place next summer.  To suggest or speculate otherwise is wholly without foundation and an injustice to the HSE board and its management.  The estimated costs of the work will have to be determined by the project group being established to progress these actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">The recent request on the Government's e-tender website related to the HSE's request for assistance with the definition of its information and reporting needs to meet its requirements and obligations under the new unified HSE structure.  The assistance being requested does not relate to the further roll-out of the PPARS project, the decision on which is being deferred until the necessary work has been completed.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Ms McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_23">This really is a right old mess.  It is now generally accepted in the public mind that we have a tax and waste Government.  We have seen the waste of money on e-voting and on PPARS, which already is about €130 million.  We find that some 30,000 people are being paid using this system at the moment.  Does the Minister yet know how many people are employed by the HSE and what the precise number is?  This review follows after a ten-month period of review within the HSE.  Why do we need another nine-month review period? I did not create that timescale.  The HSE is telling us it will take up to nine months, which takes us beyond the next general election.  How much will it cost?  Will consultants be employed to carry out this work?  At the end of the day what is the benefit in terms of ensuring we have a system, which has already cost the taxpayer enormous sums of money without any significant results?</p>
            <p eId="para_24">It seems incredible, after years of PPARS, that the Minister is now reaching a point where a review is to be carried out in the context of a unified system.  The HSE is a unified system.  We have had a national health executive since 1 January 2005.  How is it that at this point we are now facing another review?  The Minister will not tell us how much it will cost, but I ask her to say what the budget for it is and whether yet more consultants are to be employed.  It seems to me private consultants have made enough money out of this cash cow without shovelling more money at them.  Who will do it?  How much will it cost?  How long will it take?  How many people are working within the health service, which is the responsibility of the Minister?</p>

            <p eId="para_25">It was decided to pursue this course in 1995.  I do not wish to make a political point, but nobody on this side of the House was in office when this decision was made.  It has recently come to light that the money was not appropriately spent at the time.  There was a system for the 11 different health boards.  The HSE employed outside consultants to conduct its internal review, which cost £99,227 for 94 hours consultancy.  In light of that review, it was decided it should not be rolled out until it appropriately specifies what it wants for a unified organisation.  The HSE pay 30,000 staff using the system and it has the human resource records of about 70,000 staff.  In total, the HSE has about 102,000 staff, when hospital staff are included.  That figure can vary from time to time.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">The Minister has not answered the question.  We still do not know how many people are employed.  She has not told us how much the review will cost.  I am talking about the review and the plan to which the Minister referred.  Will she employ consultants to carry out that work?  We have already spent money on consultants for the review since last November.  I remind the Minister that the only reason PPARS was halted was because Professor Drumm took action.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">He appropriately took action.  Professor Drumm is the CEO and Accounting Officer of the HSE.  I said in my reply that the HSE had gone to tender on this matter, so I cannot speculate on what it will cost until we see the outcome of the tender.  Even if we had an idea, we would not want to influence the tender by suggesting what it might be.  The roll-out of IT is fundamental to reform of the health system, at both hospital level and in community services.  We will have to spend a considerable amount of money updating our technology to deliver the health system that everyone expects.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_13" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_29">I presume the question refers to allegations published in a number of newspapers regarding a company which has expressed an interest in operating private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals.  The company in question has refuted the charges made in the newspaper articles.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">The Health Service Executive is currently engaged in a public procurement process for the co-location of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals.  In view of this, I am not in a position to say anything further about any particular company which may be involved in bidding to build a private hospital on the site of a public hospital.  However, I assure the House that bids will be subject to a thorough evaluation by the HSE.  There will be a rigorous value for money assessment of any proposal and this will take account of the value of the public site and the cost of any tax expenditure.  Any transaction will be on a commercial basis and will fully protect the public interest.  In addition, there will be full adherence to public procurement law and best practice.  This initiative is designed for one purpose, namely, to achieve up to 1,000 additional public beds at less than half the traditional capital cost.  I am fully confident it will achieve this objective and our health services will be enhanced as a result.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_14">
            <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_31">I thank the Minister for her reply.  She has correctly identified the company in question as Triad, one of the bidders for six co-located hospitals and which is also managing the Beacon Hospital.  This company is a subsidiary of an American corporation that pleaded guilty to criminal fraud.  This hospital chain, Columbia/HCA, paid a total of €1.7 billion to settle US Government fraud charges.  Triad is currently under contract to its parent company for services that include patient accounting, which was the nub of the fraud case taken by the US Government against it.  Does this information set off alarm bells for the Minister? In light of this information, does the Minister believe that providing massive inducements in the form of giving public land to such American companies is the right way forward?  Instead of cutting costs, could they increase inordinately if the same pattern occurs here?  Hence, while I am aware the Minister believes us to be closer to Boston than Berlin, do we really wish to Americanise our health system so health becomes a commodity to be traded in the market place?  The Minister must realise that health is much more than that.  It concerns people's well-being and using the market model may be ill-advised.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_15" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_32">Members must be careful not to abuse their privileged rights.  The company in question has vehemently denied the Deputy's suggestions.  I understand many newspapers, on receiving correspondence from the company, did not continue to report on the story.  I am not an advocate for any company.  Any company that might be awarded a contract by the Health Service Executive would be obliged to be subjected to a robust due diligence process.</p>
            <p eId="para_33">As for co-location, on which another question has been raised, there has been significant expression of interest.  On average, there have been approximately six bidders per site, many of which are Irish companies.  The entire purpose of that initiative is to provide additional public bed capacity at less than half the cost of using traditional methods.  Furthermore, currently the State pays 100% of the capital cost of private beds in public hospitals and staffs them.  It pays all the revenue costs while the insurance or self-payers only contribute approximately 45% to 50% of the cost of those beds.  From a patient perspective, this does not make sense.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">Health care pertains to the provision of high quality services and I do not believe we should have any ideological blinkers as to how that might happen.  We have public provision, not-for-profit provision and for-profit provision.  For example, the Bon Secours group is a not-for-profit organisation that provides outstanding health care.  Hence, it is not the case that we must go exclusively one way or the other.  The different methods of funding health services should complement one another provided the criteria are based on quality of service.  Quality of service to patients is my only interest.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_16">
            <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_35">Does the Minister agree that leaving health care aside, our experience with public private partnerships has been far from rosy and the customer has not benefited?  One needs only to consider the toll roads or the M50 and in my constituency, a public private partnership built a so-called state-of-the-art sewage treatment plant.  These projects have not gone to plan and are costing the consumer far more than anticipated.  Hence, there is no such thing as a free lunch and the idea that public private partnerships can work out cheaper is a myth.  The indisputable evidence regarding this company is that it is a spin-off from Columbia/HCA, which was forced to sell some of its hospitals to pay its fraud bill.  By 2003, Triad Hospital's parent company, if it can be so described, had paid the United States Department of Justice a total of $1.7 billion, a great deal of money.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">Members have already heard references to other projects such as PPARs and I have raised the question of iSoft.  We appear to have got off on the wrong foot from the outset.  In light of this information, I ask the Minister to remain vigilant.  I also ask her to respond to the initial point, namely, that our experience with public private partnerships has not been good.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">We have hardly any experience of public private partnerships.  We have experience of public projects being constructed by the private sector.  Public private partnerships are about transferring the risk from the public to the private sector, thereby allowing taxpayers' money to be used where one might not attract that kind of interest.  As I have frequently noted, the idea that we should fund 100% of the capital cost of private beds in public hospitals and subsequently run them does not make any sense from the perspective of patients in the health care system.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">I hold no brief for any company.  As for the company in question, I understand the HSE has proceeded to expressions of interest and has not yet awarded any tenders for any co-locations.  Obviously, a strict due diligence process is required.  However, for fairness, I note the company in question has strongly refuted the allegations made by the Deputy.</p>

         her views on the report into the death of PJ Walsh in Monaghan Hospital; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_18" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_40">At the outset, I wish to convey again my sincere sympathy to the Walsh family on the death of Mr. Patrick J. Walsh.  Following his death in Monaghan General Hospital on 14 October 2005, the Health Service Executive commissioned Mr. Declan Carey, a consultant surgeon at Belfast City Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Queen's University, and Professor John Monson, professor of surgery University of Hull, to carry out an independent and external review.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">The HSE published the report of the independent inquiry on 7 September.  The report details the difficulties that arose in trying to secure Mr. Walsh's transfer from Monaghan to either Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda or Cavan General Hospital.  It also exposes a failure in communications between clinicians and hospitals in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">The reviewers considered that making the changes would definitively remove the risk of similar clinical incidents occurring again in the region.  Since the death of Mr. Walsh, a new protocol for patient transfer has been put in place.  It provides that all requests for transfer from Monaghan General Hospital to Cavan General Hospital or Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda should be granted and processed immediately.  The HSE recently established a steering group and a north-east project group to oversee a programme to improve safety and standards across the acute hospital network in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">The Teamwork report makes a number of short, medium and long-term recommendations.  It concludes that the present system, where five local hospitals deliver acute care to a relatively small population, is exposing patients to increased risks and creating additional professional risks for staff.  The report highlights the need to develop a high quality and responsive emergency and planned service, in line with international standards, by developing local services within existing hospitals and other local centres supported by a new regional hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">Led by the HSE's National Hospitals Office, a steering group has representation from key stakeholders such as clinicians and primary care providers.  The project group is being led by a consultant surgeon from outside the region, Dr. Eilis McGovern.  The HSE has given me an assurance that, in progressing the implementation of these reports, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_19">
            <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
            <p eId="para_45">The events leading up to the death of Mr. Walsh were tragic, but what is emerging from the report into his death is equally damning of the Government.  The report states that the events that led to Mr. Walsh's death still occur daily in the Monaghan Hospital region.  The report also states that the consistent theme that emerged was that neither Cavan Hospital nor Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has sufficient capacity to deal with current patient demands.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">On the basis of those findings, I would like the Minister to answer a number of questions.  As matters stand, who is responsible for highlighting new or existing protocols?  A failure in making known to people the existing protocols contributed to Mr. Walsh's death.  Does the Minister know who is responsible for making new or existing protocols known to all staff working in all these hospitals in the area?</p>
            <p eId="para_47">Does the Minister know if all the acute hospitals in the country have a programme of clinical governance and who is responsible for clinical governance?  Is Professor Drumm ultimately responsible for making sure every hospital has a programme of clinical governance in place to ensure that such an incident will not occur in another hospital?  It is important for the Minister to explain to the House whether such a programme is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">I have two further concerns.  On the basis of the Teamwork report, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is expected to take all critically ill patients from the north east, but it has received no additional funding to care for these additional very sick patients.  It is fine for the Minister to say what she said in her reply and we all fully sympathise with the family of Mr. Walsh, but as a member of the Government, the Minister is doing nothing to stop a similar incident occurring, unless she ensures that additional funding is made available to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">Another matter of concern that reached my attention is that the proposed extension of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital under the capital building programme has been suspended.</p>

            <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
            <p eId="para_51">I ask the Minister if that is true.  Is she aware the capital building project for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has been put on hold?  Talking about a new hospital for the north east is along the lines of building castles in the sky, when there are currently huge deficiencies in services in the north east.  Talking about doing something for them in 15 years' time is absolute nonsense, when there are problems now in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and Cavan General Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_52">I will put a very important question to the Minister.  I do not know if she is aware that Cavan General Hospital is subject to an absolute obligation to receive surgical transfers from Monaghan General Hospital.  A problem which arose in the case of the death of Mr. Walsh was that nobody took responsibility for his transfer.  If Cavan General Hospital is told it must now take every single patient from Monaghan, does the Minister know if restrictions still apply to surgeons in Cavan which preclude them from carrying out major GI surgery?  There is no point in a patient having an absolute right to be transferred from Monaghan to Cavan when, upon arrival, he or she will not be operated on and no intensive care services will be available for them.  That is the reality on the ground and those are the key questions I would like the Minister to answer.</p>

            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_53">A new protocol for patient transfer has been put in place.  It is the responsibility of the HSE to oversee what happens in the different hospitals in the region.  We already know that approximately half of the patients in the region attend not local hospitals but hospitals in Dublin.  That is the largest ratio of all the regions in the country for people attending Dublin hospitals rather than those in their own region.</p>

The authorities in Cavan have visited Mullingar and I welcome that.  It is good that hospitals work with each other to improve performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">The report was produced by clinicians, not politicians, administrators or bureaucrats.  Clinicians made the recommendations therein.

That is why, as a matter of priority, the HSE has appointed a group, headed by Dr. Eilis McGovern, who is a well-known heart surgeon and well-respected clinician, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations for the region.  Clearly there will be difficulties implementing the recommendations because change is never easy but we will ensure that what happens at each hospital is founded on patient safety.  Whatever can safely be done in a particular hospital will continue to be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">There are issues around clinical governance nationally but normally it is the responsibility of the medical board of a hospital.  In the context of a new contract of employment we want to move to the clinical directorate model, currently operating very successfully in St James's Hospital in Dublin and representing best practice norms around the world.  On foot of the Harding-Clark report the Department of Health and Children has done some work on these issues.  There are still huge deficiencies in what happens on the ground and legislation may be necessary for the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">The question related to matters over which the Minister has control, namely, the current day-to-day spending increase for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is to look after critically ill patients, and whether the capital project for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has been stopped.  When the Minister said there were problems in Cavan and Mullingar did she, on seeing such glaring problems, make herself aware as to the reason for them?  What are those problems?  I have an idea why they exist but if I were Minister for Health and Children, I would try to do something about them rather than just highlight them as though I were a disinterested party.  If she knows what the problems are between those two hospitals, she should inform the House why they exist and explain the difference between Cavan and Mullingar so that we can do something about it, not just point out that there is a difference.</p>
            <p eId="para_68">One of the problems with Cavan General Hospital is that the surgeons are restricted in the work they can do.  There is no point sending seriously ill people to Cavan General Hospital if the surgeons there cannot operate on them.  Having a protocol insisting that every surgical patient from Monaghan goes to Cavan is nonsensical.  It does not take a medical professional, administrator or bureaucrat to work that out.  It is daft.</p>

            <p eId="para_69">I have substantially increased the capital funding available to the Health Service Executive this year.  Once I approve a capital programme, I do not try to find out how it is spent every week.  In light of the Teamwork report and given the decision made and endorsed by the Government that we will have a new, state-of-the-art hospital for the region, any decisions made about spending on capital projects or otherwise should fit in with that overall approach.  The region merits and has long deserved a state-of-the-art hospital.  In particular, the urgent developments that need to take place in Monaghan, Cavan, Drogheda and Navan will happen and the HSE will ensure they do so quickly.  Professor Brendan Drumm and his team are committed to making that happen quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_70">When we examine budgets and bed numbers in Mullingar and Cavan hospitals, the outputs are different.  This may be because of some of the issues raised by Deputy Twomey.  However, throughout the country we see wide variations and the purpose of reform is to try to have every hospital performing to the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness.  Mr. John O'Brien and his team at the National Hospitals Office are working hospital by hospital to try to bring that about.  The more hospitals learn from each other and work together, the sooner we will achieve that target.</p>

            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_72">A review of tertiary paediatric services carried out by McKinsey &amp; Company on behalf of the Health Service Executive recommended the establishment of a single tertiary paediatric hospital in Dublin, co-located with a leading adult academic hospital.  Subsequently, a joint HSE-Department of Health and Children task group was established to advise on the optimum location of the proposed new hospital.  The task group's report was submitted to the board of the HSE on 1 June last, and its recommendation that the new paediatric hospital be developed as an independent hospital on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital was endorsed by the board.  At its meeting on 8 June, the Government also strongly endorsed the recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">Neither the Taoiseach, I nor any other members of the Government had meetings or discussions with the task group during the course of its work.  I am satisfied that the task group undertook a rigorous and robust examination of the key issues in arriving at its recommendation.  To suggest that the decision was influenced by political considerations is an affront to the integrity of the members of the group.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">A joint HSE-Department of Health and Children transition group has since been established to advance the development of the new hospital.  Among the key items to be addressed are the definition of a high level framework brief for the new hospital and the determination of the scope and location of the urgent care centres.  I understand that the group intends to retain outside expertise to assist it in its work.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">I recently met representatives from Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and was informed that the hospital has commissioned its own report on the issues relating to the location of the national paediatric hospital.  I understand that the joint transition group received a copy of the report in recent days and that it is being examined.  A further meeting with the Crumlin representatives will take place when this process is complete.  The decision about the site for the new hospital has now been made and it is essential that all those involved focus on implementing that decision.  This is in the best interests of the children of this country.</p>

            <from>Ms McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_76">Does the Minister accept that there is a concern that the decision to locate the hospital on this site was politically influenced and that having looked at the site, there are serious questions over it?  For example, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children would transfer its services from a 15-acre site to one restricted to less than four acres to include all paediatric services.  The deal offered to the hospital will be on a flying leasehold under which the hospital would have no ownership or charge of anything underground, including the carparking.  Access is difficult and serious concerns have been raised in the report from Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, which I thought the Minister would have made it her business to see.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">Is the Minister saying she has not seen the report, or that neither she nor the Health Service Executive has received it?</p>

            <from>Ms McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_81">It will be important for the Minister to comment on it because the indications are that there are serious technical problems in terms of the leasehold, the site, access and services.  Is the Minister stating that Government policy is to have only one hospital and that the idea of two hospitals, north and south of the Liffey, is not, and will not be, Government policy?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_42" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_82">Before I became Minister for Health and Children I had given little consideration to paediatric services and knew little about them.  Since then, virtually every paediatrician I met in this city and around the country said we should bring the services together and have a state-of-the-art hospital.  We were planning to build a new hospital in Crumlin, probably on-site, and a new hospital for Temple Street Children's Hospital, and we have facilities in Beaumont, Tallaght and St. James's hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">McKinsey was commissioned to examine best practice around the world.  It studied approximately 17 countries and concluded the child population here merited only one tertiary facility bringing all the expertise together.  Furthermore, it said that because of the relatively small number of children who would require certain specialists these would have to be shared with adult services.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">When the McKinsey report was published last Christmas everybody signed up to it.  Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Temple Street Children's Hospital and Tallaght Hospital all regarded it as a good report and were optimistic.  The difficulty arose when the site selection began.  Several sites were examined.  I am not an expert in construction or hospitals but I have visited hospitals in the United States which are on small sites.  There are several in Manhattan and I recently saw one in Toronto.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">Although Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin is on a large site it does not fill the site.  Obviously the site must accommodate the hospital but the most important factor is what happens in the hospital.  I hope everyone will work to make the hospital a state-of-the-art, world class facility for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">The intention is to have one hospital for the country, not just Dublin.  Urgent care centres will be provided in at least one, if not more locations, and the group has been asked to examine how many of these centres are required.  Thankfully, these deal with 95% of the reasons children go to hospital in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">All those who tendered to have the hospital co-located, including St. James's, St. Vincent's, Beaumont, Tallaght and the Mater hospitals, offered sites.  That was the basis on which the decision was made and no problems arose about the site.  No ethos issues arose because this will be a State hospital.  It will not belong to the Mater Hospital, although there seems to be some confusion about that.  We will introduce legislation to ensure it is owned by the State.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_43">
            <from>Ms McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_88">That is not strictly true because the Mater Hospital will own the car park.  That is a significant factor for access for parents and children.  Does the Minister not accept that grave and serious concerns are being expressed by the authorities at St. James's Hospital, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin and Tallaght Hospital about the decision that has been made?  The Minister is saying she is not in a position to judge those concerns, but is she prepared to establish an independent review to assess the difficulties which have been highlighted and exposed in the analysis carried out by the hospitals?  It is important that we get this right.  It is quite clear there are concerns about political interference.  It is believed that problems will arise which will have a significant impact on patients.</p>

            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_89">I assure the Deputy there was no political interference — that is certain.  The group that has been established to make progress with this initiative, which comprises officials from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children, will examine the submission made by Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.  I accept there is disappointment in certain quarters.  When I met representatives of St. James's Hospital yesterday, they acknowledged during our very positive meeting that the decision has been made.  It is clear they want to work with those in the new hospital.  Many clinicians from St. James's Hospital are also working at Crumlin at present.  There is a great deal of expertise, for example in the burns unit.  Some specialist cancer services are based at St. James's Hospital.  It is important that those who work in such areas co-operate with the new hospital, as they want to do.  I do not want a situation of permanent review to develop because people are not happy with the decision that has been taken.  If there are real issues which make it physically impossible for the hospital to be located in the intended location, for whatever reason, that will be a different matter.  It is clear that it cannot happen in such circumstances.  I have been advised that is not the case, however.  The technical expertise available to me in the Department and to the HSE strongly suggests that is not the position.  We will certainly give some consideration to the submission that has been made by Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">I am aware the Irish Medical Organisation has, on behalf of junior hospital doctors, submitted a claim to the Public Service Benchmarking Body for a 20% pay increase.  The benchmarking body, which is independent, examines and reports on the pay of public service grades with reference to pay rates for similar types of employment in the private sector.  A media report has suggested that a similar claim may be submitted to the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector on behalf of consultants.  The review body, which is independent, examines and reports upon the remuneration of consultants and other senior public service grades.  In making its report, the review body is expected to have regard to the desirability of encouraging a high level of efficiency and effectiveness in the relevant areas.  The Health Service Executive and I are keen to ensure that any pay increases awarded by either body will reflect the level of co-operation by medical grades with the health reform programme.  A new contract for consultants and junior hospital doctors is a central element of that programme.</p>

            <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_92">When I attended the recent People of the Year awards, at which the Minister, Deputy Harney, spoke eloquently, I spoke to a consultant who expressed his view that the Minister's long-term aim is to introduce what he called "yellow pack" consultants, who would not be as well qualified as Irish consultants.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.  The consultant made the point that some young consultants who have returned from the United States are having difficulties in finding houses in Dublin and living in Dublin.  I ask the Minister to comment on his suggestion that media reports of consultants' huge salaries are often exaggerated.  Is the Minister aware of the interesting RTE documentary series, "Junior Doctors", which highlights the excessive hours worked by such doctors?  They work even harder than we do, which is saying a lot.  When we have been working for many hours we can go on auto pilot, but junior doctors have to make decisions of life and death in such circumstances.  Does the Minister agree they should be remunerated properly for all their work and responsibility?  Does she believe their hours should be cut, for the sake of patients?</p>
          </speech>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_47" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_93">I want to refute the term "yellow pack" consultants.  I do not know what that is supposed to mean.  I will not be appointing consultants; they will be appointed on the basis of their expertise.  In many countries, after a doctor is trained as a consultant, he or she then takes up a consulting position.  In Ireland one could be training for 20 years and never, unfortunately, be given a consulting position.  I am not suggesting that every junior hospital doctor or non-consulting doctor should become a consultant.  That is a decision I am not qualified to make nor should I make.</p>
            <p eId="para_94">A consultant's basic pay begins at €139,000, rising to €181,000.  On top of that, he or she will have allowances of about €22,000.  That is not an inconsiderable salary.  An academic consultant will be paid €222,000.  There is not much private practice for many consultants in specialties such as geriatrics and paediatrics.  In other areas, the opportunity for private practice, on top of the existing salary, exists.  The intention with the working time directive is to reduce working time for a junior doctor from 77 hours to 55 hours per week.  A junior hospital doctor receives almost the same pay as a consultant, particularly when one factors in overtime.  On a 55 hour week, the earnings of a senior house officer stand at €104,000 while those on the special register stand at €152,000.  We want fewer junior doctors in the health service.  We have 2,000 consultants but 4,000 is the figure we need to achieve in the next few years.  I hope we can have a new contract of employment that delivers flexibility and teamwork.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">I referred earlier to the clinical directorate.  Doctors are among the brightest and best educated of our graduates.  Their remuneration must reflect that, as it does in other countries.  This is not a question of saving money but of having flexibility and a contract of employment that suits our health care needs.  It cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution.  I want a range of different contracts that suit different circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_96">In many countries, a doctor working in a peripheral location will be offered a more lucrative salary than if working in a large centre of population.  I acknowledge the Deputy's comments on house prices.  There is no doubt, particularly in Dublin, Cork and some of the larger cities, it is a factor in attracting people home.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">Is it acceptable that five years after the Government's health strategy which promised a new consultants' contract talks leading to it have not even begun?  What is the Tánaiste's view on this?  Gabh mo leithscéal, I meant former Tánaiste.  Will she acknowledge that this Government, of which she is an integral part, and a succession of other Governments, have allowed an elite in the medical profession to enjoy a position of privilege unrivalled by any other sector in society?  Will she accept that her initiative of private hospitals being developed in public lands adjacent to existing public hospital sites is undermining the Government's negotiating position with the consultants' representatives?  Only yesterday, this was demonstrated by a spokesperson from the Irish Medical Organisation, Mr. George McNeice.  He asked why the Government will proceed to deal with category 2 contracts while allowing for the development of new private facilities adjacent to public hospital sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">What are the Minister's plans to stand up to these vested interests which perpetuate a piggybacking off our public health care system for their personal greed?  The people want to know what she intends to do about it.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_49" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_99">The Deputy need not apologise for calling me Tánaiste.  For the first two months when I had the job, I always thought it was Dick Spring was being referred to when the title was used.  It does get confusing.  I also remember the Taoiseach, on this side of the House, referring to John Bruton as Taoiseach.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">I do not share the Deputy's perspective on consultants.  What is needed with the consultant contract is flexibility and teamwork.  It may sound clichéd but we want consultants to deliver the services because they are the most experienced and competent in the business.  The category 1 contract allows doctors to engage in public and private practice in a public hospital.  Category 2 allows a doctor to have a private practice off-site in several hospitals.  I want doctors to be kept on hospital sites.  If a co-location facility exists on a hospital site and it fits in with a current category 1 contract, a doctor will be on-site and working in the facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">I am concerned that particular arrangements are in place for a public practice in a public hospital and to which a consultant will be committed.  It must also be measured and monitored so we get what we are paying for.  We get an excess of what we pay for from many doctors who work beyond the 11 sessions or 33 hours a week.  There are many difficulties with the current contracts and we could never negotiate such contracts again.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">I agree with the Deputy that it is disappointing new contracts have not been agreed.  The talks began and collapsed on two occasions.  I understand Mr. Connaughton, SC, the chairperson of these talks, is talking with both sides.  I hope this will have a successful outcome.  I saw many positives in Mr. McNeice's article yesterday.  I got the impression the IMO wants to return to the negotiating table.  I would welcome that and like to see it happen as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">It should be 58 hours.  I was wrong when I said 55 hours.  Agreement has been reached on nine pilot sites where this working time structure will be implemented.  It is, however, on hold pending the talks at the LRC and I cannot say when these will be completed.  The sooner, the better because no one wants junior hospital doctors working the hours they have to now.  It is neither good for them nor their patients.  The only way this can be reorganised is through agreement.  We cannot, however, be expected to pay 20% more for a substantially reduced working week.</p>

            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_108">Home care packages for older people deliver a wide range of services.  They are delivered through the Health Service Executive by a range of providers, including the Health Service Executive, voluntary groups and the private sector.  They consist of a mixture of grants, contracted care services, therapeutic input and equipment and other such community services to facilitate the older person to remain living in his or her home.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">Home care services provided directly by the Health Service Executive do not generally come within the scope of VAT, as public bodies are not regarded as taxable persons.  It does not charge VAT on the services it provides and cannot recover VAT incurred on its input costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">Where home care services are provided by private companies for a consideration in the course or furtherance of business, the provider may be obliged to register and account for VAT at the appropriate rate depending on the type of service provided.  Home care provided to individuals consists of services which may be liable to VAT at different rates.  The current VAT treatment of such services is in accordance with the EU Sixth VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">Officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the Health Service Executive are examining VAT liability for home care services provided by private companies to older people.  In particular, they are trying to ensure the home care services provided under home care packages are exempt from VAT in a manner that complies with EU law.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">The Government has made services for older people a priority.  This means supporting older people in dignity, to live in their own communities, for as long as possible.  Additional funding for services for older people and palliative care, amounting to €150 million, has been allocated in the 2006 budget.  This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people.  It is important to have a high quality of residential care available for those who require it and additional funding was also made available in the 2006 budget for the subvention scheme.</p>

            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_113">It is a national scandal that the State is failing to provide necessary services for older people.  Even though some must scrimp and save to support themselves in their homes, the Government cruelly imposes VAT on the companies providing care services.  These companies inevitably pass on this charge to the person who must pay to keep an elderly relative at home.  Such people are being unfairly doubly charged.  This points to the duplicity of the Government which, on one hand, encourages the private sector to provide services for older people which are its responsibility to provide, while, on the other hand, making it more difficult for older people to buy the service they are compelled to buy because the Government will not do so.  It is absolutely ludicrous.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">I am encouraged by the Minister of State's reply that he is reviewing the situation.  Will he remove this inequity immediately?  It is a crippling charge.  The Government is not providing adequate home care for people who require that service.  The available home care packages are limited.  In particular, those who are trying their best to keep older relatives at home must not only provide the cost of paying a private company to do what the State will not do but also face the further cost of the VAT that is cruelly taken by the Government on that charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">The Minister, Deputy Harney, encouraged these companies to provide these services, no doubt to satisfy the Progressive Democrats' private profit agenda.  No mention was initially made that VAT at 13.5% would be charged for those services.  Only those who are registered for VAT and have a VAT number, which is not the case for most of those looking after elderly relatives, can get that money back.  "Liveline" listeners were lining up to talk about this issue and they have a strong case.  I ask the Minister of State not merely to talk about reviewing the situation but to tell us whether the Government is committed to removing this inequitable charge.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">Will the Deputy let us know if he has a magic wand or is doing something we are not?  As I explained, the Government must comply with the relevant EU directive.  Officials from the Department and the HSE are working with the Revenue Commissioners and officials from the Department of Finance to see if there is some way to overcome the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">We appreciate the value of home care packages and the wonderful work that is being done in this area.  In last year's budget, the amount of money available for this service was almost trebled.  This resulted in an increase in the number of packages available from 1,100 in 2005 to 3,000 this year.  These services keep people out of hospitals and facilitate the early discharge of elderly patients.  They are provided by several providers, including the HSE.  We are keen to see a situation where this service could be provided VAT free, which would make it more affordable for families.  It would also mean the Government would be in a position to provide more home care packages.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">We showed our commitment in last year's budget which included a major investment in this service.  That investment will continue.</p>

            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_119">Does the Minister of State not agree this burden is too great for many people?  How can VAT be charged on this service when there are civil servants and others employed by the Government in the service who should be able to recognise the inequity of this charge?  The system is supposed to serve the people but seems rather to serve those who are making profits.  The interests of the latter appear to have the upper hand over the needs of the public.  It is wrong that a situation can arise whereby people are trying their best to pay for a service and must then face a second charge imposed by the Government.  How did such a situation come about, especially given the Government's encouragement of private companies to provide this service?  Is it part and parcel of the Government's role to act in this way or will we ever see a situation where people are put before profit?</p>

            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_120">It is not a matter of putting people before profit.  As I explained, home care packages are provided by several different bodies, some of which are private and one of which is the HSE.  The current VAT treatment of such services is in accordance with the EU's sixth VAT directive, with which we must comply.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_59">
            <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_121">The Minister of State is correct that we will all benefit from the home care packages if they serve to reduce the dependence on hospital beds.  It is important that people are confident that this is a solution for which they may opt.  Given that 13.5% of €150 million is in the region of €20 million, is the Department of Health and Children seeking to reclaim this money from the Department of Finance?  If not, this charge serves to reduce the funding that should be directed towards the home care package.  It is desirable that this amount should be further increased and the most important issue is that it covers the costs of the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">I am aware there are delays in payments under this scheme.  I have dealt with several people who have had to get loans to cover the first two months before the payment comes through.  This is a particular difficulty for persons on the low end of the income scale.  These problems must be resolved if this service is to be an option for people across the spectrum.  The VAT charge should be repaid from the Department of Finance to the Department of Health and Children so that the funding of €150 million is not reduced by 13.5%.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanPower" eId="spk_60" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_123">We are developing a much more flexible approach in dealing with home care packages.  In some instances, people are given the money when they can provide the required service themselves.  We have entered into discussions, as I outlined already, with the view to reaching a situation where this service can be provided without VAT.  If we can do so, we will be in a position to provide a far greater number of home care packages throughout the country.  As I mentioned, we have already increased the availability from 1,100 last year to 3,000 in 2006.  In the first six months of this year, an additional 1,800 clients became in receipt of home care packages.</p>
            <p eId="para_124">I will investigate what Deputy Murphy said about delays in payments and respond to those concerns at a later date.  I appreciate the difficulty such delays would cause.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_61">
            <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
            <p eId="para_125">It is obvious patients are not getting a fair deal on this issue.  From the perspective of the taxpayer, if the Government is spending this amount of money, a cost benefit analysis should have been done.  Does the Minister of State know how much it costs the HSE to provide each home care package?  Taking into consideration a 25% premium, which comprises the VAT and the profit of the private company at a minimum, is the Minister of State saying private companies can deliver the same quality and type of service at a lower rate than what it would cost the HSE to hire home helps to provide exactly the same service?  According to the Government's value for money audits, there is an obligation on the Department to undertake such an analysis to ensure it is getting the best value for the taxpayers' money.  Has this been done or is there an intention to do so?</p>
            <p eId="para_126">There is no way around the VAT issue because its imposition is necessitated by an EU directive.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has not managed to do it when answering parliamentary questions in this House and it is highly unlikely anybody else will come up with a solution.  Has the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power, ever done a cost benefit analysis on this issue comparing private sector delivery of this service with that of the Health Service Executive?</p>

            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_127">We had a number of pilot projects throughout the country providing these home care packages and the feedback suggested they worked exceptionally well.  We decided, on that basis, to increase our investment from 1,100 to 3,000 home care packages throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">The Health Service Executive and also the private sector provide this service and competition must be welcomed in this area.  In some cases the private sector may provide a more flexible service.  It is important that we continue to invest in this and if we reach a point where this service can be provided VAT free, all the better and all the more money we will have to spend to provide home care packages for more people throughout the country.</p>

            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_133">The Health Service Executive has confirmed the position in relation to the company in question to be as follows.  The company is a major supplier of information technology systems to the health services in Ireland, the UK and several other countries.  Financial difficulties at the company, combined with changes at senior management level and staff lay-offs in the UK have been widely reported during the course of this year.  Although the company's latest financial results for the year ended April 2006 reported a significant net loss, it made an operating profit on revenues for the year.  The net loss was primarily attributable to a substantial goodwill impairment charge associated with the goodwill valuation attributed to a company it merged with three years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">The company's difficulties in the UK have not impacted on services to Irish customers.  The company has met its contractual obligations to the HSE and has advised that it will continue to do so.  The company supports many IT systems that have been in place for years in various hospitals in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">The HSE awarded the national contract for new hospital systems to the company in 2005.  The total ten-year value of the contract is €56 million plus VAT.  Under this contract, phase one of the roll-out of the company's existing hospital software, which will meet HSE requirements for the short to medium term, is under way.  The system has been successfully deployed in Cork and Kerry and is expected to be implemented in hospitals in the north west and north east over the next few months.  A total of €11.6 million, including VAT, has been paid to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">The national contract also entitles the HSE to deploy the new software that the company will develop over the coming years.  Further engagement with the company is planned in the near future to determine the implications for the HSE of the company's revised software development programme arising from the difficulties the company has experienced in the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">The HSE is confident that the contract protects its position appropriately against poor performance and non-delivery of software and services.  The contract was prepared by the HSE's legal advisers and explicit provision was made to protect the HSE against a series of eventualities.  Payments to the company under the contract are dependent upon the receipt of identified deliverables.  The contract also provides for financial remedies in the form of payments to the HSE to deal with possible problems with quality, performance and-or availability of software or with the quality, responsiveness and availability of support services.</p>

            <from>Ms McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_138">Is the Minister for Health and Children not concerned that the UK company we are discussing has declared a net loss of €500 million?  Is she suggesting that not only has this company been paid for services, she intends to complete the contract with a €59 million payment without expressing concerns about the current situation?  The company's chief executive officer has resigned and there has been a late declaration of an enormous loss.  There are major concerns in Britain's National Health Service regarding the possibility of this company delivering services.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">I acknowledge the change of status of the Minister for Health and Children and acknowledge also that she is one of the very few women Members of the House and is unique in having led a political party and having been Tánaiste.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">I thank Deputy McManus for her kind comments.  One would be concerned when we have contractual arrangements with any company that gets into difficulties, but the banks, in the case of this company, have reconfirmed the borrowings and that is encouraging.  The HSE believes that its legal position is protected.  As the company has a major contract with the NHS, we therefore believe that if it were not in a position to continue, its products would be taken over by a competitor and the services would continue to be supplied.  The HSE remains confident that the company can continue its contractual obligations.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">In anticipation that Leaders' Questions may deal with current issues arising from disclosures concerning the Mahon tribunal, I am allowing questions today on the same basis as 10 February 2004.  I will make a brief statement on the application of Standing Order 56 which deals with matters <i>sub judice</i> and sets out, as far as the Dáil is concerned, the delicate balance between this House and the courts and judicial tribunals in their respective functions.  The relevant part of the Standing Order states: “a matter shall not be raised in such an overt manner that it appears to be an attempt by the Dáil to encroach on the functions of the Courts or a Judicial Tribunal”.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">On 10 February 2004 I made a ruling allowing matters relating to the Mahon tribunal to be discussed on the basis of the then particular circumstances.  That application of the Standing Order depends, to some degree, on timing and the type of Dáil discussion.  The House finds itself in a somewhat similar situation today and I am allowing the matter be discussed in the given circumstances without prejudice to any decision the Chair may be required to make in the future.  However, in doing so, Members should bear in mind when contributing that while these matters are now in the public domain, the Mahon tribunal saw fit to correspond with the media concerning issues surrounding confidentiality.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">In addition, the normal rules of debate shall apply.  Serious allegations against a Member can only be made by way of substantive motion and references should not be made to the private family matters of another Member.  I ask for Members' co-operation in these matters.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_144">I will abide by the Ceann Comhairle's ruling.  The House meets today in extraordinary circumstances following an admission by the Taoiseach yesterday on national television that when he was Minister for Finance, he accepted €50,000 in donations.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">The Office of Taoiseach is the most powerful political office in the land.  It is one that should be respected by, have the confidence of and exercise its authority in the interests of the people.  Its occupant should be above suspicion and the people expect his or her honour to be absolutely above reproach.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">In the past week, the Office of Taoiseach has been damaged.  It is wrong that a litany of the Taoiseach's colleagues at ministerial level have sought to deflect from the fundamental issue by drawing in emotional and traumatic circumstances the Taoiseach went through a number of years ago.  Around 100,000 men and women have gone through the same traumatic experience.  No Member on this side of the House has sought, by comment or otherwise, to draw any of the implications of this into this debate.  Yesterday was a difficult day for the Taoiseach and I appreciate that.  As I said, there are 100,000 others who have had similar experiences.  The issue involved in last night's interview is not simply a matter of ethics, morality, codes or legislation.  It is a fundamental principle, the simple issue of right and wrong.  It is what we try to teach and instil in our children.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">I wish to ask the Taoiseach two very simple questions.  When he looks at the acceptance of €50,000 in cash donations, the appointments and the statements he made in this House about probity, perspective and not being beholden to business people financially, can the Taoiseach explain to me and to the nation how he is prepared to apply standards to himself that he is not prepared to apply to everybody else?  Why is the standard applied to himself lower than it is for anybody else?</p>
          <p eId="para_148">In view of the Taoiseach's interview yesterday, is he prepared to stand in this House, from the honoured seat he occupies, and admit that what he did in accepting €50,000 in cash donations was wrong?  Is he prepared to say to the people, "Yes, I was wrong"?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_149">I thank the Ceann Comhairle and will try to be as brief as I can.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">I come to the House with the belief that the truth is certainly more powerful than the most baseless of political attacks.  I intend to address private issues here today, frankly and fully, even though I believe they have nothing to do with my public responsibilities, have never influenced me on any public policy and represent absolutely no conflict of interest.  I will answer charges which were made, based on what I believe were calculated and scurrilous leaks of material given to a tribunal in confidence.  I will talk plainly about what are personal, sensitive matters that properly concern my family and my private life.  I acknowledge what Deputy Kenny has said in that regard.  I do all this because a person, or persons, accessed confidential material before a tribunal and twisted and turned that material into a political smear campaign with no regard for the truth or the institutions that govern our society.  I do it, in the end, to protect the rights of every citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">Before I deal with the facts at hand, I want everyone in this House and all the people of this nation to understand one truth above all else.  Never, in all the time I have served in public life, have I taken a bribe or in any way put my personal interest ahead of the public good.  I have served this State honestly and I defy anyone to prove otherwise.  For many years I have endured all sorts of allegations that have proven to be false.  Perhaps this is part of the price one must pay for the honour of standing in the House as Taoiseach and of serving in Government and I understand that.  I have never dishonoured any office in my responsibility, in answer to Deputy Kenny's question.  While I will be the first to admit I have made mistakes in my life and career, one mistake I have never made, and never will make, is to enrich myself by abusing or misusing the trust the people of this nation have placed in me.  The Flood — now Mahon — and Moriarty tribunals were set up to investigate corruption in our planning and political processes.  Following on from the McCracken tribunal and its revelations, the Government, of which I was Taoiseach and on my insistence, determined to get to the bottom of controversies in our planning and political processes.  Our resolve was clear and our policy was plain.  A thorough investigation would purge our system of wrongdoing.  Nine years on, the Moriarty tribunal is coming to a conclusion and its report is imminent.  The Mahon tribunal continues with its work.  I have supported and assisted both tribunals at all times.  I have provided all documentation requested, sworn affidavits, given statements of evidence and had no difficulty with this.  It is my duty.  I see it as my duty to co-operate and have done so.  I have willingly contributed to inquiries that helped to end the corrupt practices of the past which damaged confidence and trust in our political system.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">In setting up the tribunals, I do not believe any of us foresaw that some would debase their roles by deploying them as instruments for making false, malicious and baseless allegations.  That kind of cynical manipulation and smear campaigning can be as damaging to our political system as actual corruption.  It creates an atmosphere where all politicians are tarnished and trust in our institutions is eroded.  I personally have been the subject of a series of lurid allegations, which somebody referred to today as being "very colourful".  They might be colourful, but I gave all the facts about my life, including my personal life, in order to prove that these allegations were untrue.  Other issues arose and I accept that but allegations were made that I took a bribe of €50,000 from Denis ‘Starry' O'Brien.</p>

          <p eId="para_156">The Denis ‘Starry' O'Brien allegation is well known.  It was also alleged that I received a further bribe of €30,000 from Owen O'Callaghan in 1992, that I had bank accounts in the Netherlands Antilles, Liechtenstein and Jersey, England, that I had €15 million in onshore accounts and had taken steps to open a bank account in Mauritius.  There were other similar, unfounded, allegations made against me which have not yet been made public.  Each and every one of these charges is baseless.  They are false and no more than a tissue of lies.  However, the allegations have been made and the tribunal is required to investigate them, in so far as they fall within its terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">Those who have made the allegations have gone to extraordinary lengths to set me up.  For example, a forged letter purporting to show that I had taken steps to open a bank account in Mauritius was sent to the Moriarty tribunal.  I can confirm that correspondence was subsequently forwarded to the tribunal which demonstrates the letter to be a forgery.  In any view of the situation, the forwarding of the forgery is a sinister event.  Likewise, the recent leaking of confidential details about my finances, family and marital life are also very sinister and has been done in a calculated way in order to damage me.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Deputy Kenny asked me about the issues of 1993 and 1994.  I gave the full details of those yesterday.  They did not break any law.  They did not break any tax law.  The Deputy asked if I should have left the loans the way I had them and not listened to friends who were trying to be helpful.  I suppose if hindsight was foresight, one would never make any mistakes at all.  I did accept them but they were loans given to me in good faith, to be of assistance to me at the time.  If the Deputy asked me if it were today, after all that has happened over the years, and I was in a similar position, the answer to his question is no.  But the reality is that at the time, I was in a difficult position.  They put pressure on me to accept these donations and I did.  I only accepted them, after some considerable time, as loans with interest.  I knew what the position was and what the law is and that is why I accepted them.  I gave the full details yesterday.  I can go through all of that again if the Deputy wishes.</p>

          <p eId="para_159">That is precisely what is wrong with Irish politics and what breeds the cynicism we have.  I did not make any lurid allegations against the Taoiseach.  I did not ask him about any of the details of 1993 or 1994.  I asked him two fundamental questions, neither of which he has answered.  Can he explain to the Irish people how he applies a different standard to everybody else than he applies to himself?  He stood up and quite rightly accepted the McCracken tribunal report.  He spoke, knowing in his heart, mind and soul that he was the recipient of €50,000 in cash donations.  He told everybody in the nation at large that this should not apply in the case of public representatives.  How can he explain that he applies a standard to himself that is different to that applied to everyone else?</p>
          <p eId="para_160">Is the Taoiseach not man enough to stand up and say, "Yes, I was wrong"?  Double standards were applied here.  He knew he was in receipt of those donations but did not regularise the position after he became Taoiseach, the most powerful office in the land.  One does not need legislation on a matter of conscience.  One knows it is either right or wrong.  One does not need any code of morality or ethics.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to admit that the acceptance of €50,000 in cash donations by him was wrong?</p>
          <p eId="para_161">I listened to a number of Ministers — Deputies Hanafin, O'Dea, O'Donoghue, Roche and Brennan — all refuse to answer the question as to whether they considered the Taoiseach was wrong.  Nobody on that side of the House is prepared to accept any responsibility.  Nobody is prepared to say, "Yes, this was wrong" or "I admit I was wrong" and from the new Tánaiste, the silence is deafening.  Nobody accepts responsibility or accountability and that is what diminishes the status of the Taoiseach's office, the highest in the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">The Taoiseach spoke last night about receiving "£8,000" at a function in Manchester.  As I understand the green book that applies to ministerial responsibility, it is strictly and completely forbidden to accept any donations or pecuniary reward for personal use, as a Minister.  It seems as if, in that confused statement, the Taoiseach was using the office — if he was a Minister at the time — as some kind of nixer for reward and that should not be.  In that respect, was that money paid in sterling, punts or euro?  Was the Taoiseach a Minister in Cabinet at the time?  Did he pay tax on this money and were any of the Cabinet rules breached by virtue of the fact that he received it?</p>
          <p eId="para_163">There are three fundamental issues.  How does the Taoiseach apply different standards to himself than to everybody else?  Is he prepared to admit that what he did was wrong?  Will he deal with the issue of the moneys received by him at the Manchester function?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_164">On the first question, Deputy Kenny has it wrong.  He used the term "cash donations" but I did not receive any cash donations.  I accepted money reluctantly on the basis that it was a loan to be repaid with interest.  It would have been entirely wrong to accept a donation and I did not accept the money as a donation.  I took it as a loan to be paid back and I said I would have to pay interest on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">I would have paid the money back a number of years ago because I had accumulated certain moneys and my adviser had told me how I should do it, but, as I believe the Deputy will know, it is a number of years since some of these issues were raised with me.  I assume that if I had paid them back, I would have been accused of doing so only because the matter had been raised, although I never believed these issues would become public matters because I was assured of confidentiality.  However, one should remember that if I had been assured someone would say I paid back the moneys only because the issue had been raised, I would not have been in a position to do so almost until these issues became known.  However, the moneys were loans to be paid back with interest and it was on that basis that I took them.  That was the position throughout the entire period.  There was no other issue and that has been well documented with the tribunal and with the people involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">My friends had asked to have a function to raise the money for me.  There is no tax implication because it was a loan to be repaid with interest.  That was the very clear position I had established with my colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">Deputy Kenny's second question was whether it is wise for a politician, in any circumstances and under any skies, to take any kind of money on any basis from anyone.  The laws provide distinctly for one to do so.  They provide for one's friends or one's family.  There are many ways to do that.  There are benefits applied to people's families for a range of reasons.  There are benefits if one lives on the land and a range of other benefits and that is why the legislation is written the way it is.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Of course it can be made look wrong, as demonstrated by the carefully calculated leaks a week before the Dáil resumed which placed me in my current position.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">It was not wrong and I gave freely the information not to prove that the transaction was right or wrong but to prove that other accusations about me, such as my having money in certain locations, were unfounded.  I will not go back over them.  That was the purpose of what I was doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">I believe it is well known in the House that I have, for many years, been very closely associated with a number of organisations in Manchester.  I have attended functions and spoken there.  While in Government, out of Government and as a backbencher, I been involved with St. Patrick's Day events, charity groups, the Dublin Association and the Irish World Heritage Centre.  I have spoken at many functions.  There are a good few business groups in Manchester and I believe I have spoken to them all.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">What I said yesterday was for completeness.  When some of these issues arose, I went through my records dating back to 1977.  I did not go back to the period of the tribunals.  I went through all my personal records dating back to 1977, in addition to my wife's and children's personal records.  I am not saying this to elicit sympathy — it is a fact that I was asked to do it.  I had to do it and I went back even further.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">The only other time I was in receipt of anything was when I was given a sum of money by a group in Manchester on a particular occasion attended by about 25 people.  I dealt with this properly in terms of taxes.  It had nothing in particular to do with the present matter at all but I did not want somebody to come out again and say I had got this particular sum of money.  That was the only point I made on that particular issue.  That was in 1994.  I checked the date and believe it was the 1994-95 season.  Subject to correction, I believe I was Minister at the time.  That is what that was about — there was no other issue.  When I went through all my other records dating from 1977, I noted that was the only other donation I was not able to account for out of literally hundreds of cheques and records dating back 29 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">These issues with the tribunal, pertaining to me, have now gone on for seven years.  I have carefully gone back through and taken advice on all of these records over seven years.  That is the context and it has nothing in particular to do with these issues.  I believe that answers Deputy Kenny's three questions.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_173">I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will agree it was difficult to watch the interview last night and it must have been particularly difficult for the Taoiseach to give it.  Nobody wants to intrude into the domestic or family affairs of any member of the House and nobody on these benches has ever mentioned the Taoiseach's personal life, let alone probed it.  It would be helpful in clarifying the matter if this were acknowledged.  It would be helpful if we could set it aside because we are not interested in the Taoiseach's private life.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">The leak may well have been for the vindictive motivation that the Taoiseach says it was for.  All I can say is that nobody on these benches is responsible for it.  We did not know the information.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">It would also be helpful in achieving clarity if there were a little less of the common man routine.  It is a long time since the Taoiseach was a common man.  He has been driven around this country since 1987 and he never put his hand in his pocket at a forecourt to fill the car with petrol.  He is earning more than €250,000 per annum and therefore there is no point in comparing himself to the man on Hill 16 who got into a bit of trouble and had a whip-round.  Mr. Haughey's collection started with a whip-round also and it was purely an accident that the matter entered the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">The issue in question is the Taoiseach's acceptance, for personal use, of €50,000.  He said <i>The Irish Times</i> was off the wall but it was not in that it referred to a figure between €50,000 to €100,000.  It is important that the Taoiseach now take this opportunity to clarify whether there is any more money.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">We now have standards in law and practice.  The Taoiseach himself has interpreted them before this House for officeholders and Members.  He said no Member of the House and certainly no officeholder should accept money that places him or her under any financial obligation.  Why does the Taoiseach believe he can articulate standards for the rest of the Members of this House while not having to comply with them himself?  He said that moneys he accepted in 1993, amounting to €50,000 and which have not been paid back 13 years later, and on which no interest was discharged, comprise a loan.  However, when it was suggested during the Deputy Lowry affair that the money in question might have been a loan, the Taoiseach said he would require incontrovertible written evidence of that arrangement and the amount of the repayments at the time.  Why would the Taoiseach apply this standard to Deputy Lowry and not to himself?  Is he telling the House that he, as a former Minister for Finance and accountant, committed no aspect of the arrangement in question to paper?</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Is there any written evidence that the people in question gave the Taoiseach the money?  Was the arrangement scribbled on the back of a beer mat when the transaction transpired?  Why is it that standards the Taoiseach articulated in the House at the time of the McCracken report and the Haughey, Ray Burke, and Michael Lowry affairs, as well as in the case of the former junior Minister, Deputy Callely, are articulated for others, but he now comes in here to tell us, that he, the most senior office-holder in the land does not have to comply with those same standards?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_179">These events took place some years before publication of the McCracken report.  However, the procedures I followed, the actions I have now taken and what I have told the tribunal and the public yesterday and today breach neither the ethics code, the tax code, nor legislation.  I am sure Deputy Rabbitte, like others, has examined the position very carefully and has not found that to be the case.  As I said to Deputy Kenny, I accepted those moneys on the basis that they were loans to be repaid with interest.  They would have been repaid before now but I had some difficulty in getting friends to accept that.  However, they realise that it has created more difficulty for me now than if they had accepted repayment.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">The help I received from personal friends on the basis that loans would be repaid with interest was no more than that.  They came to my aid at a certain point in my life.  They were friends, and I had known each individual for many years.  At no time did I do them any favours; nor was I beholden to them in any fashion.  I do not wish to draw distinctions between my actions and those of another Member, but I had no business connections with any of those people.  None of my businesses had any association with any of theirs, something fairly evident, since I have never had any businesses.  However, the cases are different, since I could not have benefited or gained in any way from any of those individuals.  I do not say that to point up others' difficulties.  The loans were based on the understanding that I would repay them.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">The standards Members are obliged to meet are those in the very tight legislation we drew up over several years.  Even today, nothing of what I have put into the public domain or told the tribunals over the years breached any of those guidelines.  I ask no one to be purer than legislative guidelines placed before this House.  I did not break the rules of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  I checked the matter with senior counsel and the tax authorities long ago, since I was involved in such issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">On Deputy Rabbitte's first two points, I do not want to take issue with <i>The Irish Times</i>, which is a newspaper of high standing.  I served it well on every publication day from Thursday to Wednesday, being able to fill headlines, as I will probably also do tomorrow.  I have no reason to get into a row with it that I would probably lose.  I have checked the text and what its eminent journalists said.  On the first morning, when I was in Clare, it very precisely stated that four people had given me between IR£50,000 and IR£100,000 in December 1993.  Yesterday I proved that the sum was IR£22,500.  That is my only point, but its comparison was with that figure.  I put all the other issues into the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I accept Deputy Rabbitte's point about his party having had nothing to do with the leaks and or anything to do with making my personal life more difficult.  No one in politics or among the public, other than a few organisations gave me a rough time when my wife and I first separated.  I do not suggest that anyone in this House has ever been unfair to me in that regard and I appreciate that.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_184">The Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, was the boss of the Revenue at the time.  Did he seek and receive clearance from the Revenue that he can say that he has no tax liability?  A loan not repaid after 13 years, with an express refusal to accept repayment in the case of certain donors, is a gift with tax implications.  Did he get clearance?  If the payments constituted loans, what does the Taoiseach calculate that he now owes?  What was the rate of compound interest, and how much is now outstanding?</p>
          <p eId="para_185">On the question of accepting €50,000, surely that breached the ministerial code of conduct even then.  The Taoiseach has spoken of Mauritius and other outrageous allegations made against him that I am certain are entirely baseless.  It reminds me of his statement last night that he had no bank account between 1987 and 1994.  Is he telling the House that when he was Minister for Finance and responsible for running the country's Exchequer he had no bank account in the jurisdiction?  Did he have one outside the jurisdiction, or was there no bank account during that entire period?</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Perhaps the Taoiseach might be specific about the Manchester event.  Was there a series of such events but a single payment?  He referred in the interview to his having paid capital gains and gift tax, but he did not say on what he had paid it or why it was liable.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">I know the law, although I am not an expert on every aspect.  However, many years ago my tax advisers checked the issues in detail on the basis that it was a loan with interest.  Subject to correction, I believe that the rate throughout the loan period was 3% — the interest rate that a person would have received on a deposit from 1993 or 1994.  It was calculated yearly, and the total interest would be more than €20,000.  I receive an annual figure from my tax adviser.  It was calculated over the entire period on that basis.  I paid capital gains tax and gift tax.  It is not appropriate for me to spell out what I paid, but I assure the Deputy that I did so following advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">I do not think Deputy Rabbitte means me to answer this question, but I must respond factually, since it is a fair question.  I was involved in separation proceedings at the beginning of 1987, and they did not conclude until the end of 1993 in the High Court.  Over that period, my wife and I had joint accounts in our names.  For obvious reasons, I did not use our joint account.  I used cheques separately to deal with issues, and I did not open an account in my own name until afterwards.  I hope that is clear.  The question was asked, so I have to answer it.  In Manchester, as I said, I dealt with a range of issues, but that was the particular one, namely, my taxes.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">At every hand's turn the Taoiseach has facilitated the powerful and the very wealthy.  Therefore it is no surprise that wealthy businessmen should cough up €50,000 to him.  What is shocking is that the Taoiseach still apparently does not see that a Minister for Finance taking large amounts of cash from businessmen is by any objective yardstick a massive conflict of interest.  The Taoiseach minimises the amount of money, but in 1993 the average industrial wage was €13,416 per year, so that three times that amount, by any ordinary worker's standard, would be colossal.  By coincidence, two years after that I bought a semi-detached home for €47,000 with a mortgage that goes on until I am 65.  At no stage should the Taoiseach have brought his personal life or difficulties into this issue.  It is not relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Again last night, deliberately, he cast RTE's Brian Dobson in the role of agony aunt in order to divert attention from the critical issues which he is refusing to answer.  The Taoiseach's personal circumstances are irrelevant because he said, last night, that he had already got a bank loan to pay off pressing bills, that they were taken care of.  Presumably he had a schedule of repayments to the bank.  He then used what he says were personal loans to pay off the bank loan.  Can he explain that conundrum to the House?</p>
          <p eId="para_193">When the Taoiseach was in the Dáil in 1997 setting up tribunals on payments to politicians, it beggars belief that the alarm bells that should have been going off in his head were not so deafening as——</p>

          <p eId="para_195">——to tell him to pay back the €50,000.  It was at the very least a catastrophic failure of political judgment.  It further beggars belief that he could not give it back.  Did the Taoiseach ever hear of a bank draft?  This morning it took me two minutes to draft the letter the Taoiseach could send with it:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_196">Ah Jaysus lads, you'll have me in huge trouble if you don't take back the €50,000.  My circumstances are improved and I'll have 50 reporters traipsing after me for the rest of my life if this comes out.  Bertie.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">It was as simple as that.  Perhaps he might have said: "P.S.  Tell Paddy the plasterer to steer clear of Callely's house.  He is in enough trouble with the painter already."</p>
          <p eId="para_198">A senior Minister gets substantial amounts of money from wealthy people.  Half of them are subsequently lifted into influential positions on prestigious State bodies.  What would any objective assessment of that be in any jurisdiction?  That was nauseous patronage and cronyism.  Incredibly, the Taoiseach blocked it out last night: the appointments were not because they gave him money but because they were his friends.  That is just as bad.  Can he not understand that appointing cronies to State boards because they are friends is the most despicable abuse of the State and of public bodies?</p>

          <p eId="para_203">As I said earlier, these were loans with interest, not from businessmen but friends.  My friends have been described as businessmen but the impression given that they are captains of industry is far from the truth.  They are people who assisted me at a particular time because they knew the circumstances.  I accepted that only on the basis these were loans with interest.  That is the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Every person appointed to a State board whether by myself or my colleagues is someone we believe is qualified for such an appointment.  They are appointments based on merit taking into account the particular combination of skills, qualifications, background and life experience that each person has.  Over a long political career I know a great many people who have been appointed to key boards.  I knew these people.  They had relevant skills and experience.  Three of the five had served on State boards long before they gave me any loan.  The other two could be considered under any fair examination to be outstanding people who served the State well on these boards.  I do not accept the position outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Deputy Joe Higgins can make the point that all of this is a bit of fun.  I do not see it as a bit of fun but as a serious issue.  As regards paying them back and how, he could be right in saying that I should have paid them back.  Perhaps I should have just paid them back and not worried how it would be interpreted, although I had taken the initiative of giving documentation to the tribunals.  I should have been able to say that I had paid them back over several years.  I did not do it that way because I thought that would be seen as just doing it at that particular time.  I followed the advice I got to the effect that these matters could not come out, and that I should keep the interest and the paperwork up to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Deputy Rabbitte asked me earlier whether there was documentation on the circumstances of these loans from the individuals concerned.  There is comprehensive documentation and it is with the tribunal as well.  On the issue of the Deutsche Bank and the forgery, the tribunals, I believe, have finished with that matter.  I mention it because again, it was a sinister act to try to set me up by suggesting I had extensive accounts.  I am not making a point about it, however it shows the things one has to try and deal with.  That is why I dealt with the tribunals so comprehensively.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">I do not think it is a bit of fun, but sometimes one has to resort to ridicule to show the untenable position the Taoiseach is holding onto with his explanations.  The Taoiseach is not the only person who has to offer an explanation to the House.  In the face of patronage, cronyism and double standards we have the Trappist-like silence from the Tánaiste and leader of the Progressive Democrats.  In a previous life in Opposition, one can only imagine the fulminations that would rain down from on high on the Taoiseach's head from Deputy McDowell as regards these issues.  To say he would become beetroot red is really only a pallid description of the shade of crimson verging on purple which would describe the glow irradiating from the indignant persona of Deputy McDowell.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">Far from standing up for standards, he is sitting neatly beside the Taoiseach today.  Admittedly, his demeanour is rather tombstone like, without the moonlight even.  However, since his appointment two weeks ago, Deputy McDowell is trying to work hard to have us believe he has no previous history in Government, that he has not been in Government for ten years, and that he has no responsibility for the billions of euro in stamp duty and the rest.  He wants us to believe he is a political newborn, dropped by a stork, perhaps, into a basket outside Government Buildings two weeks ago, with Deputy O'Donnell playing along as the besotted nurse fetchingly referring to him as Michael, if one does not mind.  That is somewhat different from the name she was spitting out two months ago from behind clenched teeth, when Michael was trying to take the PD rattler from Mary.  What has the Tánaiste said to the Taoiseach about this and will he make a statement?</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The image which Fianna Fáil has carefully cultivated of the Taoiseach, who is on €250,000 per annum, is that of an ordinary, struggling man like the rest of the ordinary people out there.  This image has taken a fierce battering.  Ordinary people do not have wealthy friends to do a whip around and the myth that Fianna Fáil is somehow the ordinary working person's party will hopefully end with this episode, where rich people come to the assistance of senior politicians.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">As I said a number of times, these people are friends.  If the Deputy wants to categorise people who are friends, that is his entitlement, but it is not an offence to get loans from friends at times.  I did that one time in my 55 years on this earth.  If in hindsight that was not the wisest thing to do, so be it, but I think there are few of us in this House who have not benefited from friendship at times, particularly in times of difficulty.  I have broken no laws and have violated no ethical codes.  I have co-operated fully with tribunals that are there to make findings of fact.  Other circumstances are used to put out half-truths, exaggerations and claims.  I made it very clear what I did and did not do, and I did so many years ago under the confidentiality of tribunals to show that I had nothing to do with any of the issues that I was accused of doing.  People are well aware of what has been stated about me over a number of years.  I would not wish that people in this House would have to go through the same process I have had to go through in the past eight or nine years to prove that I had no hand, act or part in any of the serious allegations that have been pressed against me, but time will see that right.</p>

            <p eId="para_247">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 32, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_248">On 29 June 2006, the British Prime Minister and I met at Stormont with the Northern Ireland political parties to discuss plans to restore the democratic institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  This meeting allowed a timely opportunity to assess the work done since the recall of the Assembly on 15 May.  The two Governments emphasised the need for intensified and accelerated engagement between the parties in view of the deadline of 24 November.  The work plan which we published following the meeting set out an indicative timescale for full restoration of the institutions.  We urged the parties to use the summer to consult with their members and communities on the way forward and to weigh in the balance any outstanding issues and any lingering mistrust against the prospect of losing devolution for another generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_249">I welcome the work done since then by the Preparation for Government committee, which continued to meet over the summer.  I hope the committee's work can provide the basis for reaching agreement on a range of issues relevant to the restoration of the institutions.  The two Governments want to see restoration of all the institutions created by the Good Friday Agreement as soon as possible and in any event by 24 November.  This is a considered, reasonable and fixed deadline.  We will do everything in our power to help achieve this.  There are ongoing contacts with the Northern Ireland political parties and I expect these to intensify over the coming period.</p>
            <p eId="para_250">A continuing absence of the Executive and Assembly is not sustainable.  It is time for elected politicians to take responsibility and they will have the opportunity to do so over the coming weeks.  I believe that if the political will is there, it should be possible to address satisfactorily all outstanding issues in the time available, for Northern Ireland to settle down and for its parties to share power on the basis of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_251">The close partnership and engagement between the two Governments continues to be a vital part of the process and I welcomed the opportunity to meet again with the Prime Minister on 15 September at Chequers.  We availed of this meeting to review our joint strategy for the restoration of the institutions.  In this context, we agreed that we would meet together with the parties in Scotland from 11 to 13 October.  In the meantime, we expect to receive a further report from the IMC in the near future.  This report is due to be published next week.  The most recent report from the IMC on normalisation, published earlier this month, was very encouraging and I hope that its October report will enhance confidence further.  I hope the peaceful and calm marching season will also give a boost to constructive political engagement and agreement  in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_252">At our meeting on 6 April, we made it clear that we would work on new British-Irish partnership arrangements to ensure our effective joint stewardship of the Good Friday Agreement in the event that devolution does not take place by 24 November.  This work is ongoing.  In our statement at the end of the meeting with the parties in June, Prime Minister Blair and I indicated that we would meet in December to announce details of these arrangements, should this be necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_253">We remain in close contact with the United States Administration, whose ongoing support for the process is deeply appreciated and remains invaluable.  I expect that my next visit to the United States will be in March 2007 to mark St. Patrick's Day.  It has been the practice in recent years to meet the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board over the St. Patrick's Day period and I expect to do so again next year.  My Department maintains contact with the board primarily through our embassy in Washington, as well as through annual visits and meetings.  As the House will be aware, board members give voluntarily of their time and expertise in a number of ways.  I welcome and greatly appreciate their ongoing advice and support.  I received a courtesy call from the Governor of Florida, Mr. Jeb Bush, on 21 July.  Our discussion covered a range of topics, including business issues, tourism and the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_254">On 13 July 2006, I met representatives of the Ulster Political Research Group.  They outlined their proposal for a conflict transformation initiative in loyalist areas.  The meeting was positive and focused.  I welcome the ongoing efforts to bring about a genuine transformation in loyalism.  The British Government recently approved funding for a pilot project to develop this initiative.  I assured the group that the focus and priority of the Irish Government, whatever the outcome of the forthcoming talks, was the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_255">With the exception of the better regulation unit, which currently has a contract with Goodbody economic consultants to provide economic support and advice to Departments in the preparation of regulatory impact analyses, my Department does not use economic advisers.  A small team of consultants is assisting in a comprehensive study on the all-island economy which is being undertaken at the request of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Secretary of State.  That study is likely to be completed in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_256">The question of further sessions of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will be kept under review.  As of now, there are no plans for a further meeting.</p>

            <p eId="para_257">The Taoiseach will meet the British Prime Minister before the 24 November deadline.  Is it his view that the parties in Northern Ireland will get together to enable a restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly?  How fair is the recent announcement about making administrative structures available for those who were previously involved in loyalism?  Will they be able to resolve their problems through democratic principles?  Is the Taoiseach hopeful that this will happen?  In view of the fact that Mr. Blair may not be Prime Minister in 12 months' time, there may be forces at work among some elements of Northern Irish politics who might not want this to proceed.  What is the Taoiseach's view on this?</p>
            <p eId="para_258">When he meets the Prime Minister, will he pursue the issue of a public inquiry into the Pat Finucane case?  This House unanimously called for such an inquiry some time ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_259">In respect of the Taoiseach's contacts with the United states, what is the present status of Shannon Airport's business regarding troop transits?  I understand a decision was made to transfer such business to Germany.  Has the Taoiseach discussed this with American interests?</p>
            <p eId="para_260">Recently, I saw a report stating that the Government intends to set up a forum for conflict resolution.  In this House a couple of years ago, Deputy Gay Mitchell made a proposal for a European centre for transatlantic conflict resolution, which would be based at Shannon and would be funded in part by the European Union and by the American Administration with a number of conditions applied.  Is this what the Taoiseach has in mind?  Does he consider that to be a realistic proposal, given Ireland's capacity to negotiate and make headway in many conflicts around the world?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_261">On the general position, the recall of the Assembly on 15 May has proved to be an important milestone.  While the process was slow at the outset, progress has been made subsequently and continues to be made.  The engagement which has taken place among all the parties in the forum has been extremely helpful.  It is jointly chaired by Sinn Féin and the DUP and a considerable amount of effort has gone into dealing with and teasing out important substantive issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_262">However, I regret the continuing absence of direct engagement between the DUP and the leading Nationalist party, namely, Sinn Féin.  Clearly, this is unhelpful to the process of getting agreement.  Throughout the year, I have urged the DUP to engage directly with Sinn Féin.  That would be helpful.  I still wish it would happen because it would help to make progress before what is a definitive deadline of 24 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_263">We have seen the DUP in the same room as Sinn Féin and other parties at the Preparation for Government Committee which is jointly chaired.  It has been examining a range of issues, including policing, how the institutions will operate, the important economic issues that will face an incoming executive and there has been agreement on a number of issues to date.  Others, obviously the most difficult ones, have yet to be resolved and will be the subject of further discussion when we meet in Scotland next month.</p>
            <p eId="para_264">The deadline is entirely realistic.  More than a year has elapsed since IRA decommissioning and the IRA statement announcing the end of its activities.  It is now a matter of leadership and political will.  We overcame most of the difficult issues in recent years and there is no reason the remaining few issues cannot now be resolved.  Hence, 24 November is a real and fixed deadline.  Our aim is to secure agreement for the restoration of the devolved institutions of the Good Friday Agreement by that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_265">While good progress has been made, the continued failure of the two parties that are to be in the Executive together to engage worries me greatly, as it is time for progress on that issue.  However, this is a matter for the DUP.  As I understand it, Sinn Féin are ready to have such a meeting at any time.</p>
            <p eId="para_266">On the payment to loyalist groups and the recent announcements, I met the Ulster Political Research Group, UPRG, on 13 July.  The meeting was extremely positive and focused and that group is trying hard.  During the meeting, its representatives briefed me on the conflict transformation initiative they have prepared.  The initiative aims to bring about a genuine transformation in loyalism and is an extremely welcome development.  Like all such matters, this will not happen overnight.  It will take time.  However, they have assembled a good plan to move away from paramilitarism and into community activity and working within their neighbourhoods.  This is similar to the activities of many community partnerships, development companies and groups in the Republic.  We have helped them in recent years and organisations have helped them by showing how such groups operate.</p>
            <p eId="para_267">I informed the UPRG that the two Governments were committed to the restoration of the Assembly.  I also said that if the Northern Ireland political parties fail to reach agreement, the two Governments will initiate a partnership arrangement to implement and protect the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_268">I welcome the British Government's intention to fund a conflict transformation initiative in loyalist areas.  It is important to so do and while I have always called on it to fund initiatives in Nationalist areas, it is equally important to call on it to help in this respect.  Many within loyalism wish to break from the past and are genuinely engaged in efforts to move the organisation away from paramilitary activity and criminality.  Such work should be supported and while the Government will not fund it, it has stated that any arm of the State or of community activity in the Republic will be glad to provide help.  They have built up a number of ties, which is important.</p>
            <p eId="para_269">I have stated a number of times that the British Government should extend practical assistance to those leaders within loyalism who work for transformation within their communities.  We are extending practical assistance in several ways.  We also give small grants from the Department of Foreign Affairs' reconciliation fund to groups in deprived loyalist communities and engage with a number of them.  I hope such initiatives can assist in delivering transformation in loyalist areas and I hope we will see further progress in this respect.  While I cannot say everything is perfect, we have had an extraordinary summer.  It has probably been the best summer since the early 1960s.  Even before the Troubles officially started in 1968, the North had been tense for several years.  As for other work, a comprehensive all-island economic study is being undertaken which is intended to try to induce both business and trade union interests to work on the all-island economy and to try to help in its transformation.</p>
            <p eId="para_270">As for the issue regarding the United States, discussions are under way.  While I am not completely up to date with matters pertaining to the Department of Transport, the United States indicated that, as they did some years ago, they would move more and more of their activities to their bases in Germany.  To the best of my knowledge, some larger aircraft already go directly to Germany.  While a substantial number of flights still come here, this trend will increase, for American logistical reasons.  Moreover, the American relationship with the German Administration is probably far stronger than was the case at the start of the conflict, which is probably also relevant.  However, while it is not a question of them ceasing, they are certainly down-sizing their involvement in Shannon.</p>

            <p eId="para_271">Is the Taoiseach aware that the continued participation of Sinn Féin in the Hain approach at the Assembly is geared solely towards the full restoration of the Good Friday Agreement?  Is the Taoiseach aware there are real concerns, both within Sinn Féin and across Nationalist and republican opinion within the North of Ireland and throughout this island, that many Unionist representatives clearly are using the current arrangement in the Assembly to divert attention away from the main task at hand?  Is he aware there is also real concern within broad republican opinion that the major initiative taken by the IRA last year is not being matched by even a broadening of minds within significant sections of Unionist representation?  Can the Taoiseach assure Members that the 24 November deadline is absolute and that if the DUP does not agree to enter into power sharing before that date, the Irish and British Governments will move on immediately?  Will the Taoiseach assure us that the first priority, which I stress and believe the Taoiseach and I share, is the full restoration of the Executive and the all-Ireland Ministerial Council, and that the two Governments will move forward with the implementation of the Agreement to the maximum extent possible in that situation?  It is not a position at which we want, nor do we believe the Taoiseach wants, to arrive.  There is a responsibility on all involved to try to ensure the DUP, those who are primarily opposed to real momentum and progress at this time, faces up to its collective responsibilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_272">Will the steps the Taoiseach considers taking also include co-operation and integration on an all-Ireland basis of a whole raft of new areas of social and economic co-operation?  That must also be a part of what the Taoiseach envisages post 24 November if the worse case scenario presents itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_273">Is the Taoiseach aware that at a meeting of a Sub-Committee on the Barron Report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights a former senior Garda officer, who had responsibility for the Border region, advised the Members of this House in attendance and others who were before that committee that the Garda had knowledge of the farm at Glenanne prior to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 17 May 1974, which had been infiltrated by British intelligence and that it was from that farm that the bombings of Dublin and Monaghan were planned and executed?  Will the Taoiseach agree this is major information?  Will he accept that the evidence of the former senior Garda officer today before a committee of the Oireachtas——</p>

            <p eId="para_277">The Ceann Comhairle is welcome back from Monaghan.  In light of the evidence given today, will the Taoiseach recognise that the call I made to him previously to seek a special summit with the British Prime Minister on the whole area of collusion has been given greater impetus?  Over the summer period did the Taoiseach ask the British Prime Minister to accede to such a request for a special summit on collusion?  Did he also ask the British Prime Minister to move to ensure the putting in place of a full independent inquiry into the murder of  Mr. Pat Finucane?  I request that he tell us what he said to the British Prime Minister during recent months and inform us as to what he and the British Prime Minister intend to do about these important matters.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_107">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_278">As I said, there is no need for a special summit because at every meeting we stress these important matters, in particular the Finucane case, collusion and issues from the past involving a number of cases with which we have been dealing from the historical position.  We raise these continually with the British Government.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, also raised them with the Secretary of State, Mr. Peter Hain, and I raised them again at our recent meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_279">On the Pat Finucane inquiry in particular, it is always a source of difference between us.  We continue to fully support the holding of an independent public inquiry into this case.  We have made clear that we want the standard agreed at Weston Park and set by Judge Cory adhered to.  We continue to share the concern of the Finucane family and Judge Cory, a point I have continually made, that the new Inquiries Act, under which the British Government intends to have the Finucane case investigated, will not meet these standards.  We continue to raise these issues with the British Government and we continue to support the Finucane family 100%.</p>
            <p eId="para_280">We have been involved and engaged on behalf of families and support groups in a number of other cases in raising the issues concerned.  I assure Deputy Ó Caoláin that I do that at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_281">On the issue of the date, I have already answered that question.  The date in November is real and fixed.  Our aim is to secure the restoration of the devolved institutions and the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Deputy Ó Caoláin and other Members know I do not want to move away from the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  However, if forced to do so, we will have to operate a new partnership arrangement with the British Government, but I would prefer not to do that, and I have made that clear.  If forced to do so, we will have no alternative but to secure the Agreement as best we can.  I have told the loyalist groups, the political groups, all the parties, the British Government and the Americans that the Irish Government's position is full implementation of the Agreement, as the people voted for and as was negotiated.  The alternative is definitely a plan B, as far as we are concerned.  If we have to move to plan B we will do so, and will be ready to do that post-haste if that is what we face.</p>
            <p eId="para_282">As I said, it would be far better if the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin were to have meetings.  Good progress has been made, the joint chair arrangement has worked and substantive agreements have also worked, but there are outstanding issues.  It is a year since decommissioning and even longer since the IRA statement on ending all its activities.  I take this first opportunity of Question Time when answering questions on the North to urge the parties to engage positively over the coming period.  They should not be tempted to play for time.  We are serious about the deadline.  It is fixed.  I hope no party will make the mistake of underestimating the seriousness of the Governments' intent.  We have given the parties more than enough time.  We gave this deadline at the beginning of April, it was not a case of stating it in the middle of the summer or in the autumn.  We must move the process forward.  We need to know whether people want to govern together or not.  There is an enormous responsibility on all the partners, but particularly on the largest parties, to move forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_283">Deputy Ó Caoláin knows my view on a point where I believe he can also help.  It is  that Sinn Féin will have to commit completely to policing in the context of an agreement.  Any right thinking person should understand the significance of this.  Northern Ireland would be an entirely different place in a context where agreement on government and policing were finally achieved.  This obviously is an issue that must be resolved.  I accept it must be resolved as part of an overall agreement, but it is a very important issue.  The best way of making progress on this in the short term is for the DUP and Sinn Féin in particular to engage — all the parties are engaging — and sit down and deal with this issue.</p>

As the Deputy is aware from the inquiry and the reports of it by Mr. Justice Barron, it is clear throughout them that there is an identified location where activities were going on and that was highlighted a number of times.  Mr. Justice Barron definitely wrote a considerable amount about that in his first report.  It is a serious matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_286">As the Deputy is aware, I have raised previously that after the Dublin and Monaghan bombings not a great deal of activity seems to have happened around that issue for whatever reason.  It is through the work we had done here, the groups I got together and through the work of the late Mr. Justice Hamilton and Mr. Justice Barron that much of this information was uncovered.  The Garda investigations into these matters closed in August 1974, which I have always said was extraordinary.  It would be more extraordinary if the Deputy told me today that a senior Garda who was on duty at that time would have known that and that the inquiry was still closed in August 1974.</p>

            <p eId="para_290">I take it from what the Taoiseach has said that there is no backing away from the 24 November on the part of the two Governments.  Has he thought about what would be the correct course of action if there were no progress from the talks in Scotland?  Is there any point in persisting until 24 November if there is none?  Would it not be better to call it a day at that stage?</p>
            <p eId="para_291">Do I misinterpret the comments of the preparation for Government committee of the DUP as suggesting it is not ready to share power?  If I do not, is the best way to test the DUP's mettle for Sinn Féin to declare its support for policing in Northern Ireland?  Has there been any progress in the summer months in respect of the likelihood of Sinn Féin taking its seats on the policing board?</p>
            <p eId="para_292">If things do not proceed as we hope they will, what is the Taoiseach's expectation of what will happen to the North-South bodies in any new dispensation?  Will it be possible for them to continue in existence and will it be possible to expand their role?</p>
            <p eId="para_293">How does the Taoiseach respond to statements, made during private discussions a number of us have held with senior members of the DUP, to the effect that they have come to grips with many issues in recent times and are prepared to see a form of democracy return to Northern Ireland in the form of devolved institutions but are damned if they are going to co-operate with an arbitrary date set by the two Governments?  They say that is not the way to make progress and that they will do so in their own time rather than respond to the fixing of an arbitrary date by the British and Irish Governments.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_294">The Deputy asked a number of questions and I will answer the last one first.  I know the arguments the DUP makes but they cannot say it is an arbitrary date because it is one the British Government fixed at Cabinet level and enshrined in legislation which was passed by the House of Lords and the House of Commons.  They cannot blame the Irish Government if it is a date embedded in their own legislation via a legislative assembly in which they have considerable participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_295">We argued from January until spring this year that a reasonable amount of time should be allowed for serious dialogue with the parties in the absence of the issues which previously existed, such as the IRA being active or the International Monitoring Commission's inability to produce accurate reports on the progress of decommissioning.  We suggested we leave it for the entire year so the end of the November was fixed as a suitable date and transposed into legislation.  On that basis I put considerable effort into persuading parties to agree to the recommencement on 15 May of the Assembly so that dialogue could take place and committees meet.  If I had not been able to say that, more than one party would have refused to enter into the Assembly to get things moving again and to stay with it for a prolonged period.  That was the right call.  The date is set in legislation and people cannot keep pushing it back.  The British Government is as firm as the Irish on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_296">The North-South bodies and other mechanisms that exist have been operating on a temporary basis and in their own way have proved satisfactory and led to some progress.  However, it is nothing compared with what we should have achieved.  The North-South bodies should have been much enhanced and more progress made.  They have existed on a caretaker basis which has held back a number of decisions, including some legislative measures we were to deal with in this House.  That is an unsatisfactory position.</p>
            <p eId="para_297">Deputy Rabbitte asked what would happen if we had to move on to a plan B.  We have held detailed discussions with the British Government on how to deal with new arrangements on the basis of partnership.  It is not my preferred way but we have made constitutional changes and made concessions in many areas.  The North-South element is very important and new partnership arrangements must embrace those issues in a very substantive way.  As the Deputy pointed out to me previously, including in written form some years ago, there are legislative implications which we cannot just set aside.  The Attorney General has consistently made clear that they are important issues and I made that point very clearly to the British Government at the meeting in November.</p>
            <p eId="para_298">I hope it does not come to that but all the parties in Northern Ireland must decide in the next few months if they really want to share power based on the strength of their parties, which is the basis of the Good Friday Agreement.  That is the only way of governing Northern Ireland because of the unique situation there.  It is not like this State or other places and the Agreement is the basis for it so people cannot stand back from it.</p>
            <p eId="para_299">On policing, it is important that Sinn Féin commits completely to policing in the context of an agreement, which is necessary in Northern Ireland.  There has been ongoing dialogue on that issue but I cannot be sure what Sinn Féin will do.  I hope we can make progress in that area.  It is essential because we will not persuade the DUP or others to agree unless that is resolved.</p>

Yesterday the sub-committee on the Barron report met victims, including Stephen Travers of the Miami showband massacre, the Dundalk families and others who gave evidence and made oral submissions.  We heard of their grief and hurt and their serious allegations of collusion at the time.  Will the Taoiseach strongly raise these issues with the British Government?  Many of these victims are very concerned that the same mistakes will be made again whereby everybody retreats into a cushy silence and there is no movement from certain quarters in the North in respect of these talks.  This is a very important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_301">I wish to raise very strongly the recent incident of the intimidation of an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs in the North, who I believe was doing much valuable work assisting people in Unionist communities.  I ask the Taoiseach to point out that this is not acceptable to anybody on this island, especially when it happens to one of our own civil servants.  What is the exact situation in regard to that?</p>
            <p eId="para_302">I attended the sub-committee on the Barron report this morning and, as Deputy Ó Caoláin mentioned earlier, new information is coming forward about information the Garda had at the time of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  I urge the Taoiseach to raise these issues with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and with the British Government.  If the November deadline is blocked by the DUP and not reached, will the Taoiseach consider the sensible proposal, which many Members of this House, notwithstanding some cynics, support, of allowing Northern Irish elected representatives to sit and participate in debates in this House?</p>

            <p eId="para_303">How was plan B, reported in the newspapers, formulated and is the Taoiseach satisfied there has been sufficient consultation will all parties involved to ensure it will not set back progress and make it more difficult to make an agreement?  Will plan B be on the agenda of next month's multi-party talks in St. Andrew's?  Following my attendance and that of other Members of this House at the British-Irish Association conference in Oxford the Taoiseach will be aware of considerable and growing reports of the sectarian gulf in many communities, which is growing apace irrespective of the levels of violence.  It seems to be ingrained and to be getting worse in the absence of political progress.  Does the Taoiseach see a role for the non-sectarian parties, which find it difficult in the climate of a polarised society?  Will he ensure that any consultation takes into account their importance in developing a normal society and that, regardless of their size, they are engaged to ensure that sectarian gulf in bridged at every opportunity?</p>

            <p eId="para_304">I will continue to raise the issues mentioned by Deputy McGrath.  I consistently engage with at least ten such groups on issues including the shooting of Mr. Pat Finucane and the Miami Showband massacre.  I make the case to the British Government and to the Northern Ireland Office and my officials will continue to do so.  I will return to the Deputy's point on the Civil Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_305">Deputy Sargent's point about the sectarian gulf continues to be of major concern because in some of these communities overcoming these issues is difficult.  We are trying, through every channel, including the Ulster Political Research Group, the reconciliation fund for North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Ireland Fund from the United States and the economic initiative to change that position as much as possible through the education system and co-operation among religious institutions to break down those barriers of mistrust and to work with the initiative to remove graffiti and flags.  The parties are working directly to build cross-party contacts and dialogue.  Sinn Féin has been doing this for some time.  This is important.</p>
            <p eId="para_306">Deputy McGrath raised an important point about a member of our Civil Service.  The PSNI informed us that it had reason to believe there was a threat against an Irish official working closely with loyalist communities.  Measures were taken to ensure the officer's safety.  It was a matter of concern and we went to some efforts to deal with it.  Beyond that I do not propose to comment on the details of individual cases.  We all join in deploring this threat.  Some of the strongest condemnations came from within the loyalist communities.  Several loyalist leaders underlined the importance of the work the individual had been doing to assist their communities.  While the incident will not diminish our determination to do all we can to assist the process of transformation in loyalism, we had to take protective measures for the individual official.</p>

I suggest that the Government accept this and clarify these matters once and for all.</p>

Is it intended, in light of the public interest in this issue, that the Government will give time either tomorrow or next week to deal with some of the outstanding matters arising from the Taoiseach's full statement last night in terms of ethics, State board appointments, public service obligations, taxation issues and definitions of the term "gift" under the tax law?</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_274">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_760">I wish to share time with Deputy Trevor Sargent.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill 2006.  It is an important issue and an important debate because we need well thought out legislation in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">When we address important issues such as oil and gas, particularly our natural resources, we must have a comprehensive debate and listen to all views in the House.  In recent days there have been massive increases in gas prices, particularly for families, the elderly and working people.  Many people are upset about the 23% increase in gas prices, which will be a major issue in the coming weeks.  I support these people on these issues.  It was announced that workers would receive a 10% increase in pay over 27 months through national pay agreements and within 24 hours gas and other energy costs went through the roof.  That is a disgrace and it is not acceptable in this day and age.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">We need to have well thought out strategies regarding this legislation.  We should not be afraid to look to other countries for advice on this legislation and the entire issue of energy, oil and gas.  When considering the broader issue of oil and gas we should accept that these resources around our shores belong to the people of Ireland, not oil companies.  There should be sensible policies regarding licences in these cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">The main provision of the Bill is to establish a National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, as a stand alone, non-commercial State body under the aegis of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with responsibility for the maintenance of strategic supplies of oil, in line with the State's oil stock holding obligations to the EU and the International Energy Agency.  The Bill provides for the transfer of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation shareholding in NORA to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The Bill also provides for the continued operation of the agency as a private limited company under the Companies Act.  It will provide for a variable levy on disposals of petroleum products to be imposed on oil companies and consumers.  Such a levy has operated since 1995 under EU regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The Bill also makes provision for the furnishing of regular returns to the Minister regarding oil purchases, sales, consumption, imports and exports by oil companies, oil consumers and NORA.  The Bill provides for the monitoring of compliance by oil companies and consumers with its provisions.  The legislation also revokes the European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oils) Regulations 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">These are the main provisions in the legislation and they are very important in dealing with this issue.  It is important in considering this Bill that we wake up to the future and examine alternative energy sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">I strongly welcome some of the radical proposals that have been put forward concerning wind and sea as sources of power, as well as other sensible alternatives.  On an island such as Ireland, great potential exists to invest in renewable energy, particularly wind farms, and people must accept that this is a clean, positive and constructive form of energy.  I do not accept the criticisms from those who complain about the locations of wind farms because wind energy is a very sensible option that should be developed further.  I acknowledge that we have made a start and that objectives have been put in place, but we must do far more in the future.  Wind can be a major source of energy and we have a climate that is ideally suited to its use.  This is the sensible way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">We must also be radical with regard to oil and gas.  We need a national vision to deal with these resources.  I do not accept the power that many oil companies seem to have, whether it be in Ireland, Nigeria or Latin America.  I urge people, when they are examining natural resources such as oil and gas, to consider the sensible ideas coming from countries in South America.  They are dealing very constructively with their oil resources and distributing it to the poorer sections of their communities.  I am referring, in particular, to Venezuela, which has shown a clear vision and is using its wealth for its people.  The government there is building houses in the ghettoes, providing people with health care and has even offered low-cost oil to poor people in the United States of America.  That is the kind of international co-operation that we should be examining in this debate.  It is also the kind of sensible vision which bodes well for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">The Corrib gas field in County Mayo is an important issue in this debate.  Deputies are aware that there is a major dispute going on in that area.  I make no apology for supporting the people who want our gas resources in the control of the Irish people and who also want proper safety measures put in place.  I commend people like the Rossport five for their efforts.  Perhaps it is not trendy, politically correct nor fashionable to say that at present, but they have sent out a very strong message.  They are not just concerned about safety issues but also about the way our natural resources are distributed.  Offers of an additional payment of €10,000 have been made to land owners on the route of the pipeline in recent days.  My colleague, Deputy Cowley, has been very strong in his position and I commend and support him on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Many people in the national media, some of those in Government and the oil companies are running negative campaigns against the protesting families in Mayo.  The reality, according to a recent opinion poll, is that 61% of people in the local community support them 100%, despite the massive pressure being exerted.  The message from the protestors is that they want complete safety for the local people and a clear, well-thought out policy on our natural resources and how they are used.  In the context of the recent large increases in the price of oil and gas, we must wake up to the reality that, with Corrib, we are sitting on a goldmine.  That goldmine should be used for the benefit of the consumers and citizens of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Section 8 of the legislation sets out the principal functions and powers of the national oil reserves agency.  In the explanatory memorandum, the agency's primary functions are defined as "the maintenance of strategic oil reserves to meet Ireland's obligations to the EU and the IEA, the collection of a levy on petroleum products, the provision of advice to the Minister on any matter relating to its functions and representation of the state at meetings of international bodies".  The memorandum further explains that section 10 "is a standard feature which provides that the authorized share capital of NORA will be decided by the Minister for Finance after consulting with the Minister".</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Section 14 is relevant to the debate we had in the House earlier.  It provides for a board of six directors who, with the exception of the chief executive, will be appointed by the Minister.  According to the explanatory memorandum "Directors appointed by the Minister are required under <i>subsection (2)</i> to have experience and competence in one of the following areas: oil or oil related industries, chemical or chemical related industries, finance, economics, legal matters and energy production and supply industries.”   In the context of the recent row, I would question the competence of some of the people who were appointed by the Taoiseach to State boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is important that we accept and acknowledge that the natural energy resources of oil and gas of this country belong to the people.  There should be no surrender on this issue.  Oil and gas are national resources which should be managed and owned by the people on the island of Ireland, North and South.  I commend the cross-Border initiatives aimed at linking both parts of the island in a one-island economy.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_275">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_774">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta McGrath as a chuid ama a roinnt.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">The National Oil Reserves Agency Bill is technical in nature and falls far short of what is needed if this country is to face up to the major challenges in the area of energy.  Thanks to the Government, Ireland, <i>per capita</i>, is the seventh most oil dependent country in the world.  In the period 1989 to 2001, we doubled our oil use.  Oil accounts for 60% of our energy imports, while the EU average is 43%.  We are very exposed in terms of energy in this country.  We are now importing 9 million tonnes of oil and that figure is increasing by an average of 3% per year.  By 2008, we will be importing approximately 12 million tonnes of oil.  This is an unsustainable situation and no amount of oil reserves will deal with it.  However, the Government has yet to face up to this fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">We are continuing to build to a very low standard when it comes to energy insulation.  Oil-fired central heating is essentially heating the atmosphere in many houses because they are so badly insulated.  We rank 23rd out of 24 countries in the OECD in terms of poor energy efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">It is in this context that I wish to offer a few useful suggestions to the Government regarding oil.  The debate regarding oil does not relate to simply burning it.  Oil is a product that can be turned into many useful things.  Over 4,000 products are listed as being derivatives of oil, including aspirin, DVDs, perfume, contact lenses and so forth.  To use oil only in the context of burning is to waste a valuable resource.  The University of Limerick has carried out extensive research into biomass and developing many of the by-products of oil from cellulose.  The Government must pay close attention to the researchers who are proposing that much of our energy needs as well as the raw material needs for the pharmaceutical industry could be met by more indigenous production than is currently the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Ireland is in very serious jeopardy in terms of amber alerts and blackouts.  In 2005 there were 57 amber alerts in this country.  There has been much focus on the Corrib gasfield in recent times.  The way people have been treated in that area is a terrible indictment of the Government and the manner in which it has favoured the corporate interests of a few over the welfare of the wider community.  However, the Corrib gasfield will not solve our energy problems.  During the next 15 to 20 years between 50% and 70% of our gas may come from the Corrib field but we will still be obliged to pay for it at the same price as gas from Siberia and other places.  The gas will be sold privately and we will be obliged to buy it on the open market and will not be able to argue about the price.  It is not a solution and the gas in the field will be badly needed in future when it becomes even more critical that we have some locally available energy source in order to build our renewable energy technologies and get on the road to being far more self-reliant.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Oil, however, is a slippery subject.  It is the focus of much public relations activity and spin to the effect that there is no problem, that the price is going down and that people should not become too concerned about it because everything will be fine.  We know this is not true and the Government needs to be very careful in distinguishing between the spin in the interest of the market and geopolitical, geological and environmental realities based on science.  This is exactly what needs to be made known in a very coherent and straightforward way.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The geopolitical realities are always present.  The Iraq war was a clear demonstration of how spin can overtake reality.  Secretary Rumsfeld says the Iraq war has nothing to do with oil, yet, before the invasion of Iraq and 18 months before the events of 11 September 2001, the oilfields in Iraq were studied by the White House energy task force.  Halliburton obtained a contract to carry out repairs and the first thing that was protected during the invasion was the Iraqi oil ministry.  There is very clear evidence that it is a resource war.  My perception is that the Government has decided that it is far too difficult to change the habits of its short lifetime and that it will, therefore, tag itself onto the coat-tails of the victor in whatever resource war takes place.  This is not only illogical, it is also unethical.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">This State is not using its natural resources and I ask that the Government reconsider the potential in Ireland for moving away from oil as a critical part of our lives and economy.  It is not only the case that oil will not be available in the future but also that if we continue to burn the stuff, we will be accelerating a very serious inequality in that 20% of the world's population are burning 60% of the energy resources.  If we continue to burn it, China and India will want to do so.  Countries much larger than Ireland will tip the balance in respect of climate change.  If the Minister has not seen "An Inconvenient Truth", the film Al Gore, the former Vice President of the United States, was involved in making, it is very important that he do so.  I ask that watching it be on his and his colleagues' agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Ireland is the fifth largest emitter of greenhouses gases <i>per capita</i>.  The earth is warmer now than it has been during the past 11,000 years.  We are fast approaching what is called the feedback effect, in which methane will be released from the permafrost in the Arctic, Antarctic, tundra areas of Siberia, Norway and other such places when it melts.  The release of methane will be similar to that at the onslaught of the last Ice Age.  This could possibly happen within a decade.  What will the Minister of State say to his children and the citizens of the country if this is not taken seriously?  Other countries are showing us what to do — it is not a matter of reinventing the wheel.  Sweden has clearly stated that it will move beyond oil, oil reserves and what we are talking about in this Bill by 2020.  The authorities in Iceland are talking about a hydrogen economy.  This will not be easy but they see the need for it because they do not see any other option.  This Government, rather than trying to build more capacity to store somebody else’s oil, should recognise that the days of oil are fast coming to an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">We need to put in place a strategy.  The Government promised that it would publish an energy policy in July.  However, July and August came and went.  September is nearly gone and it is talking about publishing the policy, perhaps on Sunday.  Does this sound like an urgent approach to a critical issue, bearing in mind that people face the danger of blackouts this winter?  I ask that the Minister take this matter more seriously than any other facing this country.  Every hospital, school, commuter and householder who needs to heat his or her home depends on the Minister doing so.  There is no issue more critical to this country than that of taking the energy crisis seriously.  It will not be taken seriously just by building more capacity for oil.</p>

          <from>Mr. Haughey</from>
          <p eId="para_786">The central concern of this Bill is to ensure the future security of Ireland's oil supply.  Contained in it are actions and precautions that are necessary to take at this time due to Ireland's over-reliance on imported fossil fuels.  I hope such precautions will be negated in the future by the maturing of our current energy policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Ireland now consumes at least 50% more oil <i>per capita</i> than the EU average, which is simply not sustainable.  This Government is working very hard to address this over-reliance and Departments are working closely together in developing a cohesive and joined-up strategy to take a new direction involving the full exploitation of our natural resources.  Not only is this necessary, given that oil is a finite resource to which we have no direct access, but the benefits of a lasting and workable renewable energy policy are extensive, economically and environmentally.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">Geographically, Ireland holds a unique position in Europe.  It means that we are blessed with one of the largest wind resources in Europe and one of the highest wave energy levels in the world.  Our coastline has the potential to provide approximately twice as much electricity as we currently use.  Despite this impressive potential, approximately 95% of the energy consumed by this country is fossil-fuel based and we are debating legislation concerning the security of supply of this fuel, which is costly in terms of our pockets and the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">Current global circumstances have once again highlighted worldwide energy consumption and the precariousness of the oil market.  Our neighbours in Britain have been considering their future energy supply and during the summer their Government revealed that this would include the construction of further nuclear stations.  Around the same time, in July, I secured legislative assurance, in the form of an amendment to the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill, that power from nuclear sources can never be considered as an option in Ireland.  This amendment ensured a nuclear-free Ireland and our colleagues in the North support this aim.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">Sadly, however, Ireland's proximity to Britain and the British Government's stated preference for nuclear energy mean we are not free of the nuclear threat.  The implications for Ireland of a UK nuclear programme could be pretty horrific.  It has been estimated that should an accident occur at the Wylfa nuclear power plant on Anglesey, more than 2 million Irish people could face compulsory resettlement.  This is an unimaginable scenario, but its possibility must be recognised and faced.  Radiation does not respect international borders.  We need to maintain our pressure on the relevant bodies and continue to pursue every avenue open to us to ensure our safety against overseas nuclear threats.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">In the meantime, we can continue our progress towards renewable energy sources and set an example.  We have obligations under the Kyoto Protocol and this is relevant to today's proceedings, as previous speakers have outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The transport sector is the largest consumer of energy in the country.  In addition, it is growing at the fastest rate.  We absolutely must halt and reverse this trend if we are to have any success under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">There is a solution in biofuels, which have neither the economic nor environmental drawbacks of oil, and I am pleased to be able to say action is well under way in terms of their adoption.  In budget 2006, the Minister for Finance made €200 million available for the development of the biofuel market.  This was an extremely productive contribution to what we are trying to achieve in this respect.  A market needs to be nurtured to encourage the use of biofuels and this is a healthy start.  I look forward to further measures being incorporated in the forthcoming budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">In May 2006, Dublin Bus became the first public transport company to incorporate the use of biofuels into its operations.  That came about in the wake of a review by Dublin Bus of the viability of their use in view of rising fuel costs.  Last year, fuel cost 40% more than in 2004.  Trying to absorb such rises when a suitable cheaper alternative is available is bad business.  A pilot scheme is ongoing involving the use of biofuels for a fleet of tour buses.  Those run on such fuel proudly carry a badge to confirm it.  I look forward to the report on the pilot scheme being published and very much hope it results in extension of the use of biofuels to the full Dublin Bus fleet.  A successful pilot scheme and subsequent extension of the project by a high profile company such as Dublin Bus would boost the credibility of biofuels as a workable and reliable resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">That is just one initiative being undertaken regarding use of renewable energy resources.  The Government has sponsored plenty more, including the greener homes scheme, which is worth €27 million in grants to individual householders who install renewable technologies, including wood-pellet stoves and boilers, solar panels and geothermal heat pumps.  This week, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is present, will unveil the Power of One campaign, highlighting what individuals across the country can do to reduce wasteful energy consumption.  People are becoming ever more aware of the effects of a change in their own energy habits, and collectively their efforts will make a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Those are the challenges that face us regarding energy consumption, but it is clear to everyone that the solutions are readily available to us, and I am confident the Government is developing and pursuing the best possible policies for the country.  I am happy to support the Bill in view of the current situation, but I firmly believe the renewable energy crusade must be sustained and effectively implemented to ensure this Bill is a short-term contingency.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">I am conscious that Deputy Fiona O'Malley will speak after me in this debate, and I congratulate the committee on which she sits on the Oireachtas energy report published earlier this year.  It provoked a very useful debate.  The Deputy has different views on nuclear power from me, and that was a topic of discussion at the press launch and in subsequent media debate.  However, debate is what we need.  Action must be taken, and I am confident the Government is pursuing appropriate policies.  I wish it well in its endeavours.</p>

          <from>Ms F. O’Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_804">Given our growth and how dramatically the country has progressed since the 1990s, dealing with our CO2 obligations is an enormous challenge.  I see the Bill before us and know that the Green Paper on energy is to be launched on Sunday.  The work the Minister did yesterday shows that the hot topic of this week is certainly energy awareness.  I took his advice after reading his ten-point plan this morning, cycling to work and using public transport when I had to return to the constituency for something else this afternoon.  It brings home the need for us all to become self-sufficient and the part that each individual can play in energy efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">That is why I feel the question of the nation's fuel security is something vitally important that is addressed in this Bill.  I am sure it will be a major element of the forthcoming Green Paper, which I look forward to reading.  The Bill before us deals with the country's strategic oil reserves and how our EU and other obligations are to be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">There is something for which we must plan carefully.  As we all know, we have fallen short regarding our commitments, so we need a strategic plan to arrive at them.  We must think about where capacity is needed, and that reminds me of the Progressive Democrats plan to move Dublin Port to Bremore.  It underlines that requirement, not least because we have already reached capacity at Dublin Port.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Given the limit and the Seveso Directive, dealing with a certain type of hazard in an urban context puts constraints on development.  That is the reality of Dublin Port and a reason for us to plan ahead effectively for the country and consider where we might build storage capacity.  The only real option is to move Dublin Port out of the city centre and to a green-field site.  Some might ask about the rest of the country, but the capacity and energy are needed on the east coast, which is why they must be delivered here.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">We must also remember in sorting out storage and getting our reserves in order that we have limited refining capacity.  We must be sure the stores are for petroleum products rather than crude oil.  What the market requires must be matched by what we store.  We all remember the fuel shortages of the 1970s, and we must plan ahead so they are not a feature of Ireland in 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">We must also be very cognisant of the Corrib gas field.  Where we have indigenous energy supplies, we must exploit them.  I do not like to provoke situations, but I was most discouraged to see that hostilities and tempers were running quite high again on bringing gas supplies to shore and marketing them.  We must be realistic; we operate in a real world where prices are rising.  Each of us campaigning on the doorstep will hear, as I have recently, that people are concerned about energy for the first time, given the increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">It is not a panacea to deliver our own indigenous sources through the Corrib gas field, for example, but it certainly decreases our dependency on imported fossil fuels, and it is imperative that we extract that gas.  I know the Minister has gone to great lengths and shown tremendous patience in dealing with it.  The history of the matter is well documented, but we really must get the gas delivered, not only for the country at large but for the people of the western seaboard.  We must be realistic and recognise that Shell does not have endless resources, and at some point it may walk away.  We must be cognisant of that and try to deliver the opportunity to exploit our indigenous gas reserves in as a clear a way as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">The entire question of energy centres on efficiency.  That is why I welcome the initiatives presented yesterday by the Minister.  More are to be introduced in the area of transport tomorrow.  That is where we stand to gain a great deal.  In terms of generation, it costs much less to save a kilojoule of energy than it does to generate it.  That must be to the fore in our policies.  In geographic terms, Ireland is well located in respect of the development of renewable energies, particularly wind, wave and tidal power.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Given the initiatives in last year's budget as regards the fourth level of education, I should love to see Ireland become the research and development capital of the world for renewable energies.  That certainly is my ambition for the country.  I hope it is an ambition the Minister shares.  However, we need to deliver it and ensure that we create the circumstances whereby that is done.  One thing I have learned in politics is that one can deliver if one believes strongly enough in something.  That is why we need to have those ambitious plans for the country.  Ireland, which is situated on the periphery of Europe and at the end of any pipeline, is extremely exposed.  We need to be imaginative and develop our own initiatives.  There have been plenty of them so far and we need to galvanise these energies.  In particular, I welcome the publication of the Green Paper at the end of the week.  I also welcome the introduction of this Bill and look forward to dealing with what I see as the most exciting challenge in politics at present, namely, dealing with our energy security and ensuring safe energy for the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_285">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_813">It is appropriate that this Bill is being debated at a time when the multinationals that control all our oil and gas reserves are attempting to impose an unwanted terminal on the people of north Mayo.  It is also worth recalling that the Government sought to use two inadequate reports on the safety of the Corrib pipeline to justify that project proceeding against the wishes — as was proven again this week in the TG4 poll — of most of the people in the area affected.  It is also relevant as regards any debate on the overall terms of energy supplies, as briefly became the focus of debate following publication of the Forfás report last April on the future availability of oil.  In that context, the possibility of nuclear energy fulfilling demand was suggested, but that has been overwhelmingly rejected by virtually the entire spectrum of political opinion across the country.  That is hardly surprising in light of the enormous ongoing concerns of people regarding Sellafield.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">The Forfás report refers briefly to the possibility of replacing some of our dependence on fossil fuels with alternative sources, most notably wind and wave power.  There is also reference to biofuels.  This is something that needs far more attention and a much more proactive policy on behalf of the State, given the importance of alternative energy and the natural advantages enjoyed by this country as regards its production.  Certainly, wind power appears to be an area that has enormous potential.  One report I have seen suggests that the current proportion of electricity supplied from this source could be increased to 25% of demand, with no increase in cost to the consumer.  The installation of turbines would obviously require a substantial increase in the amount of land involved, but this is estimated to be at most no more than 0.5%.  Given the number of suitable sites available and not currently in agricultural use, that ought not to present a major problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">A number of wind projects are currently in operation, but some concern has been raised with regard to the awarding of contracts.  It appears that one company with significant political influence has been particularly favoured.  It is important, therefore, that the sector is properly regulated and that the State takes a proactive role in research and development.  In practical terms, the ESB should establish wind farms.  It will, of course be ideologically argued that the State should have no role in such an area.  Such an argument overlooks the reason utilities were developed in the first instance under public control.  It was for the simple reason that private enterprise was either uninterested, incapable or solely concerned with niche profits.  There is also the fact that the country's energy needs ought to be under public control for strategic reasons.  The same argument can be applied to the area of biofuels.  There is enormous potential in Ireland for the production of energy crops, especially in the era of the single farm payment.  That does not appear to be a problem and the relevant Departments are coming to recognise that through the various grant schemes available.  This is a welcome development.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">There are also issues surrounding the use of set aside land that the Minister for Agriculture and Food might usefully press at Commission level.  Not only should we be capable of meeting the EU target set for the proportion of vehicle fuel supplied from biofuels, but we could lay the basis for a much more ambitious sector that benefits both farmers and those involved in processing.  Unless steps are taken to encourage a strong Irish processing sector, we will in the future be just as dependent on biofuel imports as we are in the area of fossil fuels.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">My party and others have put the case for the use of the former sugar factories at Carlow and Mallow in the processing of ethanol from sugar beet.  This would not only provide an alternative outlet for sugar beet produced by the 3,700 growers abandoned by Greencore, it would also generate jobs.  Unfortunately, the Government washed its hands of any responsibility in this matter, despite  its retention of a so-called golden share in the company.  It would appear the only golden shares in Greencore are those that are in the portfolio of the property developers who took over what was once a thriving business in order to strip the assets and make a huge killing through the building of overpriced apartments.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">I urge the Minister as part of the review of the energy sector to encourage indigenous renewable energy sources and, of course, to review the current terms and conditions governing the control of our oil and gas reserves.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_286">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_819">I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill, which gathers together and updates the existing strands of legislation as regards our oil reserves.  Growing oil costs and political instability in the Middle East make it increasingly urgent that alternative sources of energy must be explored.  Every time there is a war in the Middle East, oil prices soar.  That has become a regular feature.  Seldom do we see oil prices falling when peace follows.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Oil prices have recently gone through the $80 a barrel barrier before stabilising somewhat.  Apparently there is no peak is in sight.  It is a very unsettling time.  Crude oil costs have rocketed by 60% in the past year alone, creating a knock-on effect of increased domestic gas, electricity and central heating costs.  Two days ago I spoke to a lorry driver who delivers various goods throughout the country.  He said that he could fill his tank last year with €300.  This year it costs him €400 to do so.  He said we should be raising the issue, particularly for the domestic market, of allowing hauliers to use green diesel.  His argument is that they are probably using green diesel already, which has been washed to become white diesel, and that very little revenue would be lost.  That is a matter I intend to revisit, namely, that we should allow domestic hauliers some leeway.  I am sure, however, there might be difficulties at EU level if green diesel were to be used in different countries.  It is something we should look at, though, and it possibly could have beneficial effects in terms of reducing the costs of goods and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">Escalating oil costs have triggered gas and electricity price rises of between 45% and 25% respectively, which totally belies the rate of inflation.  Everyone one meets talks about the rising ESB and gas bills.  These are ordinary domestic issues which are hitting people in their pockets.  They must be controlled in some way or other.  The cost of a tank of home heating oil now approaches €1,000, which amounts to an increase of €400 on last year's price.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The ordinary individual has been hard in the pocket in respect of living expenses.  Fuel price increases will also percolate down to the cost of bus, train and air fares, which cannot be immune from rising energy costs.  These price increases will eventually hit the consumer.  A person who walks into a shop to buy a loaf of bread will pay the increased price in getting that loaf of bread into the shop in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Ireland remains particularly vulnerable to these spiralling oil costs, with imported fossil fuels accounting for almost 90% of our energy needs.  Every second year, the International Energy Agency publishes an outlook that forecasts the development of the world's energy consumption over the next 20 to 30 years.  The last World Energy Outlook in 2004 forecast a strong increase of energy and oil consumption with a growth rate of about 1.6% per annum.  We could revisit these figures on a weekly basis because of increasing demand in China and India and the pressure that will put on our reserves.  It is scary when one thinks of the increasing population and demand in those countries.  They want the same kind of lifestyle as that we enjoy, which involves the use of fossil fuels.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">The IEA has published an additional outlook for 2005, covering the period up to 2030.  The reason for this unexpected extra publication was probably the unprecedented rise of oil prices during the past year, which caused much public concern.  The recent increases in oil prices had not been forecast.  The publication depicts the most probable development of energy markets until 2030, as seen by the IEA.  Two additional scenarios are considered, one of which is a low investment scenario where investment in upstream activities is much lower than expected.  It also covers an alternative scenario if policy measures are introduced to cut energy demand.  These scenarios include renewable energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">Solar, wind and geothermal energy will increase their contribution in the reference scenario until 2030 to provide 2% of primary energy supply.  People in the building industry should be considering alternative sources to heat homes, such as solar energy.  The grant which has been made available for solar panels is very welcome, as is the grant for geothermal heat, although that will cost a lot to operate.  These ideas should be part of housing schemes.  We should not leave things up to individuals and councils should encourage developers building housing estates.  These concepts should be taken on board and made a part of our lives.  Countries further north than Ireland make much greater use of solar energy.  It is criminal not to be making full use of such energy.  Solar panels could be a prerequisite for every new house so that dependency on oil and gas could be reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">Middle East and north African countries still hold very considerable reserves, but further growth will depend on new discoveries.  If these discoveries fail to materialise, world oil production could peak before 2030.  This aspect of the report is a wild guess because nobody knows exactly how much oil lies beneath the surface or what type of demand will exist in ten years' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Now is an opportune time for the Government to invest in renewable energy sources.  There should be support for more research into alternatives such as hydrogen, solar and wind energy and biofuels, to reduce our dependency on fossil fuel imports.  Recent excise tax relief measures for eight biofuel projects throughout the country are to be welcomed.  It is a step in the right direction.  The development of a sustainable, long-term biofuels processing industry in Ireland assumes greater urgency by the day.  This is also consistent with our Kyoto Protocol obligations and our responsibilities under the 2003 EU biofuels directive.  This requires a 2% minimum biofuel component in our fuel complement by the end of this year.  Our current 0.06% biofuels target falls considerably short of this.  Biofuels are renewable transport fuels, which result in significantly less CO2 emissions than their fossil fuel equivalents.  Biofuels are available in three forms, namely: pure plant oil from the rape seed crop; biodiesel, which is consists of rape seed oil, recovered vegetable oil, tallow and diesel blend in a 5% mix; and bioethanol, which is sugar beet or wheat blended with petrol in a 5% mix for standard petrol engines, or up to 85% mix for use in flexible fuel engines.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Biofuel has not got off to a great start because it reduces performance in cars.  It also leads to a decrease in the number of miles achieved per gallon.  However, we should think of it as the beginning of an era of biofuel in cars.  It has not got the right press at the moment, because it takes much energy to develop the biofuel.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_829">I am grateful for this opportunity to conclude the Second Stage discussion of the provisions of the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill.  The Bill is one of a range of measures being pursued by the Government in order to develop the energy agenda.  It provides NORA with the freedom to operate as a stand-alone agency, while at the same time reinforcing appropriate public policy and corporate governance standards.  The Bill is primarily technical in nature, but it represents a significant milestone in providing Ireland with the best structure in ensuring robust security of national strategic oil stocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, for taking the debate at the beginning of Second Stage.  A number of the issues raised by Deputies in their contributions during this stage of the Bill are addressed in the explanatory memorandum and will be examined in detail on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">Deputy Durkan spoke of the need for planning on energy matters.  I fully agree with him and this Bill represents one such example of better planning.  It aims to place NORA on a solid financial footing through statutory borrowings and funding through the application of the variable levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Deputy Boyle commented on the importance of an oil stockholding agency.  I am in agreement with him on this point and reiterate that the primary objectives of the Bill are concerned with ensuring the robustness of our national strategic stock holdings, ensuring that NORA has a sound financial footing, as well as enhancing appropriate corporate governance structures for the agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">I agree with Deputy Cowley that energy policy requires strong emphasis on renewable energy.  The Government is going in that direction and that will be even more apparent following the publication of the Green Paper next Sunday.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I thank Members from all sides for their very constructive input on Second Stage.  I look forward to early consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I ask the members of the select committee to table any amendments as quickly as possible to allow them to be given full consideration by my officials and me.  I will try to ensure that the Government's amendments are submitted as early as possible to allow full consideration of them.</p>

            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_846">make all inspection reports directly available to residents of nursing homes and their families and accessible to the public, free of charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">I wish to share time with Deputies Crawford, Connaughton and McManus.  When the House discusses Private Members' motions concerning the health services, all Members get a sense of <i>déjà vu</i>.  The same territory is gone over repeatedly, with little or no change or improvement to the health services.  The Private Members’ motions I have tabled in this House included one on the North Eastern Health Board.  Today however, Members discussed the report on the death of P. J. Walsh in the very same area debated in a Private Members’ motion nearly two years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">More than one year ago, the House debated a Private Members' motion on the need for a social services inspectorate, which again is central to tonight's debate.  Moreover, the House has debated another issue central to tonight's debate in a Private Members' motion, namely, accident and emergency departments.  Hence, there is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> and of the present Government doing little to improve the health services.  This is certainly the case in respect of debates on Private Members’ motions.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">I wish to outline a brief history as to what has happened regarding care of the elderly in the past five years, as this is the basis of tonight's motion.  It started well, with the publication in 2001 of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness — a Health System for You.  The strategy included the establishment of a social service inspectorate on a statutory basis, as well as the promise of legislation regarding elderly patients' entitlements.  As it was published nearly five years ago, one would expect some progress regarding these issues.  However, there has been little.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">In July 2003, the former Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, who championed himself as a man who looked after the elderly, made a statement.  In the Official Report, 1 July 2003, vol. 570, col. 474, he stated: "[At] present health boards are involved in the preparation of draft standards of care for residential institutions for older people".  However, like the former Minister of State himself, this appears to have gone by the wayside.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">Although the process of revolutionising the health services was begun enthusiastically by the Government, the first storm clouds began to gather in or around 2003.  This was also when the Mercer and O'Shea reports regarding the future funding of care for the elderly were published.  The then Minister again promised immediate action.  Unfortunately, by 2004, the former Minister for Health and Children in question, Deputy Martin, had his own problems to deal with because of the Travers report's publication.  The latter both demonstrated the ineptitude of Ministers in respect of the health services and of care of the elderly in particular, and showed how little was being done by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">Hence, while matters regarding the health service began well in 2001, by 2004 things were going downhill rapidly and one can see why.  In 2005, another watershed took place when the "Prime Time Investigates" documentary exposed what was happening in nursing homes.

            <p eId="para_859">In June 2005, the first report on Leas Cross, namely, the Hynes report was published.  It also exposed many matters which are still under discussion tonight.  What has been done since its publication?  Nothing appears to stir either the Minister of State or his colleagues into action in respect of care of the elderly.  The Minister for Health and Children, who prides herself on being a can-do Minister, stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_860">on the social services inspectorate, we will have the legislation ready later this year.  The Minister for State, Deputy Power, is working on it.  I am optimistic that we will have an appropriate inspectorate for our nursing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">While she may have been optimistic, this was stated in July 2005.  Again, I have not seen anything happen.  In addition, the Cabinet established the interdepartmental working group on future funding of care of the elderly at this time.  However, as the House discovered earlier today, little has happened in this respect either.</p>

            <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
            <p eId="para_863">I am simply reading from the Official Report.  I will move on to 2006, by which time the Government had promised that everything would be different.  However, 2006 did not start well due to the publication of the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital report and the recommendations by Judge Harding Clark to make improvements in the health service a priority.  Little has been done in respect of that report.  At the time, the Minister for Health and Children noted that doing nothing was not an option.  Obviously, as far as care of the elderly is concerned, this is quickly fading from the Government's memory.  In the Official Report, 1 February 2006, vol. 613, col. 1705, the Minister for Health and Children stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_864">The legislation providing for the establishment of the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis is being incorporated into the Bill establishing the health information and quality authority, HIQA.  The preparation of the heads of this Bill is at an advanced stage in my Department and I expect to be in a position to submit them to Government within the next month.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">At the time, the Minister also spoke of how important the social services inspectorate would be and that she would establish a working group.  She referred to another working group with membership drawn from "[her own] Department, the HSE, the social services inspectorate and the Irish Health Service Accreditation Board".  This working group was established in February 2006.  Interestingly however, while the same Irish Health Service Accreditation Board produced its own recommendations on standards in nursing homes the previous November, nearly a year later Members still await their publication by the Department.  Hence, setting up working groups about which one does nothing is a pure waste of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">Matters have become so bad that the owners of private nursing homes have published their own standards.  The Excellence Ireland Quality Association published its own standards as to what should be expected in nursing homes.  The difficulty for such owners is that the standards are non-statutory and non-binding.  Hence, anyone who so wishes may continue following the practices operated at Leas Cross.  Deputy O'Dowd will outline how weak those standards are in those nursing homes which exploit elderly people.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">In the Official Report, 1 June 2006, vol. 620, col. 1845, the Minister for Health and Children stated: "Last year, beds were offered that were not procured because of the results of previous inspections."  Hence, although the health boards themselves do not act on these inspections, she continued by stating: "I accept that we need to strengthen the law in this area".  Again, this gives the impression that somehow, realisation has dawned on the Minister for Health and Children that she must do something about this major issue.  Even the Taoiseach, in the Official Report, 14 June 2006, vol. 621, col. 1058, stated: "I have announced many times that the legislation in question is being prepared" and we "hope to pass this legislation later this year after it has benefited from the wisdom of the consultation process". — Official Report, 14 June 2006, vol. 621, col. 1059.  Unfortunately, although the consultation process is long over, there is still no sign of this legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">Moreover, the O'Neill report, the second major report on the same institution, has now been completed.  The Government again refuses to publish it.  However, what is known about this report is interesting.  It states: "what occurred at Leas Cross cannot be assumed to be an isolated incident".  One of the main recommendations in the report is that the Department of Health and Children should establish a clear policy regarding care of the elderly and that a national monitoring system for vulnerable patients be established.  This is something for which all Members have called and which has been part of the Government's strategy since as long ago as October 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">I will provide the Minister of State with a brief overview as to what is happening as far as the Department of Health and Children is concerned.  In the past five years, health policy for care of the elderly has gone from being an enthusiastic hope for the future to dying a slow death.  The difficulties with the O'Shea and Travers reports and the lack of legislation for the protection of elderly patients became clear in the mid-term of the Government.  However, what transpired during 2005 and 2006 shows what happens when a Minister talks the talk but does not walk the walk.  This applies to the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the current Minister, Deputy Harney, because neither of them delivered much on solving the crisis in accident and emergency departments or in respect of the Hynes report, the hospital hygiene audit report, the report on Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital or the report into the death of Mr. P.J. Walsh.  Now we have the O'Neill report.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">During a discussion with the Minister of State this morning at a meeting of the Select Committee on Health and Children on legislation to change the subvention payments, numerous weaknesses were exposed in the legislation.  The one on which I believe most people will comment is the removal by the Government of an appeal system established under ministerial regulation, which is not included in the legislation that the Minister of State expects Members of this House to vote in favour of in the next few weeks, and in that regard people are expected to wait for guidelines to be issued by the Health Service Executive.  The position has changed from patient care being covered by regulation to now being covered by guidelines, and the Minister of State is saying this is a matter on which we must trust the HSE.  I note from the Dáil schedule that the Health Information and Quality Authority legislation, to which the Minister of State referred, will not be ready until 2007, which is a little along the lines of the song "What's Another Year".</p>

          <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_298">
            <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
            <p eId="para_871">I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me on this important issue.  The Leas Cross scandal and similar issues cannot be swept under the carpet.  It is vital that the report into that scandal should be made available.  Were it not for people such as Deputy O'Dowd and Deputy Twomey and our party leader, Deputy Kenny, this issue might never have come to the surface and information on the terrible conditions in that home might not have been revealed.  I congratulate those in the media who were prepared to expose this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">The main issue with which I want to deal is how provision will be made for the needs of the elderly in the future.  I am very fortunate, as is the Ceann Comhairle, that in County Monaghan we have facilities such as St. Mary's Hospital, which is owned by the Health Service Executive and, fortunately, it is not under the same management as some other institutions in County Monaghan.  St. Mary's Hospital is excellently run, as is the Sacred Heart Home for the Elderly in Clones, the nursing home in Ballybay and most of the other private nursing homes in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">Elderly people and people with disabilities are important members of society and we cannot allow them to be treated other than in a proper manner.  A proper nursing home inspection system must be put in place.  At a meeting yesterday we discussed EU inspections of products imported into this country and were told that the next inspection would take place on a date next January in order that everybody would know when an inspection of Brazilian beef would take place.  The only way in which nursing homes can be properly inspected is for inspectors to be able to visit them at any time, day or night, to ensure a proper service is being provided for the patients.  Nothing less will suffice.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">It is vital that such an inspection service is put in place to ensure that the necessary service is available to patients at all times in all nursing homes.  Whether patients are in public nursing homes or in private nursing homes, as are the majority, it is vital, given the amount of money being spent and allocated to these institutions, that the best service possible is available.  Care must be taken to ensure that fire safety measures, including fire drill, are up to standard, as is required in other private businesses.  We must also ensure that pest control measures, a refuse service and all such services are adequate.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">I wish to deal with the issue of the facility to make complaints.  I was contacted by a family member recently who advised me that if the family made the slightest complaint to the nursing home in question, they found they were no longer on speaking terms with the staff and the family were asked not to cause any further annoyance.  This family were paying for their loved one to be cared for in that nursing home.  There must be a clear line of communication and assistance between those in charge of administrating subvention payments and such matters and the patients and their family members.  If a personality clash arises between a patient and nursing home staff, the patient should have an option to move to another nursing home.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">In the case I dealt with, the nursing home concerned was glad when a difficult position was dealt with and the person concerned is now happy being cared for in another nursing home.  Such personality clashes can arise.  A proper structure must be in place in nursing homes whereby people can feel free to make a realistic complaint and be confident it will be dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">The administration of drugs and medicines must be clearly defined.  Most nursing homes deal with this matter very well but it must be properly organised.  Patients must have the right to refuse treatment or, in consultation with relatives acting on their behalf, to seek the best advice on proposed treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">Nursing home staff should also discuss with residents their dietary needs, including the variety and types of food they require, as food is an important consideration.  I know of a person who went into a nursing home four and half a years ago and people thought she would not be still there in a few weeks' time or at most a few months' time, but with good care she is still there and living a reasonably active life.  It is important for such residents to have the variety of food they require and their dietary needs are cared for in a reasonable way.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">I wish to deal with nursing home subventions.  There are various problems in this area in the north-east region, one being the lack of funds.  In the early 1990s, a number of patients in the area were provided for across the Border, as that opportunity was presented, and as a result we seem to have a low quota.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">A case involving a 90 plus year old patient who applied for subvention payment was brought to my attention recently.  This lady lives in an ordinary cottage which she does not own.  She was refused subvention because she said she did not have any money or accounts and those administrating the scheme did not believe her and sent her back her file.  This lady lives on her own.  She has had to pay taxi fares to go to her doctor and has incurred other expenses.  It is not difficult to understand how she has no money.  Fortunately, for the time being she has been able to go back home and is being looked after by her loved ones.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">This type of attitude towards the elderly must be seriously examined and investigated.  Sadly, this lady had no one to do a whip-round, she will have to stay at home until such time as some of us can negotiate on her behalf with the staff in the office administrating the scheme and argue that she has a valid case in that she does not have much resources and needs support.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">The Government has been in office for nine and a half years and it is time such issues were dealt with.  There is also the issue of the home help service.  The Ceann Comhairle is aware of a case in his home town where a person has the services of a home help for two hours compared with having received the services of a home help for 12 hours when living in Donegal.  There must be some degree of responsibility and realisation that people who need this service cannot live on fresh air.  They need proper and substantial help if they are to be able to live at home and not in nursing homes.</p>

            <p eId="para_885">I have taken part in a number of discussions on nursing homes in recent years.  The catalogue of failure is nothing other than a disgrace.  We all have to accept that the RTE investigation into Leas Cross represented a milestone in the evolution of nursing home care.  Never in the history of care of the elderly was anything more starkly brought across to the public about what could happen.  I am from a county where I hope and have every reason to believe that most nursing homes, at least the ones I know about, are run very well.  However, that is not enough.  When I heard about the non-publication of Professor O'Neill's report I was shocked.  I have no idea what is in the report but I have never heard a case of such a document not being published where everybody concerned had the interest of the elderly at heart.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">I assume several interests are involved, though I am not privy to them, and that there are people in very high places, whether connected to the HSE or to ancillary services, whose noses would be put out of joint if the report was published.  Does the Minister of State, or his senior Minister, know what is contained in it?  It will shame everybody if it cannot be published.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">If the will existed to publish the report it would have been published under the privilege of this House, as has been done many times before, such as with public accounts and many other reports.  Why was that not done with the O'Neill report?  Why was it not brought into the House and made public?</p>

            <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
            <p eId="para_889">I do not accept that.  This case concerns the person lying on his or her back in a nursing home anywhere in Ireland.  Nothing else counts.  It all depends on the quality of care for that person.  Nothing else matters if the appropriate care is not given to a person who lies on his or her back for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every day of his or her life.  They are the people whom we are here to protect.  Over the years we decried what happened in industrial schools.  It was a dark age but we said people did not understand.  The statutory authorities responsible for inspections did not carry them out.  In this modern age we are in the same position again.  I have said many times that for inspections of nursing homes we need a flying squad mentality.  Inspectors should be able to strike at any time, day or night, any week of the year.  If there is nothing wrong nobody should object.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">Can the Minister of State imagine the suspicion that has been aroused by the failure to bring the O'Neill report before the House?  I have no idea what is wrong with it but a great number of elderly people are beginning to wonder what it was that Professor O'Neill said about Leas Cross that prevented it being brought onto the floor of this House and made public.</p>

            <p eId="para_892">If the Minister of State or I were in the same bed as they and had a personal interest in the matter we would say exactly the same thing.  The sooner he brings the report before the House the better, irrespective of whom it hurts.  Personnel issues must be involved and vested interests must have expressed disagreement with Professor O'Neill.  If that were not the case then it would be published.  I believe the Minister of State has the best interests of the elderly at heart.  Why would he not?  There would be no marks for that as that is why we are here.  The suspicion has now been created that the O'Neill report cannot or will not be made public because of a cover-up.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">I expect that after tonight's debate the report will be put on the floor of the House for us to see its contents.  We are all adults and will all find out what the learned professor had to say.  He would not have been given the job unless somebody in the Department thought him the right person for the job.  There is no point commissioning a professional report and deciding, for a reason best known to the Government, it cannot be published.  That is what happened at Leas Cross at the very beginning.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">I sincerely hope the report is made public, irrespective of whom it hurts, because then we will know who genuinely has at heart the welfare of people who are not able to speak for themselves.  We are very lucky to have fine carers but if one person out of 15,000 is abused, for any reason, or denied their rights it is one person too many.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">I will return to where I started.  Until I see the day when a flying squad of appropriately trained men and women can walk into any nursing home, private or public, at any hour of the day or night I will know the Government does not take the situation seriously.</p>

          <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_306">
            <from>Ms McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_896">I welcome this debate and thank Fine Gael for the opportunity to speak in it.  I start by reminding the House of the statement the Minister for Health and Children made recently: "It would not be acceptable to me or the Government if this report were to remain unpublished."  However, the Minister for Health and Children has the power to guarantee publication and it is time for her to use it.  It is quite simple.  Instead of doing so, the Minister has called on the HSE and Professor O'Neill, the author of the Leas Cross report, to work together to create the conditions necessary to facilitate publication.  As far as Professor O'Neill is concerned, and according to his interpretation of the terms of reference, the report is finished and ready for publication.  It is time for the Minister to live up to her own rhetoric.  She has the legal authority to break the logjam and I urge her to use it.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">The Minister has power to issue directions to the HSE under section 10 of the Health Act 2004.  The directions may be either general or specific.  Under section 10(1), the Minister may issue general written directions to the executive "for any purpose relating to this Act or any other enactment, and concerning any matter or thing referred to in this Act as specified or to be specified, or as determined or to be determined, by the Minister".</p>
            <p eId="para_898">Under section 10(2), the Minister may issue specific written directions to the Executive "concerning the submission to the Minister, in such manner and within such period as the Minister may specify, of reports on any matter relating to Part 7 (Accountability) or relating in any other way to the performance of the Executive's functions, even though such reports are the subject of a direction under subsection (1), and any information or statistics relating to the performance of the Executive's functions".</p>
            <p eId="para_899">Subsection (5) provides that the executive must comply with a direction issued by the Minister under this Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">It therefore appears open to the Minister to direct the HSE to provide her with copies of the O'Neill report.  It also appears open to the Minister, once the report is formally in her possession, to refer it to the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  The committee could then publish it, a precedent which has been followed on previous occasions.  I was involved in such a process relating to the scandal surrounding sexual abuse in swimming.  It is within her power to do so and it is time for her to match her words with action.  The result of the ongoing failure to publish this report is the belief among many members of the public that these types of reports are commissioned but nothing ever happens.  There is no personal accountability and the track record of Ministers for Health and Children on this is not good.  The public deserves answers to the questions raised on standards of care for the elderly.  The process of reforming the way vulnerable sections of our society are treated is stuck in a bureaucratic and legal quagmire and the valid fear is that it will be left there.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">Some 16 months have passed since the screening of the "Prime Time Investigates" investigation into Leas Cross nursing home.  This was not the first time the Government's attention had been drawn to concerns that the elderly, in particular those in long-stay care, may be particularly vulnerable to human rights abuses.  The Human Rights Commission's report entitled Older People in Long Stay Care was published in November 2002.  Its concerns over the inspection of private nursing homes were clearly stated as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_902">Inspections are rarely, if ever, carried out at night; the inspection is largely concerned with the physical conditions and rarely addresses what might be termed broad quality of life or social gain issues; the Health Boards take very few prosecutions and almost never close down a nursing home.  The sort of breaches of the law which were regularly mentioned in the reports included the absence of contract of care, inadequate records of medication and the use of restraint, insufficient arrangements for privacy and the absence of safety equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">This report, which is almost four years old, elicited a response from the Department of Health and Children only seven months after its publication and even then the Department did not engage with the issues raised.  A similar indifference by the Department of Health and Children and the HSE is now being experienced with the Leas Cross report.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">In May 2005 "Prime Time Investigates" aired its investigation into Leas Cross which exposed degrading and humiliating treatment of its elderly patients.  These elderly people are some of the most vulnerable people in the State.  The treatment of these elderly patients in the care of this nursing home appalled viewers.  It became a matter of national scandal and was discussed here in this Chamber.  The images depicted so graphically on "Prime Time Investigates" were shameful for our society and it was shameful that this could happen in modern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">This is not just a case of elderly patients being stripped of their dignity but a system that is putting the health and even the lives of vulnerable, elderly patients at risk.  What we witnessed was a Government that failed in its duty of care to its most vulnerable elderly citizens.  The Government responded by making three promises: an independent nursing homes inspectorate, a team of elder abuse case workers and a report into the 95 deaths in Leas Cross.  The Government has failed on all three promises.  It has failed to publish legislation to establish an independent nursing homes inspectorate.  In the days following the "Prime Time Investigates" exposure the Taoiseach spoke in this House.  He makes many statements in this House and appears to subsequently change his tune.  On this occasion, 1 June 2005, he stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_906">Legislation to establish a proper inspectorate that will be independent of the HSE and deal with both nursing homes and children is being prepared.  The legislation will not be ready before the summer but will be introduced in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">The Department of Health and Children now tells us it will be 2007 before this legislation appears.  Appointments to the nationwide team to prevent elder abuse are critically behind schedule.  Only five of the proposed 32 elder abuse case workers have been appointed.  Although the report on the 95 deaths in Leas Cross has been ready since May this year it has not been published and it is time it was.  The author of the report, Professor Des O'Neill, has described the findings as "grave, disturbing, requiring urgent attention".  Professor O'Neill believes that the HSE's recent insistence on a "judicial form of tribunal" is outside the terms of reference as given to him.  As far as he is concerned, this report is finished and should be published.  Professor O'Neill stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_908">As it turned out, the review that I conducted gave me cause for grave concern not only as to the standards within that particular nursing home but also, as the specific terms of reference required me to consider, the wider issues as to the setting of appropriate standards and their systematic monitoring and enforcement.  As I have previously stated these concerns were grave, disturbing and system-wide, and required urgent attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">Urgent attention is the one reaction we have not seen.  The HSE's response is that this report is unpublishable, yet it must be published.  It is up to the Minister to use her statutory powers to guarantee its publication.  In the words of Mr. Dan Moore, relative of former Leas Cross resident Mr. Peter McKenna, this report must not serve as wallpaper to cover up the terrible neglect of these elderly patients.  As Mr. Moore stated on the death of his relative: "To my knowledge not one person suffered embarrassment, was fined, imprisoned, suffered loss of job, loss of status — nothing".</p>
            <p eId="para_910">The revelations of the "Prime Time Investigates" investigation resulted in elder abuse becoming top of the national agenda for a short time.  It is time to make it top of the national agenda once more and to seek to fully protect our most vulnerable citizens.  We cannot do it without having in the public arena the vital information in Professor O'Neill's report.  It is extraordinary that taxpayers are paying for this report which is of grave public concern and which they are entitled to see.  It investigates issues that affect our elderly across the board, not just in one nursing home.  Even without the report's publication the one fact we know is that the phenomenon is system-wide, and that is why it is so important that the Minister deal with it.  There are clearly wider failures in how our system cares for elderly citizens.  That does not imply that we do not have good nursing homes.  I know many people who are happy and well cared for in private nursing homes across the country.  It does a disservice to those who provide that level of care to leave them in a limbo in which they all suffer from a stigma because the information that should be published is not being made available and action is not taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">The best guarantee we have of ensuring the health service works is full transparency and accountability, which we do not have in our health service.  With the introduction of the HSE the existing levels of accountability were stripped away.  We have a serious problem with making the service accountable.  Whether in the care of the elderly or medical procedures carried out in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, without robust systems in place to ensure accountability, terrible things can be done.  Terrible things were done and thanks to media exposure we were all able to see what was happening.  While we do not know the full extent, the eminent Professor O'Neill has produced a report that will guide us through to the next stage where we can have the kind of protections and safeguards we all want to have when we are old.  Hopefully we will all age and be in the position of vulnerability.  Without this report we will not be able to make the progress we need.  The Minister has the power to make this report public.  We gave her those powers when we enacted the Health Act 2004 and I challenge her to indicate to us why she refuses to use them.</p>

            <p title="amendmentProposal" eId="para_912">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_913">To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_914">"welcomes the largest ever expansion made by the Government in funding of services for older people by the provision of €110 million additional revenue funding in the Budget announcement for 2006 (€150 million full year cost);</p>

            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_921">commends its policy of supporting older people in their homes and communities in keeping with their stated wishes, and providing support to those who need residential care, and in that context, acknowledges the legal difficulties in the HSE publishing the Leas Cross Report".</p>
            <p eId="para_922">I wish to share time with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">I welcome this opportunity to address the House on these important issues.  The Government has made a significant investment in the care of older persons and palliative care with the provision of €110 million in additional revenue funding in the budget announcement for 2006.  The full year cost of that allocation is €150 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">The Government is committed to maintaining older people in dignity and independence in their own homes, and in accordance with their wishes, for as long as possible and to provide a high quality of long-term residential care for older people when living at home is no longer possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">It is internationally recognised that about 5% of the older population will eventually require long-term care.  People are generally living longer these days, however, and even though most are leading healthy independent lives, the number of people in need of long-term care is increasing.  There is a demand on long-stay places.  It is imperative that the private nursing home places on offer are of a high enough and appropriate standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">The nursing home sector is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and subsequent regulations.  The Nursing Home (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993 set out the standards to which the private nursing home sector must adhere for the purpose of registration under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990.  These regulations apply only to the private nursing home sector and do not cover public long-stay facilities for older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">There was a commitment in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness — A Health System for You, to extend the remit of the social services inspectorate to other social services, including residential services for older people.  Legislation is therefore being prepared in the Department to provide for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority and the establishment of the social services inspectorate function, as part of the authority, on a statutory basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">Public consultation on the draft heads and general scheme of a Bill providing for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority has been carried out.  Included in the scheme is provision for the establishment of the office of the chief inspector of social services within the authority.  The office of the chief inspector will be assigned responsibility for the inspection of residential services for older people, including public nursing homes.  The Minister intends to seek Government approval as soon as possible to commence drafting the full Bill.  The Minister intends to publish the Bill during the autumn session.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">The Health Service Executive national care group manager for older persons services established a national nursing homes steering committee in July 2005.  One of the priority tasks outlined for this committee was the standardisation of inspection documentation to make the information on inspections more transparent and more easily understood by nursing home proprietors and the general public.  At the time, there were several different reporting templates in use across the country.  The HSE nursing home inspection and registration teams use a standardised reporting template on an interim basis.  The inspection report is based on the standards and criteria laid down in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993.  The HSE has commenced publishing these reports on its website.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">The decision to publish nursing home inspection reports followed considerable consultation within the HSE and with representatives of nursing homes organisations.  The nursing homes organisations have broadly welcomed this initiative.  Nursing homes are required to be registered by the HSE.  Registration certificates must be placed in a prominent position in nursing homes.  If a registration has certain conditions attached to it, these will be displayed on the registration certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_931">When it is necessary for older people to move into long-term residential care, it is important that these older people have a choice of top quality nursing home care.  For this reason, the Department has established a working group to develop the standards for residential care settings for older people.  Membership of the group comprises officials from the Department, the HSE, the social services inspectorate and the Irish Health Service Accreditation Board.  The group has commenced and developed draft standards for the inspection of public and private residential care for older people.  It is intended that these draft standards will be the subject of a public consultation process in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">In addition, the Irish Health Service Accreditation Board has examined the development of accreditation standards for public and private residential care for older people.  The Government's commitment to the development of a comprehensive range of services for older people and palliative care can be demonstrated clearly by outlining the considerable increase in resources made available in recent years for service developments.  This has resulted in a major improvement in home and community-based support for older people.  A comprehensive health and social care service is being developed, in a way that is reliable and that respects and values older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people.  These initiatives set out the Government's continued commitment to older people and putting older people at the centre of health policy now and in the future.  The investment package is focused on caring for people at home, in accordance with their expressed wishes.  It is a major step in focusing new resources on home care first and foremost, while still supporting appropriate residential care.  This is in line with international trends and reflects the growing independence of older people who want to stay living in their communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">It is right that we should devote substantial additional resources to services for older people.  They have made a great contribution to our society and to our current economic and social success.  In this way, we are saying that the next generations value their contribution and will respect their needs and their continuing role in our society.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">This new investment involves additional resources of €150 million in a full year with €110 million in 2006 and €40 million more the following year.  Reflecting the new emphasis on home and day care, almost three quarters of the full year costs are being committed to community care supports.  This investment is a response by the Government to older peoples' preference for being cared for at home rather than going into residential care.  That may often require some additional home help or more developed home support, including various therapy services.  All the evidence shows that families caring for elderly relatives continue to provide care in partnership with the support services put in place for those that require it.  It is estimated that 28% of nursing home residents have a low to moderate dependency level and many of these residents might well have continued to live at home if the right supports had been made available to them at the appropriate time.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">The budget day package provided for a number of initiatives including home care support packages which deliver a wide range of services and have been piloted successfully in several regions in recent years.  They include the services of nurses, home care attendants, home helps and various therapists including physiotherapists and occupational therapists.  A home care package will vary according to the care needs of the person so that, for example, there might be a greater emphasis in some packages on home care assistants while other packages may require a greater level of therapy and nursing.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">The priority is older people living in the community or who are inpatients in an acute hospital and who without this support would need to be admitted to long-term care.  The home care packages are also available to older people who have been admitted to long-term care and wish to return to the community.  In addition, the packages will be offered to people who are already using existing core services, such as home help, but need more assistance to continue to live in their community.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">The packages are delivered through the HSE, by a range of providers including the executive, voluntary groups and the private sector.  The scheme is intended to be as flexible as possible and highly responsive to the real needs of the individual so that where a family or friends of an older person wish to provide these services, they will be encouraged to do so, with support, and linking in with the HSE, voluntary or private sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">Approximately 1,100 home care packages were provided to people at the end of 2005.  By the end of this year a total of 2,000 additional home care packages will have been provided.  The 2,000 packages will support more than 2,000 persons as, for example, individuals could in some cases need a temporary care package.  The major thrust of this initiative is to be directed at older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">Home helps are an essential part of supporting older people at home and thereby delaying or preventing admission to long-stay residential care.  They also help to keep people out of acute hospitals or help their early discharge from hospitals.  There is a continuing demand for home helps because of the increased number of older people.  An additional €33 million full year cost has now been allocated for this programme, €30 million of which is for 2006.  This represents a significant increase over the Estimates provision of €112 million for 2005 and is used to provide 1.75 million more home help hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">Day care and respite care centres are an integral part of delivering a comprehensive community service for older people.  The service provided may include a mid-day meal, bath, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, laundry, hairdressing, social contact among older people, respite for family members and carers and social stimulation in a safe environment for older people with mild forms of dementia.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">The provision of €9 million in a full year allows for an additional 1,325 places per week in such centres.  The number of older people who will benefit from these new places will be substantially more than 1,325 since, over the whole year, one place can provide a service for more than one person.  The investment of €9 million allows for additional programmes for specific needs such as activity therapy.  It will also mean that many day care centres can open for five or seven days a week, rather than two or three days as was often the case.  There is an investment of €7 million in 2006 with the balance of €2 million being provided the following year.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">There is a significant increase in the resources available to the meals on wheels service.  An additional €2.5 million has been provided in 2006 together with a further €2.5 million in 2007.  This is part of the range of services which help support older people to continue living in their own homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">The Government strongly supports the development of sheltered housing accommodation for older people, as it provides a real alternative to residential care and reflects the desire of older people to live with as much independence as possible.  Some €1 million will be allocated in support of the development of sheltered housing, split evenly between 2006 and 2007, to provide frontline health service support for sheltered housing, such as therapists and public health nurses.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">I would like to speak about the development of the nursing home subvention scheme and the provision of additional long-stay bed capacity.  Some €20 million is being allocated under the scheme for residents of private nursing homes.  This represents an increase of 14% on 2005, when there was an estimated spend of €140 million.  The €20 million to which I referred will be used to support the increasing numbers of people who are entitled to basic nursing home subvention, to reduce the waiting lists for enhanced subventions and to bring greater consistency to the different levels of enhanced subvention support throughout the country.  Some €8 million is being provided to cover the cost of 250 additional nursing home beds which the HSE has sourced from private nursing homes.  Some €9 million was provided in this year's budget for specialist palliative care, including home care and community initiatives.  This allocation includes funding for 24 additional extended care beds in Our Lady's Hospice in Harold's Cross.  A further €4 million is being allocated in 2007 to develop palliative care services, which amounts to a full-year cost of €13 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">It is clear from the budget day package that the Government is firmly committed to developing services for older people.  The emphasis on developing home care packages and the increases in the home help and meals on wheels schemes and other community-based supports are assisting older people to remain in their homes and communities for longer, in accordance with their wishes.  As I have said, additional funding has been provided under the nursing home subvention scheme to support the increasing numbers of people who are entitled to subvention and to reduce waiting lists for enhanced subvention.  The issue of the staffing resources needed by the statutory inspectorate is being explored by the stakeholders in the overall context of ensuring that standards are met and health service staff are utilised in the most effective way.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">The motion before the House deals with Professor O'Neill's report into the deaths at Leas Cross nursing home and refers to the question of an independent inspection regime.  It highlights a lack of information and transparency in respect of the standards which apply to nursing homes.  I spoke earlier about the Government's commitment to introduce legislation establishing a social services inspectorate that will inspect all residential centres for older people, including public centres.  The failure to publish Professor O'Neill's report cannot be attributed to the Government as it is not a function of the Government to publish such a report.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
            <p eId="para_951">I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important issue, which affects some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, mentioned earlier, the Department of Health and Children has a policy of maintaining older people in dignity and independence in their own homes, in accordance with their wishes, for as long as possible.  Most older people are fit and well and lead full and independent lives.  The Department is committed to providing a high quality of long-term residential care when that is no longer the case.  That is the minimum we can do for older citizens, who have played a major part in helping Ireland to achieve the success it enjoys today.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">Most long-term residential care is of a high standard and affords a good quality of life to older people who benefit from it.  With the best will in the world, however, there will always be exceptions to the rule.  As there will always be circumstances in which older people feel vulnerable or exploited, the Department is committed to developing quality standards and putting in place a robust inspection process for public and private nursing homes.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has outlined the steps being taken in this regard, including the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority as well as the establishment of the social services inspectorate function on a statutory basis.  The office of the chief inspector will have the function of registering and carrying out inspections, including inspections of services for older people.  The Department has established a working group to set out the standards for residential care settings for older people.  The HSE will continue to register and inspect private nursing homes under the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">The Department of Health and Children is fully committed to developing the services needed to tackle elder abuse.  Great strides have been made in recent years in developing supports for older people who feel defenceless.  The report of the working group on elder abuse, Protecting Our Future, was launched on 11 November 2002.  As elder abuse is a complex issue, it can be difficult to define it precisely.  It may involve financial, physical or sexual abuse, or it may arise due to inadequacy of care.  It is defined in the report as "a single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person or violates their human and civil rights".  It is hoped that the report, by defining elder abuse, has given older people who feel they are the subject of abuse in any shape or form the confidence to report their anxieties, as appropriate, to a social worker, a public health nurse, a member of the Garda or any professional or care worker.  The Health Service Executive recently established a helpline service, which can be accessed by dialling 1850 241850, dedicated to dealing with allegations of elder abuse.  It should encourage those who feel they are being abused in any way, or those who witness such abuse, to make the necessary contact and have their voices heard.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">The importance the Government attaches to the issue of elder abuse is reflected by its allocation of €2 million in this year's budget to address it, split evenly between 2006 and 2007.  Some €2.5 million has been made available in recent years to implement the recommendations of the report.  The funding allocated over the next two years will facilitate the implementation of the full range of recommendations.  It will help to put in place dedicated elder abuse officers and clerical support workers in each local health office area.  It will also provide for the development of a research function in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">The report recommends that a senior case worker be appointed to each former community care area.  It is anticipated that the HSE will recruit 27 senior case workers soon.  One of the responsibilities of the senior case workers, in conjunction with appropriate health service providers, will be to assess suspected cases of elder abuse referred to local health offices.  One of the recommendations in the elder abuse report was the establishment of a national implementation group.  The group was established in December 2003.  In 2005, the Department appointed a senior policy adviser and a secretary to assist the implementation group in its work.  The HSE recently appointed a senior officer to assist the group with implementation issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">The HSE has made good progress on the issue of elder abuse.  It has implemented a number of the report's recommendations, including the establishment of steering groups in each former health board area to provide a common response to elder abuse throughout the State.  The steering groups comprise representatives of the public sector, private organisations and voluntary organisations, including groups for older people.  The groups are developing clear policies and guidelines for the protection of vulnerable adults, on foot of wide consultation with staff.  They are progressing their work through the subgroups on legal aspects, policy and procedures and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">The Health Service Executive has pointed out that awareness training for HSE staff has been provided in line with the report.  It has been involved in awareness training with volunteer staff, including staff from the national senior citizens helpline.  The issue of elder abuse is being incorporated into professional training courses including gerontology courses.  A number of research projects have been undertaken, including the examination and review of medication for older persons in continuing care settings.  In addition to these developments, a senior helpline was established with the support of the health boards in 1998.  Since 1999, it has received thousands of calls from lonely older people nationwide.  The service is confidential and non-directive and is available throughout the State for the price of a local call.  The volunteers working on the helpline are all older people who have gone through a rigorous training provided in conjunction with the health authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">The helpline handles all manner of issues and is not geared specifically towards complaints about elder abuse, such as the helpline recently set up by the Health Service Executive.  However, 5% of calls in 2004 related to elder abuse.  These callers established a relationship of trust over a period with the older volunteers taking their calls.  Many callers were often unable to seek external or professional intervention until they felt secure in discussing their situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">The House will agree the Department of Health and Children has taken strides in tackling the issue of elder abuse.  It has worked for the past several years, in conjunction with the HSE, to ensure awareness of the issue, both among the public and staff who come into contact with older people during the course of their work.  The HSE has made good headway in putting in place structures at local and national level to deal with allegations of elder abuse.  It continues to provide appropriate training to staff in this regard.  The national implementation group continues to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the report on elder abuse.  The Department has allocated the highest level of funding for elder abuse for the next two years to ensure these recommendations become reality.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">Developments in this area must be considered in the wider context of standards of care.  The Department is committed to developing person-centred standards that reflect best practice and will ensure older people in residential care receive a level of quality care that is centred around their needs.  The Department is putting in place the legislative structures to ensure these standards are complied with consistently in all residential settings for older people.  Such developments cannot be achieved overnight, but the House will agree the Department is progressing well and is fully committed towards these ends.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">These developments are taking place in the wider context of developments in services for older people.  An interdepartmental working group was established to review several complex and fundamental policy issues in long-term care for older people.  Some of these issues were the subject of the Mercer report on financing long-term care and the O'Shea review of the nursing home subvention scheme.  Following consideration of the group's report, a series of key principles to inform policy were endorsed by the Government and incorporated in the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">These principles include, for example, that there should be one, standardised national needs assessment for older people needing care.  The use of community and home-based care should be maximised while sheltered housing options will be encouraged.  Where residential care is required, it should be quality care and there should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  The level of support for residential care should be indifferent as to whether that care is in a public or private facility.  The financial model to support any new arrangements must also be financially sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">The agreement also describes a range of initiatives covering new arrangements for residential and community care for older people.  Progress to date in progressing actions in the long-term care report includes the HSE developing a national standardised care needs assessment and a standardised financial assessment process for home care packages.  A needs analysis of residential care requirements for older people has been finalised by HSE.  National protocols for case management for home care packages are being developed by the HSE as part of the guidelines' roll-out.  A planning exercise on staffing requirements for future developments for older people and the disabled is being undertaken by Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  A cross-departmental team on sheltered housing will be established and chaired by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Work will include other groups such as the disabled.  A steering committee will be set up to begin the preparatory work of evaluating the effectiveness of the additional home care packages.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">Work is continuing on the development of a financially sustainable system of funding long-term care.  Standard consultation with carers' representative organisations, on a cross-departmental basis, will be led by Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The interdepartmental group has continued to meet to assist in drawing up proposals for a new policy on long-term care, based on the principles endorsed by Government and the social partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">Deputies will agree these measures on elder abuse and the continuing work in developing a new policy on long-term care, as well as the budgetary and other measures outlined by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, outline the Government's commitment to improving services for older people.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_966">Not one of the two Ministers of State from the Department of Health and Children addressed the key issue of Leas Cross and Professor O'Neill's report on it.  Their speeches were the reiteration of recycled words which mean nothing.  The truth is that until legislation covering nursing homes, promised as long ago as 2001, is introduced, we will not be able to provide our elderly people in nursing homes with the protection they need.  All the waffle from the Ministers of State does not address the key issue.  There were no words of condemnation from the Government on what happened at Leas Cross.  There were no words of concern about the deaths at Leas Cross.  There was no concern that on average people in other nursing homes lived up to 44 months after entering while in Leas Cross the average was seven months.  The Government is inept and it does not care.  It has been in power too long.  It has failed to implement the changes it promised and it does not have the guts to take on the bureaucrats who are trying to hide this report and prevent it from coming into the public domain.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">I understand there are precedents for bringing into this House reports that may allegedly cause problems.  Deputy Paul McGrath reminded me of the report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which was published through a committee of the House.  Other examples include the Kelly Fitzgerald report and the Ferns Report.  The Leas Cross report is about people who died, many of whom were moved to this facility from the care of the State in St. Ita's Hospital.  Others were moved to Bedford House.  Their deaths are a grave concern to everybody involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">Professor Des O'Neill has described the report as a damning indictment of the system and of the Health Service Executive.  The Government has failed miserably and utterly in discharging its statutory duty of care and protection to these most vulnerable people.  This country consists of two Irelands.  One of these is the wealthy Ireland comprising the business people who can support the Taoiseach by giving him money and the developers and politicians who appear at tribunals.  The other Ireland, the hidden, dark side of our country, is seen in the many selfish people who are concerned only with looking after themselves and in the lack of care and respect for elderly people.  This is not to say that many good people who work hard do not place family members in the care of nursing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">Professor O'Neill's report identifies the issues clearly and accurately both in terms of administration and in regard to the absolute system failure in the Health Service Executive northern area.  The truth contained in this report is crying out for recognition because it is the voice of the people who have suffered.  It is what we must listen to and know.  It is what is being hidden, what the Government does not intend to publish because it lacks the will, courage and interest.  The reality is it could not care less.  Thankfully, this report will see the light of day because we have an Information Commissioner who put pressure on the system and the Government, even though that Government changed the law to make it more difficult for the truth to emerge.  The truth will out and the longer the Government continues in office the more negligent it will be because it still has not produced the necessary legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">Our motion refers to the failure of the Government and the broken promises of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children to introduce legislation in this area.  In a debate in 2001, the then Minister of State promised such legislation but nothing has been done.  Concerns were expressed in the Dáil by Deputy Kenny early in 2005.  Of particular concern was the case of Mr. Peter McKenna who was admitted to St. Michael's House against the wishes of his family.  How could this happen?  Why was no way found to meet the needs of this family who felt so strongly that their relative should not be put in this home?  Where was the energy and drive to question and address the situation in Leas Cross?  Where is the effort to protect and support such people?</p>
            <p eId="para_971">We know from a recent episode of "Prime Time" that the family of Peter McKenna has had little satisfaction from the HSE.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, met family members and offered her support.  Will she now take the necessary steps to ensure they get comprehensive answers from the HSE and St. Michael's House?  Will the Minister take responsibility and appoint a third party to assist them in their efforts?</p>
            <p eId="para_972">I have files of information that leave me in no doubt there are other nursing homes in which the same problems exist as those in Leas Cross.  It is strange, however, that when I wrote to the Department of Health and Children some years ago on this issue, it seemed to have no files.  On 31 May 2001, when I was a Member of the Seanad, the then South Western Health Board wrote to me in reply to a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act in relation to copies of nursing home inspections where significant breaches of the regulations were noted.  Some 12 nursing homes are mentioned in this letter but I will refer to only four of them, Bedford House, Fairways, Rostrevor and Rathfarnham.  Almost five years later, three of those remain open and still represent cause for concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">I called for an investigation into Bedford House in this House some time ago.  It was giving rise to concern at that time and the situation remains the same.  I am in possession of a file on the facility, which runs up to 2005, and it is clear no changes have been made to address these concerns.  The law requires every nursing home to have a matron or other similarly qualified person in charge who must work full time in that home.  However, the matron at Bedford House was, at the same time, also in charge of another nursing home in Castlebellingham in a different health board area.  How did this happen?  How can the Minister of State stand over his speeches today when he has failed to investigate such basic issues, which the health board identified five years ago?</p>
            <p eId="para_974">When I received the file on the Fairways nursing home, which I have in my possession, it was closed.  I examined some coroner's reports relating to deaths that took place there, which I have in my office and will be glad to give to the Minister of State.  Before that nursing home closed it was bought by a couple who put a Montessori teacher in charge of the residents.  The home was run for some months by that person who had no medical qualifications.  A report on one death indicated that the health board insisted on the appointment of a matron and a suitable person was eventually appointed.  The Department's inquiry must include an investigation of this issue.  The coroner's reports also showed that files on all the patients in this nursing home were destroyed.  These events took place under the Minister of State's watch.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">The Minister of State's promises are seen to be absolutely hollow when one considers the case of Rostrevor nursing home.  The then health board went to the High Court to close this home because of its deep concern for the quality of care it provided.  The court said the board did not have the power in law to seek its closure through the court.  The judge's decision was that the law was not strong enough to offer that type of protection.  The health board had to return to the District Court and approximately one year after the initiation of the prosecution, it secured a fine of €8,000 against the nursing home.  I am not sure how long the Minister of State has been in office but the law was shown by the High Court, more than a year ago, as inadequate to allow the State to close down a nursing home that was acknowledged as appalling and unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">Rathfarnham nursing home was another facility that was significantly breaching the regulations in 2001.  Last year, a medical doctor who inspected the home wrote to the health board that he could no longer stand over the continued operation of the home because of the quality of care within it.  This is the home where two patients were buried without death certificates.  A successful prosecution was brought against it for breaches of the Food Hygiene Act.  This facility must be investigated with the same level of forensic analysis as Professor O'Neill used in examining Leas Cross.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">The message for the Minister of State and the Government is that there has been a consistent systems failure for some years, both legally and practically.  The law does not allow the Minster of State at the Department of Health and Children to close a bad nursing home.  There are many nursing homes similar to Leas Cross.  I have a list of nursing homes where time and again the inspector recommended a nursing home be closed and requested legal advice.  This recommendation and request is repeated year after year.  These homes happen to be in the Kildare area.  I do not mean to imply anything by this because I do not know their names.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">There was a case in Kildare of a nursing home with no food.  The same occurred in Kilkenny — not a packet of cornflakes, a bowl of porridge nor a pint of milk.  This is what is going on.  I only know all this because I used the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">The Government knows what is going on because it changed the law.  It changed regulations to make it more difficult for people like me to get information on nursing homes.  The Government is hiding behind bureaucracy, failing in its duty of care and failing to provide transparency and openness.  On moral issues of care and concern, looking after those most vulnerable, it has utterly failed.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">One can study any county and find the same failures.  This is not to say that there are no excellent nursing homes.  We should support those homes and put them up in lights.  People should see inspectors' reports on the Internet which will indicate which homes offer the best quality care.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">There are many fine nursing homes.  There is one in my county of Louth.  Every year they invite the whole community to come in, and they have families visiting and a band playing.  They encourage intellectual activities and provide physiotherapy.  Nowadays many nursing homes are full of people staring into space owing to a lack of stimulation.  Such homes lack services.  People are left to rot and die in many cases because the effort is not expended to provide services like plant therapy, gardening and pet therapy.  How many old people would find a pet a comfort?  We are failing in our duty of care.  We are utterly, totally and abysmally failing.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The message is clear: "Prime Time", RTE, <i>The Sunday Independent, The Irish Times, </i>the <i>Irish Independent </i>and the <i>Irish Examiner </i>take up these issues when they can, provided we are not in a crisis, like tonight, over other issues.  The focus is once again on the quality of care provided to the elderly and the lack of action, care and concern from this Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">I recently received a complaint about another nursing home.  It was a sad case because the lady involved, who had suffered a stroke, was forced from her bed to have a shower.  She was brought down to have a meal while very upset and, unfortunately, passed away.  The staff were told not to mention the incident to anyone.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">There are people in distress in many nursing homes as we speak.  I know of another home where a patient was visited by a nurse.  The nurse noticed that his leg looked bad, it was going black and gangrenous.  She recommended he be taken immediately to a hospital.  His leg was amputated and he would have died if he had merely stayed in the home.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">Questions hang over the medical profession — not whether they are failing to do their best, but what criteria are in place.  What standards do the Irish Medical Organisation and other professional bodies apply regarding checklists for doctors working in nursing homes?  There is an issue that arises often relating to drugs not being signed off by a doctor.  Often the doctor lives some distance from the nursing home and a repeat prescription is provided, but the patient is not always medically examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">There are issues relating to the role of nurses.  Medical professionals are excellent in most cases but not all.  I would like to hear from those working in the homes mentioned, those who have not done their jobs.  The extension of this law requiring greater transparency on nursing homes is a good thing.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">Inspection reports are published on the Health Service Executive website.  I will not name the homes involved, there are not many of them, but I am pleased that the practice has commenced.  There were 27 patients in one of the homes mentioned.  The first sentence states the inspector agrees the number of residents can be increased to 29.  That sounds fine until one reads further on.  It is stated that there are not enough staff on duty in the home and more trained personnel are required, especially at night.  This is contradictory.  How can a nursing home increase its number of patients while those patients are not receiving the quality of care they require?</p>
            <p eId="para_988">I have grave concerns because I do not see any quality control.  Other reports are a complete whitewash.  Homes with 100 beds, similar to Leas Cross, are covered in a single page stating it meets most, not all, the legislative requirements.  That is not a satisfactory inspection report, especially if it is not signed. There is not enough detail.  I acknowledge that things are changing slowly but we need much more action.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">The issues have not changed in five years.  This Government has neglected its duty of care to the elderly and has not addressed the issue tonight.  Government speakers have mentioned neither Leas Cross nor Professor Des O'Neill.  This Government is offering only silence, stonewalling and secrecy on the issue of nursing home care and care of the elderly.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">The report by Professor Des O'Neill is in the hands of the HSE at the moment.  One of the people in charge of examining that report is named in it.  I do not think that person should be involved in deciding whether the report should be released, however tangentially he or she is mentioned.  This must be addressed immediately because it is unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">The public will not allow this Government's failure to continue.  Unless this legislation is brought in immediately, vulnerable people in nursing homes throughout the country will go without protection.  Many cannot speak for themselves, many suffer from Alzheimer's disease and many have no relatives visiting them.  The change must come.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">I acknowledge that a Bill is coming before this House next week offering voting rights to prisoners and I have no problem with that.  However, I have a problem with the fact that this legislation on nursing homes does not predate that Bill.  It is far more important to give priority to proper care for the elderly than to voting rights to prisoners, although I do not have a problem with the latter.</p>

            <from>Mr. Allen</from>
            <p eId="para_993">I am convinced that a UN force for Darfur is needed now and not in two or three month's time.  We should immediately strengthen the African Union force while the UN force is being assembled and we should prioritise the delivery of aid to those at risk.  Estimates of the casualties from the Darfur conflict which has been raging since early 2003 vary widely.Many non-governmental organisations estimatethat the number of deaths may have alreadyreached 400,000, a figure provided by theCoalition for International Justice.  The website <i>www.savedarfur.org</i> also estimates that more than 400,000 people have died in Darfur, with up to 2.5 million having been displaced.  The crisis does not end there as many more people are at risk of starvation as a result of the ongoing humanitarian disaster in that region.  In fact, more than 3 million people are completely reliant on humanitarian aid for survival.  </p>
            <p eId="para_994">The conflict in Darfur is a blight on our globe and a shame on the civilised world.  Death, destruction and mayhem have been visited on the civilian population in the most appalling manner.  Ireland and all its partners in the international community who believe in peace and justice must use every possible method to bring about peace in Darfur.  On 31 August last, the UN Security Council approved resolution 1706 which called for a new UN peace keeping force for the region.  Since then, however, a UN force has not been deployed and the only progress seen in recent weeks has been the extension of the African Union mission in Sudan until the end of this year.  While the extension of the mission is a welcome step, this force is not sufficient in the light of what the UN has called for and mandated as part of resolution 1706.  That force is the minimum response required in terms of the protection of civilians in Darfur.  Much more is needed and a full UN force should be deployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">The government of Sudan has strongly objected to resolution 1706 and said that it would deem UN forces in the region as foreign invaders.  However, the Sudanese government has backed the militia involved in the appalling genocide in Darfur and has been complicit in a campaign of ethnic cleansing for many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">The international community must continue to press for the deployment of a full UN peace keeping mission for the region.  We must press for this with absolute conviction and without wavering on the fundamental need for such a force.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, as represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, should take this opportunity to put on the record the diplomatic efforts made by the Irish Government to impress on the Sudanese Government the fact that Ireland supports the deployment of a full UN force in Darfur.  Ireland must be to the fore in calling for this force to be dispatched to the region and must use every possible method, including diplomatic, aid and trade channels at European and international level, to ensure that such a force is realised.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">Time is not on our side.  Each day the conflict continues without international action the casualty list grows even longer.  In recent weeks the situation in Darfur has worsened considerably.  Incidents of murder, rape and torture are increasing and the situation faced by many in the region, especially the displaced, is increasingly perilous.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">The conflict in Darfur must be brought to an end and I wish to see the immediate deployment of the already authorised UN peace keeping force.  In addition, the under staffed African Union force already in Darfur must be strengthened until the UN force is deployed.  Given the numbers living in grave danger of starvation, the international community must increase humanitarian aid and prioritise the delivery of essential supplies needed by the people.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">This is an horrendous situation and a blot on the good name of civilisation.  People in this part of the world must rise to the challenge that Darfur poses.  The people of the region must not be abandoned just because they are on the African continent.</p>

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_314">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1000">I speak on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who is on official business in New York, where he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly yesterday.  He also met the Sudanese Foreign Minister and the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan.  In both meetings the Darfur issue was top of the agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">The Government has consistently made clear that it is gravely concerned about the continuing humanitarian and political crisis in Darfur and is using all avenues to urge concerted international action to resolve them.  We have been very active bilaterally, at EU level and in the UN context.  In July the Minister was the first EU Foreign Minister to visit Darfur since the signature of the May peace agreement and he had the chance to visit the largest displaced persons' camp at Abu Shouk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">As the Minister stated when he addressed the General Assembly yesterday, the suffering of the people of Darfur shames the world.  We cannot indefinitely stand by and watch with horror from the sidelines.  The Sudanese government has a clear responsibility and if it fails to act the international community will have to consider possible further measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">In his address, the Minister emphasised the three essential needs of the people of Darfur.  First, humanitarian aid must be delivered safely and without restrictions.  Since 2004, Ireland has provided more than €11 million in emergency aid to Darfur, including food and shelter assistance to displaced populations across the region.  In response to the recent deterioration in the humanitarian situation, a further €1 million in humanitarian assistance for Sudan was recently approved.  Ireland has also continuously insisted that all parties in Darfur must allow unhindered humanitarian access.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">Second, there must be an international peace keeping force with a robust mandate.  As decided by the UN Security Council on 31 August 2006, it should be a well-equipped and substantial UN force.  The establishment of such a force was originally called for by the African Union and is fully supported by that body.  It is regrettable and unacceptable that the Sudanese government continues to oppose the deployment of this UN force.  Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern appealed strongly and urgently to the Sudanese government to agree to its deployment.  With our EU partners, Ireland is encouraging influential African countries and other states, such as China, to convey similar strong messages to the authorities in Khartoum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">Until transition to a UN mission takes place, AMIS, the cease fire observation mission in Darfur established by the African Union, should be strengthened as far as possible.  The Government welcomes the decision taken on 20 September 2006 by the African Union to extend the mandate of AMIS until 31 December 2006.  The size of the force is also to be increased to 8,500 troops and the UN will provide 180 logistical and technical support personnel.  The EU has given extensive political, technical and financial support to AMIS, including more than €413 million since 2004.  Ireland has provided €3 million, including €1.5 million pledged in July, to ensure that AMIS has the necessary resources to fulfil its mandate through to the end of this year.  Four personnel from the Permanent Defence Forces have also served with AMIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">However, while the creation of a so-called "AMIS-plus" is welcome so far as it goes, it does not provide a solution.  Energetic international efforts must continue to pursue the deployment of a full UN force.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">Third, long-term security can only be guaranteed by the full implementation of the Darfur peace agreement.  Ireland urges those parties which have not yet signed it to do so as soon as possible and commit to its full implementation.  More also needs to be done to widen the political basis of support for the agreement within Darfur itself.  Early inauguration of the Darfur-Darfur dialogue, provided for in the agreement, would be invaluable in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, at his meeting with the Sudanese Foreign Minister, Mr. Lam Akol, yesterday in New York, emphasised the three issues to which I referred.  In response, Mr. Akol accepted there were genuine concerns regarding the humanitarian circumstances in Darfur.  He said they are exacerbated by groups who are not on ceasefire continuing to fight the Sudanese Government.  He welcomed the extension of AMIS to the end of 2006 and also stated the Sudanese authorities will hold discussions with the United Nations and the African Union on its concerns regarding Security Council Resolution 1706, which provides for the sending of a UN force to Darfur.  This indication of Sudan's willingness to continue dialogue with the international community is welcome, but it must lead to concrete early decisions and follow-up.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stressed that if the Sudanese Government has any genuine concerns regarding the role and remit of the UN force, he is sure they can be resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">Ultimately the conflict in Darfur requires a political solution.  This is the compelling message at this crucial juncture in Sudan's history.  Ireland will continue to use every opportunity, both bilaterally and in collaboration with its EU partners, to get the Government of Sudan to accept a UN force in Darfur.</p>

          <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_315">
            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_1010">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment.  I am glad to see the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">I raised the difficulties in Ballina on a great many occasions and on a weekly basis in Dáil Éireann.  It is certainly an unemployment blackspot.  Although the Minister might dispute this, the reality is that 1,000 jobs have been lost over nine years and have not been replaced.  Any area that loses so many jobs is in trouble.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">There are construction and service industries in Ballina but they are just giving the impression that things are happening.  However, the jobs are not industrial jobs.  The industrial base has been significantly weakened thanks to the closure of a series of very valuable industries in the area, such as Asahi, Hennigans and Oasis.  Since I raised this in the Dáil, Duffy's Bakery has lost 42 jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">Ballina, the capital of north Mayo, with its large population, is an unemployment blackspot.  I previously referred to the unemployment rate of 11%, which is twice the national average, and stated there are more on the live register there than in County Roscommon.  This speaks for itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">We clearly need proper infrastructure.  The IDA says the lack of infrastructure is the difficultly and this has been raised time and again.  Progress on the N26 and Ballina-Bohola bypass seemed to stop in mid-stream.  Construction took place as far as Carrowntreila but was never completed.  We need infrastructure such as a proper industrial site and it is a scandal that there is still none.  The issue of the 27-acre industrial park on the Sligo road has been ongoing for almost a decade.  It is a total fiasco and an indictment of the failure of the local authority, in association with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, to address the very serious unemployment that exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">The area is crying out for some positive initiatives.  The Taoiseach was in Ballina about two weeks ago with Dara Calleary, the Fianna Fáil hopeful.  I asked the Taoiseach what he was doing for Ballina and whether he would make a positive statement about the town before he left.  He went around the town with Mr. Calleary but said nothing about the terrible situation that exists there.  Worse still, he did not take my advice and make a positive statement on what could be done.  The problem is due to a lack of infrastructure and balanced regional development, to which the Government says it is committed.  However, it is just paying lip service to the idea because there is almost a €3.9 billion underspend under the national development plan.  The reality is that the area is uncompetitive.  If people are to develop the area, proper investment is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">I raised this issue in the Dáil with the Minister previously and he made all sorts of promises that there would be action and stated the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, etc., were doing wonderful things.  I was told progress on the 27-acre site on the Sligo road was at an advanced stage but there is still no progress although it is the end of September.  This is intolerable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">In March the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, expressed regret at the Oasis closure and said there would be positive developments.  However, there were none.  He stated it was a great priority to find alternative employment for those who lost their jobs but this has not been done either.  The IDA is supposed to be doing all sorts of things and bringing all sorts of people to set up industry in Ballina but this has not happened.  How could it happen when there is no industrial site?</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">There was talk of prioritising expenditure in the BMW area but it amounts to nothing.  The Minister is very confident that the State development agencies will strengthen, promote and market Ballina and north Mayo but it is just more words.  The time for words is long gone and I hope the Minister will do something more positive than the Taoiseach, rather than just giving me the same old line that so much is happening.  The reality on the ground is that jobs are continuing to be lost, and those affected are real people.  The job losses at Duffy's Bakery serve as another example.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1019">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">I was very concerned to hear that the company in question has announced it will reduce its workforce during October and November.  According to the company, this difficult decision was taken due to the non-viability of the wholesale section of the business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">I am very conscious of the effect these job losses will have on the workers involved, their families and the community in the surrounding area.  This is very distressing news for those who will lose their jobs as a result of the announcement.  I assure the people concerned that the State agencies will provide every support they can and that the priority will be to find alternative employment for those involved at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">The role of FÁS, the State training agency, will be particularly important in assisting those who are about to lose their jobs.  The agency has already made contact with the company and is awaiting a response from it so a convenient date for a meeting can be agreed.  The full range of the agency's services will be made available to the employees concerned if they wish to avail of them.  These include training, education and helping people secure alternative employment in other enterprises in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">The industrial development agencies will be making every effort to secure alternative investment and employment for Ballina.  The national spatial strategy provides a framework for achievement of this goal through the prioritisation of development and investment in the gateway and hub locations.  On this basis, IDA Ireland seeks to attract foreign direct investment into the linked hubs of Ballina and Castlebar.  The authority is promoting Ballina for new foreign investment as well as working with the existing base of overseas companies in Ballina to encourage them to grow and expand.  Since January 2003, there have been five first-time site visits to Ballina.  The authority's sectoral emphasis is on attracting new knowledge-intensive projects in the medical technologies, life sciences, information and communications technology and international services sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">The authority is also working closely with local groups, utility providers, the local authorities in the county and other agencies to enhance the attractiveness of the county, including Ballina, for new investment.  In that regard, the authority has been deeply involved with local partners in the development of regional planning guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">The Deputy mentioned the industrial park and referred to failure.  It is important in a debate such as this that we be straight and upfront.  One cannot blame IDA Ireland for the logjam in the courts.  I understand that a particular legal difficulty, which is extremely unfortunate, is holding up the development of a very important property solution that would facilitate the attraction of inward investment.  It is not enough simply and straightforwardly to attack a State agency as if the situation were its fault.</p>

A new Enterprise Ireland supported high potential start-up company, Heatsolve Limited, commenced operations in Ballina in 2005.  I was with it in South Africa last week.  Enterprise Ireland has committed funding of over €700,000 to the IRD North Mayo-West Sligo Limited for the development of enterprise space in Ballina.  As the Deputy is aware, I officially opened the centre during my visit to Ballina in January 2006.  His colleague, Dara Calleary, was there to meet me in the company of Deputy Carty and Frank Chambers.  Dara Calleary was very strong on identifying needs in Ballina, and the Deputy is correct in detecting his interest in the situation, with that of Deputy Carty.  I should point out that in August 2005——</p>

            <from>Mr. Cregan</from>
            <p eId="para_1041">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise what to my constituents is an extremely important matter.  I also thank the Minister for his presence.  We raise matters on the Adjournment on several occasions over the year and it is not always possible for the appropriate Minister to reply.  Tonight he shows by his presence how seriously he is treating the imminent demise of Castlemahon Food Products Limited in west Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">Yesterday was a bad and bleak day for workers in Castlemahon and growers in the area.  I will start on a positive note by saying that we still have a chance to salvage at least part of that operation.  It is extremely important that we think positively.  I know that there are moves afoot as we speak to try to ensure that.  We should preface our remarks by being positive and trying to encourage everyone with the responsibility of playing a part to come on board.  I am of course seriously concerned for the 300 workers who face an extremely bleak few months approaching Christmas.  They are predominantly young people who have taken on commitments in life and who need a week's wages coming into their house.  In some cases both partners are being affected, and we must make every effort to ensure that we can save as many of those jobs as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">Second, the growers are predominantly small farmers on family holdings around the Castlemahon area and a little farther afield.  Some 80 to 100 growers are dependent on the income that they received from the production of chicken for the Castlemahon processing unit, having diversified from dairying.  We must try to ensure that a market can be secured for those growers.  The best possible market is that which they have locally in Castlemahon.  We must reinvigorate the Castlemahon brand name, which is famous all over the country and the UK.  It is very important that we do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">A worst-case scenario is Castlemahon's total demise, which I certainly hope does not occur.  In that event, I will call on the Minister, his Department and all the statutory agencies to come on board and make every effort to ensure that they step up to the plate for Castlemahon and west Limerick in general.  We have not had a positive response from the IDA or Enterprise Ireland for many years in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">I recognise that we have had massive investment and support for indigenous industry in west Limerick.  We have seen many jobs created, but when five, ten or 20 jobs are created, we do not have a fanfare of announcements or recognise their value to our communities.  They are valuable, and I hope that we can continue creating such posts.  I acknowledge the support of the county enterprise board, West Limerick Resources, Shannon Development and others in that regard.  However, as I have said, IDA Ireland has a case to answer for west Limerick and I hope that it will now step up to the mark and help in whatever way it can to ensure success.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">This comes hot on the heels of the demise of Kantoher, part of the Kerry Group, which was also a chicken-processing unit, 14 or 15 months ago.  I acknowledge the success story that has taken place and the efforts of everyone concerned.  The local action group or task force put in place is to be commended on its tremendous work in turning a very gloomy and sad story into something very positive.  It has been accused of being a talking shop.  I neither accept nor agree with that, since it has successfully applied for grant aid from the Minister to provide a new enterprise park in the Kantoher area.  To his credit, following a visit to the area at my request, the Minister approved the appointment of a development officer, which I believe will shortly occur.  The area has also secured a site for the enterprise project from the Kerry Group, whose efforts I also acknowledge, since it has been more than helpful to the local community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">We were getting up off our knees and heading in the right direction, but yesterday's news was very severe.  It is important that we not start playing the blame game or scoring political points.  All of us — public representatives, State agencies, the Department and the Minister — must work together to try to ensure that we can reverse this as completely as we reversed the previous situation in Kantoher.</p>

He has very kindly made himself available at my request to meet people in the coming days and I hope we can work together to try to replace those jobs.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_340">
            <from>Mr. Neville</from>
            <p eId="para_1057">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for providing the opportunity, which I requested yesterday, to raise this issue of vital importance to west Limerick, namely, the news that the processing plant, Castlemahon Food Products, is in liquidation and likely to close.  It is a major blow to the local population, especially to the 350 people employed at the plant and in allied work at Castlemahon.  They face a very bleak situation.  Many of them have been in the plant for decades and developed skills that must be recognised.  The plant should be saved in some way through working with the liquidator to ensure that those skills are utilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">The likelihood that Castlemahon will close compounds a situation which arose in January 2005 when 140 jobs were lost at  Kantoher Poultry Products, adjacent to the area, as well as 140 jobs at that time in Castlemahon.  Between direct and indirect employment there could be a loss of 1,000 jobs in that small region, where the poultry industry was so important since 1960 when Castlemahon moved into that area, having been established as a co-operative in 1920.  The factory has been a valuable employer and an integral part of the community in west Limerick, an area where there has been considerable deprivation.  Employees, their families and local suppliers are rocked by this news.  The economic cost to the area is enormous.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">It is especially devastating in an area of west Limerick where the population is in decline and where alternative job opportunities are severely limited.  Suppliers to the plant will be severely hit, too, and their situation must be immediately clarified.  In the case of Kantoher there was continuation of supply to the parent plant at Kerry.  We do not know what the situation is in the case of Castlemahon and it is quite serious.  In fact, this an area where there has been increased unemployment in recent times, as the figures show.  It is high time that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Agriculture and Food opened their eyes to the haemorrhaging of employment from regional rural communities such as this before we become a country of ghost towns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">The Government must immediately organise a committee of relevant services, high profile people and institutions to establish replacement industries and ensure the availability of employment for those being made redundant so that families have an opportunity to continue to live in the area, pay their mortgages and rear their children there.  A particular responsibility rests with the major party in Government, Fianna Fáil, to ensure that the 300 to 350 jobs are replaced immediately.  The loss of Castlemahon Food Products would eliminate sixfold the work done by many organisations and public-spirited people who campaigned over many years to have 50 jobs decentralised to Newcastle West.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">The Minister might say that the poultry industry in Ireland is a highly competitive one.  It is, for two reasons.  The first is the admittance of third country products from countries such as Thailand where increased production results in products being labelled as Irish.  There is no traceability.  The effect such cheap products will have on the poultry industry has been pointed out time and again, yet this situation has been accepted by the Government.  Poultry farmers have survived in Ireland and especially in this area by dint of hard work and strategic expansion where possible.  The industry as a whole, however, has suffered dramatically from increased costs.  The cost issue of the Castlemahon plant is something that has been raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">The industry must also meet excessively high standards imposed by Government while competing against the inferior products that in many cases are not even traceable.  The issue of the importation of Third World products is crucial in this competitive area and the Minister must take this on board.  Growers have invested substantially in their enterprises.  Many of them have heavy borrowings.  Many will see most of their livelihoods destroyed.  They will have to meet their borrowings regardless of what happens.  I took a call from a poultry producer today who simply asked me whether he would need planning permission to knock his poultry house, because that is all he can do with it.  When I checked it out, by the way, the answer was "No".</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">That is the sad situation such people find themselves in.  Since this Administration came to power, an industry that was crucial to the economy of that area of west Limerick, from Newcastle West to Castlemahon to Kantoher and up as far as Charleville, has disappeared.  That is a legacy which this Government has given to the poultry industry and its 1,000 employees in that area of west Limerick and up to 100 suppliers who will be made redundant, without the opportunity to negotiate redundancy packages.  I ask the Minister to get the Government to talk to the liquidator to ensure that what can be saved is saved.  The skills of the people there, built up over some 46 years, is the key to ensuring that the poultry industry continues in this area.  I thank the Minister for his time.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_341" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Mr. Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_1064">I thank the Deputies for raising these matters.  I appreciate Deputy Cregan's very constructive approach in his opening statement by trying to look for a way forward to see whether we can salvage something from yesterday's pessimistic announcement of the appointment of a liquidator and next month's High Court hearing in the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">I thank Deputy Neville for raising it, and appreciate his concerns, but people in general are far more sensible in terms of their appreciation of global forces, competition and the need to work on our existing industries to make them more competitive and to invest.  That depends on companies taking decisions as well.  Enterprise Ireland is available to assist companies on an ongoing basis to modernise, to change what they are doing and to move in terms of market needs.  It is still ready to be of assistance, if necessary, but Deputy Cregan made the point that there seems to be a degree of consolidation involved from west Limerick to other parts of the island, such as Armagh.  West Limerick has suffered as a result.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">Fundamentally, however, if job losses occur here, it affects the workers involved and their families, as Deputy Cregan and Deputy Neville have said, as well as the community in the surrounding areas.  It would be very distressing news for them and I want to assure the people concerned that the relevant State agencies will do everything they possibly can to provide support.  The priority in the event of closure will be to find alternative employment at the earliest opportunity for those involved.  The role of FÁS, the training agency, will be particularly important in assisting those who are to lose their jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">In February 2005, the company announced a restructuring plan which involved a reduction in staff numbers of 150, down from 410 to 260.  In May of that year, it confirmed that workers at the company had accepted its redundancy offer by a large majority and at that stage there was talk of further investment.  Unfortunately, matters have not improved over the past 18 months. In fact, they have continued to worsen.  The current level of profitability in the Irish poultry sector is very low.  This is due to a very fierce competitive market and increased volumes of cheaper imports from abroad.  Nevertheless, I understand the liquidator will be working closely with the management and other interests over the next few weeks in an effort to find new owners for the enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">Basically, the company has been operating in a very competitive market and has been trading at a loss for a number of years.  During this very difficult period, Enterprise Ireland has been in regular contact with the company.  Discussions were centred on potential involvement by the agency in the future development of the company.  However, despite the best efforts of all concerned, it was not possible to avoid the situation that has been reached.  Given its local presence in the area, Shannon Development has moved quickly to assist with efforts to minimise the effect of the closure on west Limerick and the Newcastle West area.  Within 24 hours of the public announcement, Shannon Development has arranged a meeting of West Limerick Resources Ltd., a local group in which Shannon Development is an active board member.  The group, chaired by Shannon Development and comprised of key local groups in the area has done much valuable work following the closure of Kantoher Poultry Products last year, with the loss of 138 jobs.  Together with representatives from Limerick County Enterprise Board and West Limerick Resources Ltd., the agency will meet all public representatives in the area to discuss how Shannon Development can support those affected by the closure.  Shannon Development will set up an internal working group to identify opportunities to assist those affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">As well as these initiatives, Shannon Development will stay in close contact with the Newcastle West Chamber of Commerce, which I recently met with Deputies Cregan and Collins.  The most recent live register figures, for August 2006, show a total of 6,327 for Limerick city and 1,006 for Newcastle West.  While the figure for Limerick city is down from 6,769 in the corresponding month in 2002, the figure for Newcastle West is up by 79.  However, overall figures for Limerick city and county show a decline in the live register from 8,593 in August 2002 to 8,253 in August 2006.  There is a churn in employment across the country.  Traditional industries are under pressure and are closing, while other industries, especially the service industry, are providing much employment.  In the past five or six years, more than 440,000 jobs were created in services and 150,000 in high-end manufacturing.  There has been a complete turn around in the nature of employment.  Much employment has moved to cities and towns.  We have asked the agencies to do what they can for indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">West Limerick in general is well serviced with industry with major companies such as Wyeth, Aughinish Alumina, Kostal, Ballygowan, and Pallas Foods being the major employers in the vicinity of Newcastle West.  In 2004, Shannon Development completed the land purchase and business plan for a new business park in Newcastle West.  The park is located on a 40-acre site adjoining the town, and infrastructural and servicing work on the first 20 acres is in place.  A BES unit, approved by Shannon Development, is now in place on the business park and clients are being sought.  Shannon Development has sold three sites to industrial companies and construction on these sites should commence by the end of this year.  In addition to these developments already under way, Shannon Development has solid inquiries on its books regarding site purchases for the business park.  These developments will help strengthen the industrial base of the Newcastle West area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">A central goal for the industrial development agencies is the achievement of balanced regional development.  The attractiveness of Limerick lies in its position as a regional gateway, with a critical mass and infrastructure necessary to attract mobile investment to the region.  The Government and the agencies recognise the need to provide high volume employment opportunities in Limerick that result in sustainable long-term jobs.  The strategies adopted have proved successful to date despite a competitive and ever-changing global economy.  It is disappointing to see job losses in the poultry sector, but Limerick has a strong base of foreign direct investment jobs.  The most recent figures available — for December 2005 — show that there are 38 overseas companies employing more than 8,500 people in permanent jobs and a further 1,500 in temporary and contract employment.  Most of these 10,000 jobs are in the city environs but as a result of the job losses in the company concerned, I am confident the State development agencies will strengthen their marketing and promotion efforts in the region and will make every effort to secure alternative employment for the area.  This will be done in partnership with other key players to maximise the flow of potential investors for the area and to convert these into investment and job opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">I assure the Deputies that we will do everything we can to assist the workers concerned by matching them with jobs created in the locality.  We will get the industrial agencies to move to attract the new industry and to create indigenous industry in the area.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
            <p eId="para_1074">I would like to extend my sincere sympathy to the family involved in this tragic case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">Community based social work services are generally provided on a Monday to Friday, 9.00am to 5.00pm basis.  There is currently no standardised national out-of-hours social work service.  However, individuals can access health services on a 24-hour basis through the General Practitioner Out-of-Hours service or through Accident and Emergency services.   Out-of-hours co-operatives are now in place in all HSE areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties.  It is estimated that over two million people are currently covered by out-of-hours co-operatives and that additional funding provided in 2006 should allow for up to 350,000 additional persons to be covered.  Services are also provided through Accident and Emergency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">In the tragic case referred to by the Deputy, I understand from the Health Service Executive that the receptionist at Ely Hospital did offer to contact Wexford General Hospital but the offer was declined.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">A HSE project team is currently assessing the feasibility of establishing an Out of Hours service and International Best Practice research was commissioned on centralised intake systems offering a seven day, 24 hour service to inform deliberations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">"Reach Out" — a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, 2005-2014, which was launched in September 2005, recommends a combined public health and high risk approach.  This approach to suicide prevention is also that advocated by the International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) and is in keeping with the European Action Plan for Mental Health.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">The National Office for Suicide Prevention was established by the Health Service Executive to oversee the implementation of "Reach Out".  An additional €1.2m has been allocated to the Office specifically for suicide prevention initiatives and research.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">Additional resources were made available in 2005 to put in place experienced psychiatric nursing staff in A &amp; E departments to respond to deliberate self harm presentations.  Further investment is being made in 2006 to ensure that, by year end, all A &amp; E departments have a service to respond to such presentations.  It is expected that most A&amp;E departments will be able to access a self harm specialist by the end of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">Each HSE area employs a Resource Officer for Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Promotion whose role is to co-ordinate and develop a broad response to suicide including the provision of training and counselling.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1083">I am aware of the report referred to in the question which calls for retrieval teams to be put in place to transfer critically ill patients between hospitals.  The current position here is as follows.  A Mobile Intensive Care Ambulance Service (MICAS) is in place to facilitate the transfer of critically ill adult patients for intensive care and other specialist health care services.  The service is operated jointly by a number of hospitals in Dublin and by the HSE Ambulance Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">A co-ordinating Consultant is designated for the week of service by a participating hospital.  This is usually the Intensive Care Consultant on duty.  The MICAS is staffed by an Intensive Care doctor (usually an Anaesthetist) and a staff nurse from the participating hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">Generally the MICAS operates during normal business hours but the service often extends beyond these hours.  Although the service caters predominately for adult patients, a small number of paediatric patients are catered for at the discretion of the duty co-ordinating consultant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">In addition to the MICAS, a Neo-Natal Transport Programme (NNTP) operates as a rapid response service for the stabilisation and transportation of premature and ill neonates up to six weeks of age.  It currently operates from 9am to 5pm seven days a week.  The service is operated by the three maternity hospitals in Dublin on a rotational basis in conjunction with the HSE Ambulance Service.  A designated neo-natal nurse and a neo-natal registrar are available daily.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">The HSE has advised my Department that proposals are being developed to extend the hours of operation of both services and to introduce a national MICAS retrieval service for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">In addition to the ground ambulance service, arrangements are in place with the Air Corps for the provision of emergency inter-hospital patient transport services.  A Service Level Agreement is in place between the Department of Defence, the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, the Defence Forces and the Air Corps.  It sets out the range of services to be provided by the Air Corps, specifically:</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1101">I propose to take Questions Nos. 118, 119, 143 and 210 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">This Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity in the health system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">In this context, I issued a policy direction to the Health Service Executive in July 2005 which is aimed at freeing up 1,000 additional beds for public patients.  This will be achieved through the development of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals and the transfer of private activity to those hospitals thereby freeing up capacity for public patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">The provision of up to 1,000 additional beds for public patients in this way will contribute to the achievement of the Government's commitment in the Health Strategy to increase acute hospital capacity by 3000 beds.  It will also have the following benefits:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1105">maximising the potential use of public hospital sites;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1106">promoting efficiency among public and private acute service providers;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1107">promoting greater competition in the supply of hospital services; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1108">offering improved quality and choice to all patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">The HSE recently advertised for expressions of interest for the construction and operation of private hospitals on the sites of ten publicly funded hospitals.  The project will be procured by utilising the new competitive dialogue tendering procedure.  The HSE received a large number of expressions of interest.  The HSE has pre-qualified a number (approx 6 bidders per hospital site) of successful candidates to progress to the next stage.  Invitations to participate in dialogue issued to the pre-qualified bidders in mid September 2006 with a deadline to submit outline proposals by late October.  The aim is to select up to three bidders in respect of each site who will be invited to tender to build and operate a private hospital on the site.  An operator may be a not-for-profit organisation or a for-profit organisation.  Both types are already providing services in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">Proposals will be subject to detailed evaluation by the HSE.  The procedure will also provide for a rigorous value for money assessment of any proposal and will take account of the value of the public site and the cost of any tax foregone.  Any transaction will be on a commercial basis and will fully protect the public interest.  In addition, there will be full adherence to public procurement law and best practice.</p>

          the number of cancelled operations in hospitals last year; her views on the fact that the majority of these operations are cancelled due to unavailability of beds; the steps that she intends to take to address this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1112">It is regrettable that some patients have their operations postponed and I recognise that this can cause upset and inconvenience for them and their families.  The Health Service Executive endeavours to keep postponements to a minimum and to have postponed operations rescheduled as soon as possible.  However due to the nature of the demands on the acute hospital system, in some instances, it is necessary to re-schedule planned treatment when priority has to be given to emergency cases or for a variety of other reasons such as infection control.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">The acute hospital services treated over 1 million patients as in-patients and daycases in 2005.  While information on the total number of postponed operations in 2005 is not immediately available from the HSE, I am advised that it represents a small percentage of overall activity.  For example, in the case of the nine main acute hospitals in the greater Dublin area, the number of in-patient and day case postponements represented less than 7% of the total number of elective admissions booked in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1114">This Government is committed to developing services in order to minimise the number of postponed operations through the provision of additional in-patient beds and day case places as well as maximising care and supports in the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">In 2001, the year of the publication of the Health Strategy, the average number of in-patient beds and day places available in the 53 public acute hospitals was 12,145.  At the end of 2005, this figure had increased by 1204 to a total of 13,349, involving an additional 724 in-patient beds and 480 day places.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">A further 450 acute beds/day places are in various stages of planning and development under the Health Service Executive's Capital Plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1117">I have already referred today to my initiative to have private hospitals built on the campuses of public hospitals.  This is designed to enable up to 1,000 beds in public hospitals, which are currently used by private patients, to be re-designated for use by public patients.  The HSE is currently engaged in a procurement process with the private sector to build and operate private hospitals on 10 public hospital sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118">All of these additional in-patient beds and day places will mean that this Government's commitment in the Health Strategy to increase total acute hospital capacity is well on the way to completion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1121">I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 761 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">The enforcement of food labelling legislation is included in the service contracts between the official agencies and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  The official agencies include the Health Service Executive, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">The Department of Health and Children is in touch with officials of the FSAI on an ongoing basis, and regular meetings are held to discuss a wide range of issues including labelling.  Any issues which arise in relation to the enforcement of food legislation, including enforcement and breaches of labelling legislation, are discussed where necessary, in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">I assume that the Deputy in his question is referring to the "Report of the Food Safety of Authority of Ireland Audit to determine compliance with Labelling and Traceability Requirements".  This was an internal report following a small scale audit undertaken by the FSAI in 2004, which drew attention to some deficiencies in traceability and labelling regimes.  In discussions with the Department, the FSAI has confirmed that the official agencies were provided with a report on the premises under their supervision which were visited as part of the audit.  Follow up action, by way of additional visits and inspections were undertaken, and I have been assured that the matters which required attention have now been rectified.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">While the bulk of control in relation to food labelling is carried out by staff in the official agencies as part of the routine official control programme, the Deputy may wish to note that the Authority has indicated that a series of checks will be conducted this year on various sectors of the food industry.  The results of these audits will be published and, where a deliberate intention to mislead the consumer is found, action will be taken against the food businesses concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_1130">The Strategy for Cancer Control published last June encompasses all aspects of cancer, including prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, supportive and palliative care.  My objective is to develop an integrated cancer control programme based on:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1131">evidence of what works to prevent and treat cancer</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1132">standards that assure quality in all aspects of cancer control and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1133">fairness, so that all patients, irrespective of county, region or personal financial means, can be assured of the best cancer care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">Our efforts to prevent cancer will include societal and public policy responses to reduce smoking and alcohol misuse and improve diet and exercise.  I have written to the Minister for Finance on fiscal measures to reduce the consumption of tobacco.  Heads of a Bill are being prepared for consideration by Government to regulate the use of sunbeds, including prohibiting their use by those under 16.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">I will shortly establish a National Cancer Screening Agency to amalgamate BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme (ICSP) to deliver both programmes nationally.  BreastCheck will commence national roll-out next year.  It is my goal to have the ICSP rolled out nationally by 2008, based on an affordable model.  The Agency will also advise in relation to a colorectal cancer screening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">The Health Service Executive is establishing a National Cancer Control Programme.  A Programme Director, at national level, will be accountable for all HSE cancer control activities.  A single national budget for all cancer control activities will be developed.  The Programme will facilitate national standards for equity and access and will maximise ambulatory care.  The HSE will establish four Managed Cancer Control Networks to deliver the Programme.  Clinical leaders in oncology will be appointed to lead the delivery of quality multi-disciplinary care nationally and at network level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">My Department is working closely with the HSE and the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) in implementing the national plan for the development of radiation oncology services agreed by Government in July 2005.  The NDFA has assembled a team to progress the financial and procurement aspects and the HSE has appointed a Project Manager and support team.   Two additional linear accelerators will be delivered at St. Luke's Hospital Dublin by Autumn of next year.  I have approved the HSE's proposals to construct interim facilities comprising of four linear accelerators and associated treatment planning at St. James's and Beaumont Hospitals.  The HSE expects to commence services by early 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">I have established a National Quality Assurance Group for Symptomatic Breast Disease to develop an agreed set of guidance for the interdisciplinary management of breast cancer.  My Department will, in consultation with the Interim Health Information and Quality Authority, further progress the Strategy recommendations on accreditation, quality guidelines, information and health technology assessment.  I intend to invest substantially in cancer control based on the reform programme I have outlined.</p>

            <p eId="para_1148">The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects data on MRSA bacteraemia (also known as bloodstream infection or "blood poisoning") as part of the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS).  EARSS collects data on the first episode of blood stream infection per patient per quarter.   The Irish data for EARSS, which is published on a quarterly basis by the HPSC, showed that there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 586 cases in 2005 and 127 reported cases in the 1st Quarter of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">It is difficult to identify the number of fatalities attributable to MRSA as many people also have significant co-morbidity factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">This year, Ireland is participating in the Hospital Infection Society's "Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections" in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The survey will provide accurate and comparable data on the prevalence of Health Care Associated Infections (including MRSA) in acute hospitals in Ireland.  The data gathered from hospitals can also be compared with similar data being obtained in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  The results will be available in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">The control of Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) including MRSA continues to be a priority for the HSE.  Measures to control the emergence and spread of HCAIs are necessary because there are fewer options available for the treatment of resistant infections and because these strains spread amongst vulnerable at-risk patients.  The prudent use of antibiotics underpins any approach to the control of antibiotic resistant bacteria, including MRSA.  This, together with good professional practice and routine infection control precautions, such as hand hygiene, constitute the major measures in controlling and preventing healthcare-associated infection, including that caused by MRSA, both in hospital and in community health care units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">The implementation of the revised SARI Guidelines on the control and prevention of MRSA in hospitals and in the community, the "Clean Hands Campaign", the National Hygiene Audits and the development of national standards in relation to infection control and hospital hygiene are also aimed at addressing the challenges presented by HCAIs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1154">The HSE has informed me that in November 2005, a sub-committee of the Executive's National Primary and Community Care Reform Working Group was established to review the current status of GP access to diagnostics; to explore current and potential capacity; and make short, medium and long-term recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">I am advised that work is being undertaken at present to progress two specific initiatives:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1156">The development of a service to facilitate the transportation of diagnostic specimens from GP surgeries to laboratories.</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1157">The key objective of this initiative is to increase the current national provision of such a service from 36% of the population to 60% in 2006.  Implementing this initiative requires the examination of both existing and development capacity of transportation and laboratory services, together with the development of joint protocols to encompass delivery of the service.  The HSE has indicated that this work is in progress.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1158">The development of a radiology/ ultrasound initiative.</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1159">The key objective of this initiative is to reduce waiting times for GP referrals nationally to a maximum of four weeks for plain film X-rays and eight weeks for ultrasound tests.  In order to meet this objective there are a number of complex factors to be considered relating to the capacity of the current services; the use of both public and private providers; infrastructure; hours of service and engagement arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">The HSE has established a Governance Group to oversee the implementation of these specific initiatives.  In addition, the Group will also be progressing other medium and longer-term recommendations in relation to referral guidelines; as well as developing diagnostic capacity at primary and community service level in order to reduce the reliance on the acute sector and to enhance clients' experiences of diagnostic services and their outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">Improving direct access for GPs to diagnostic services is also one of the actions in the Ten Point Plan to improve Accident and Emergency Services.  Arrangements have been put in place with private providers for the commissioning of Computerised Tomography scans and Magnetic Resonance Imaging to facilitate direct access for GPs.  To date, more than 1,500 CT scans and 100 MRI scans have been carried out under this initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_1175">Community based mental health services receive referrals from their colleagues in primary care and provide assessment and treatment to individuals with eating disorders.  Outpatient psychiatric services are provided from a network of hospitals, health centres, day hospitals and day centres.  However, where the individual's psychiatric or medical needs are more acute, in-patient admission is offered within the local psychiatric services or acute medical care where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1176">St Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin provides a referral service for public patients with eating disorders and has three dedicated national public beds for the assessment of such patients.  There is currently a waiting list of 18 months for these in-patient beds.  Some HSE areas have placed public patients with eating disorders in St Patrick's Hospital and St John of God's private facilities when required.  In a limited number of cases, consultants make referrals to specialised eating disorder private services in Dublin or the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">"A Vision for Change" acknowledges gaps in the current provision of mental health services for persons with eating disorders and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services.  Recommendations include support for health promotion initiatives that encourage greater community and family awareness of eating disorders, the further development of primary and community care services and the provision of a full multidisciplinary team in a National Centre for Eating Disorders.  It recommended that this National Centre be located in one of the national children's hospitals to deal with complex cases that cannot be managed by local child and adolescent community mental health teams.  The Government has accepted the Expert Group's report as the basis for the future development of the mental health services in the next seven to ten years.  An additional €25 million was made available this year to the HSE for the further development of our mental health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">The HSE has established an implementation group to plan and manage the full implementation of "A Vision for Change".  An independent monitoring group has also been established to monitor progress in implementing the report's recommendations and report to me on an annual basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1200">When Ms Anne Dunne SC presented her report and appendices on post mortem practice to me in March 2005, I was advised by the Attorney General that the full report was unpublishable for legal and natural justice reasons.  Some sections of the report were released on 18 July last in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Acts from Parents for Justice.  However, in the light of the legal advice available to me, I have no plans to publish the full report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">Dr.Deirdre Madden, a distinguished expert on medical law, was appointed by Government in May 2005 to provide me with a report on key issues relating to post mortem practice and procedures.  Dr. Madden had access to all of the documentation assembled by the previous Inquiry chaired by Ms Dunne.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">Dr. Madden's report on Post Mortem Practice and Procedures was published on 18 January this year.  It contains 50 recommendations which my Department in conjunction with the HSE and other relevant agencies are in the process of implementing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">The HSE has set up a committee to oversee implementation of recommendations relevant to its responsibilities.  Work in progress includes:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1204">conducting an independent audit of retained organs in hospitals</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1205">the development of national protocols and guidelines</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1206">the standardisation of practice</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1207">content of a national information and awareness campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">A key recommendation of Dr. Madden's report was that a Working Group be established to examine issues not included in her original terms of reference, that is post mortem issues relating to babies who died before or during birth, minors and adults.  This Group, again chaired by Dr Madden, was set up in March, 2006 and its membership includes representatives of Parents For Justice.  It will report in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">In relation to legislation, Regulations were put in place in April to transpose Directive 2004/23/EC on quality and safety of tissues and cells, which include the requirement for consent prior to retention of tissues and cells.  An examination of what other Irish tissue legislation is needed is underway, with a view to progressing this legislation as a priority in 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_1216">I propose to take Questions Nos. 135, 149, 185 and 759 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">It is regrettable that some patients have their operations postponed and I recognise that this can cause upset and inconvenience for them and their families.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) endeavours to keep postponements to a minimum and to have postponed operations rescheduled as soon as possible.  However due to the nature of the demands on the acute hospital system, in some instances, it is necessary to re-schedule planned treatment when priority has to be given to emergency cases or for a variety of other reasons such as infection control.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">The acute hospital services treated over 1 million patients as in-patients and daycases in 2005.  The number of postponed operations is a small percentage of the overall activity of  acute hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">Detailed information on the total number of postponed operations in 2005 is not immediately available from the HSE.  I have asked that it should be collated and provided to the Deputies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">This Government is committed to developing services in order to minimise the number of postponed operations through the provision of additional in-patient beds and day case places as well as maximising care and supports in the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">In 2001, the year of the publication of the Health Strategy, the average number of in-patient beds and day places available in the 53 public acute hospitals was 12,145.  At the end of 2005, this figure had increased by 1204 to a total of 13,349, involving an additional 724 in-patient beds and 480 day places.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">A further 450 acute beds/day places are in various stages of planning and development under the Health Service Executive's Capital Plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">I have already referred today to my initiative to have private hospitals built on the campuses of public hospitals.  This is designed to enable up to 1,000 beds in public hospitals, which are currently used by private patients, to be re-designated for use by public patients.  The HSE is currently engaged in a procurement process with the private sector to build and operate  private hospitals on 10 public hospital sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">All of these additional  in-patient beds and day places will mean that this Government's commitment in the Health Strategy to increase total acute hospital capacity is well on the way to completion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1233">During the period January 1st to September 25th 2006, a total of 48 new consultants were appointed to permanent posts in the public health service.  These posts are in a range of specialties, including medicine, surgery, anaesthesia, pathology, psychiatry, radiology and obstetrics &amp; gynaecology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">During the same period, a total of 102 consultant posts have been approved by the HSE, comprising 64 additional (new) posts and 38 replacement posts.  The total consultant establishment in the public sector in Ireland is 2,083.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">Following sanction by the HSE, the filling of consultant posts is undertaken by employing authorities.  These include the HSE, the publicly funded voluntary hospitals and voluntary agencies.  The recruitment process can take about a year.  This is due to a number of factors, such as the advertising process, which can often involve international advertisements, the establishment of appropriate interview panels, the number of candidates returning from overseas to occupy these posts and the need for candidates to give up to six months' notice to their current employers in order to avoid a service deficiency in their current roles.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">Figures relating to 2005 help to illustrate this; in 2005 a total of 128 consultant posts were approved, of which 36 were filled in 2005.  However, a total of 143 consultants took up duty as permanent consultants in 2005, many to posts which would have been approved prior to 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">In relation to 2007, the HSE has supplied a comprehensive Estimates 2007 document to my Department, which includes submissions seeking additional consultant posts in a range of areas which reflect the growth in demand for services and the continued need to move towards a consultant provided service.  As part of the Estimates process, my Department will be engaging with the HSE in relation to funding additional consultant posts in 2007.</p>

That committee deals with pay related awards for all relevant senior managers in the HSE.  My approval is not required for individual awards under the scheme.  The overall operation of the scheme will be monitored by the Committee for Performance Rewards in the Health Sector in line with the arrangements for non-commercial bodies generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">To receive performance related awards executives should fulfil demanding and measurable targets that are based on stretched performance by fully competent persons.  The targets should go beyond what is seen as the normal on-going requirements of the job and they should be difficult but not impossible to attain.  In circumstances where executives reach such targets, I think it is reasonable that they would qualify for bonuses as provided for in their remuneration arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1251">Following the death of Mr. Patrick J. Walsh in Monaghan Hospital on 14 October 2005 the Health Service Executive commissioned Mr. Declan Carey, a consultant surgeon at Belfast City Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Queen's University, and Professor John Monson, Professor of Surgery University of Hull, to carry out an independent and external review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">The HSE published the Report of the Independent Inquiry on 7 September.  The Report details the difficulties that arose in trying to secure Mr. Walsh's transfer from Monaghan to either Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda or Cavan General Hospital.  It also exposes a failure in communications between clinicians and hospitals in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">Since the death of Mr. Walsh, a new  protocol in relation to patient transfer has been put in place.  It provides that all requests for transfer from Monaghan General Hospital to Cavan General Hospital or Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda should be granted and processed immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">The HSE has recently established a Steering Group and a North East Project Group to oversee a programme to improve safety and standards across the acute hospital network in the North East Region having regard to the issues raised in this Report and the Report prepared for the HSE by Teamwork Management Services on Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards — An Action Plan for Health Services in the North East.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">The Teamwork Report makes a number of short, medium and long-term recommendations.  It concludes that the present system, where five local hospitals deliver acute care to relatively small populations, is exposing patients to increased risks and creating additional professional risks for staff.  The Report highlights the need to develop a high quality and responsive emergency and planned service, in line with international standards, by developing local services within existing hospitals and other local centres supported by a new Regional Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">Led by the HSE's National Hospitals Office, the Steering Group has representation from key stakeholders such as clinicians and primary care providers.  The Project Group is being led by a Consultant Surgeon from outside the Region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">The HSE has given me an assurance that, in progressing the implementation of these reports, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_1259">The Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006 (No. 3 of 2006) contains an enabling provision for the extension of prescriptive authority to nurses and midwives (Section 16 (l) (ii)).

            <p eId="para_1260">My Department launched a public consultation process on the extension of prescriptive authority to nurses and midwives in May this year.  Respondents were given a six week time frame to return submissions.  I am pleased to say that a large number of submissions, some 122, were received in reply to my Department's public request for same.  Officials of my Department are currently finalising the Review of Submissions, the findings of which will inform the drafting of the Statutory Instrument (S.I.) drawing up regulations to introduce nurse/midwife prescribing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">It is anticipated that the drafting of the S.I. for the Regulations on nurse/midwife prescribing will take some weeks.  Furthermore, in accordance with Directive 98/34/EC (as amended by Directive 98/48/EC) any draft regulations which will effect the Internal Market must be notified to the EU.  Accordingly, the Draft S.I. on nurse/midwife prescribing must be circulated to each Member State who are given a three month time frame to consider same.  However, I am confident that the Regulations to enable nurse/midwife prescribing will be in place early next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">It must be noted that before any nurse/midwife may prescribe, she/he must undertake a specific educational package for nurse/midwife prescribers.  Discussions are currently underway with the relevant stakeholders to ensure that the requisite education programme will be put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_1266">The Taoiseach, Professor Brendan Drumm and I met with representatives of the Adelaide Hospital Society on 28 June 2006 to discuss a number of issues relating to the Adelaide and Meath Hospital incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght.  The delegation included the Most Rev R.H.A. Eames, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, the Very Rev Dr David Clarke, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland and Rev Desmond Bain, former President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, together with the Archbishop of Dublin, The Most Rev Dr John W Neill, President of the Hospital.  They expressed concern at the implications for the National Children's Hospital of the recent Government decision to endorse the development of a single national tertiary paediatric hospital on a site to be made available at the Mater Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">A number of other matters relating to the provision of hospital services at Tallaght were also discussed.  In this context the delegation submitted a document proposing a wide range of service developments at the hospital over the next 10 years.  The proposals, which have significant resource implications, have been forwarded to the Health Service Executive for consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">In a letter to Archbishop Eames following the meeting, the Taoiseach gave an assurance that the Government wishes the hospital to thrive on a sustainable basis as a particular focal point for the involvement of the minority tradition in the healthcare system and as a key health provider to an expanding local population.  These objectives will be pursued in tandem with other compelling objectives, including the achievement of an effective and efficient hospital care system, which will deliver the highest possible standards of care within a framework designed to respond to the needs of patients at national, regional and local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">Arising from the meeting, it has also been decided that a review will be conducted of decisions taken with regard to the funding and development of the hospital.  The arrangements for the review are being finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1276">There is no legislation in Ireland governing the intervention in the natural process of creating human life; instead, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council.

            <p eId="para_1277">The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction was established in March 2000.  Its terms of reference were:</p>

The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories and treatment services must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1321">devise a strategy for reducing the average working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) so as to achieve the requirements of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD);</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1324">and consider the requirements for medical education and training arising from any changes to the current model of delivering services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">The Report of the Task Force (generally known as the Hanly Report) made a series of important recommendations.  These covered issues such as:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1326">the changes needed in NCHD work patterns;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1327">the need for a significant increase in the number of consultants;</p>

            <p eId="para_1331">Work is proceeding in relation to each of the main recommendations made by the Task Force.  The most difficult recommendations to implement, and the ones that have proved most controversial,  are those relating to the reorganisation of acute hospital services.  The Task Force advised that the current organisation, structure and staffing of our hospital system is failing to deliver the care that, at its best, the Irish system is capable of giving.  It further advised that patients have better outcomes when treated in hospitals with appropriate numbers of specialist staff, high volumes of activity and access to the right diagnostic and treatment facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">I am concerned that, at present, some patients are being exposed to increased risk because specialist services are being provided in some hospitals that lack the necessary critical mass of activity and patient throughput.  Patient safety and quality must be paramount and must be the key drivers in the re-configuration of our acute hospital services and, indeed, our services generally.  The policy of the Government is to provide safe, high-quality services that achieve the best possible outcomes for patients.  This will mean rebalancing service delivery so that those services that can be safely delivered locally are delivered locally and that more complex services that require specialist input are concentrated at regional centres, or in the case of highly specialised services such as organ transplantation, in national centres of excellence.  This approach is consistent with international best practice for the optimum delivery of patient care.  The Health Service Executive has begun the process of reorganising our acute services in order to achieve these objectives.  This will take time and, in the meantime, there will be no diminution in services available locally until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_1343">GPs who hold General Medical Services Scheme contracts for service with the Health Service Executive (HSE) are self-employed practitioners who undertake to provide general practitioner services for their assigned patients for a total of 40 hours, to cover surgery and domiciliary visits, on 5 or more days per week, as agreed with the Executive.  They are also obliged to put in place arrangements that enable contact to be made with them or a deputy/locum for emergencies outside of these times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">The Primary Care Strategy provides for the delivery of comprehensive, multidisciplinary services in the primary care setting with health professionals co-located where appropriate.

            <p eId="para_1345">Between 2000 and 2005 approximately €105 million was allocated to the health boards (now the HSE) for Out of Hours GP co-operative service development.  In 2006 almost €34 million is available to the HSE for this area.  GP Out of Hours services are now available in all HSE areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties.  GPs who participate in out of hours co-operatives have a driver provided for any Out of Hours house calls and the treatment centres have other support staff that may include security if local management feel it is appropriate.</p>

A critical element in this process is the establishment of the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA).  The draft standards have been forwarded to the interim Health Information and Quality Authority for its consideration.  It is envisaged that the legislation to establish the Health Information and Quality Authority on a statutory basis will be brought forward in the current term.

            <p eId="para_1353">Information supplied to my Department by the Health Service Executive (HSE) indicates that as at 1st September 2006 there were 29,175 persons holding a GP visit card.</p>
            <p eId="para_1354">Legislation to enable the introduction of GP visit cards was enacted in March 2005.  Negotiations took place under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission with the Irish Medical Organisation in order to facilitate the introduction of the cards and an agreement was successfully reached in September, 2005.  Thus the GP visit card has been available for less than a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1355">The GP visit card initiative was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1356">Significant changes were made in 2005 to make it easier for people to qualify for a medical card or a GP visit card.  The income guidelines used to assess eligibility for the medical and GP visit card were increased by a cumulative 29%.  A higher rate of increase was applied to the income allowances for children and was specifically aimed at assisting low income families.  Also, the assessment of means is now based on income after tax and PRSI and full account is taken of reasonable expenses in respect of rent/mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work which has the effect of  further reducing the threshold at which a person would qualify for the medical card or the GP visit card.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">In June 2006 I agreed with the HSE a further adjustment to the income assessment guidelines used for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those used for medical cards.  Since the introduction of the GP Visit Card, the HSE has conducted two national media advertising campaigns to promote the benefit.  Since July of this year the HSE has made available on its website <i>‘www.hse.ie’</i> a calculator which will help people to get an indication as to whether they might qualify. The HSE continues to publicise all of these change to encourage people to apply and has made the application process as simple as possible.  The HSE has informed me that, in addition, a specific programme of work is being undertaken, focused on further modernisation of the administrative and operational arrangements regarding the GP visit card and related primary care schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1358">An example of the effect of these changes at the minimum qualifying threshold measure is that a married couple or a single parent with two children are allowed to earn €514 per week after tax and PRSI and qualify for a GP visit card.  If these persons have rent/mortgage, childcare or travel to work expenses, then their allowed earnings would increase in accordance  with these outgoings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">I believe that the substantial increases which have been made to the income guidelines in respect of both the medical card and GP visit card, allied with the HSE's campaign to encourage people to apply, ensures that the most vulnerable people in our society have free access to GP services.  I have provided the funding to the HSE for 200,000 GP visit cards and I encourage people who have any difficulties in meeting their GP costs to apply for this benefit.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1366">I propose to take Questions Nos. 165, 178 and 792 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">Adoptions from Vietnam are carried out under the terms of a bi-lateral adoption agreement between Ireland and Vietnam which both Governments ratified in early 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">Almost 150 adoptions have been effected under this agreement and the Adoption Board has received written notification from the Ministry of Justice in Vietnam confirming (i) the legality of adoptions that have been effected under the Irish–Vietnamese Bi-Lateral Adoption Agreement, and (ii) that these adoptions were processed in accordance with Vietnamese legal requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1369">The agreement requires that all adoptions from Vietnam be organised by an Irish agency (known as a Mediation Agency) registered by the Irish Adoption Board to operate in Vietnam under licence from the Vietnamese government.  The establishment of such a Mediation Agency is also a requirement of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_1370">In May 2005, pending the establishment of such a Mediation Agency, the Vietnamese Authorities proposed that a single facilitator fulfil this role for a twelve month period.  This arrangement was to enable adoptions to begin in the face of the humanitarian crisis in Vietnamese orphanages following the closure of Vietnam for Intercountry adoption in 2002 – UNICEF estimate that there are 2.1 million orphans in Vietnam.  The Vietnamese Authorities emphasised the importance of Irish applicants working solely with the facilitator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1371">The Adoption Board has now registered an Irish Mediation Agency as the permanent arrangement to facilitate adoptions in conformity with the bi-lateral Adoption Agreement thus replacing the temporary facilitator.  Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency is now operational following receipt of its Vietnamese licence to operate on behalf of prospective Irish adopters on 26th April 2006 and has opened offices in Vietnam.  The Vietnamese authorities have recently confirmed in writing that the Helping Hands Mediation Agency is now fully operational and meeting all of its obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1372">With regard to the person referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied to the PQ the police check initially carried out by Interpol, Washington, in 2004, prior to the appointment of Ms Soland, and based on her name and birth, did not show Ms Soland listed in the files of Interpol and confirmed that "the subject is not criminally recorded in the files of the Maryland and Virginia police authorities".</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">The later check carried out in June, 2006 by Interpol, Washington, and based on the anonymous allegations received by the Board does confirm that Ms Soland was arrested and charged in 1995 with Conspiracy to defraud the United States and Obstruction of Justice/Witness Intimidation.  The correction action is set down as Status – Supervised Release under the United States Probation Agency, Virginia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">Ms Soland was requested to abstain from any involvement in facilitating adoptions as soon as the anonymous allegations were received.  She, thereafter, officially resigned from her position on 28th June 2006 and agreed to transfer the remaining Vietnamese adoption dossiers and all fees paid over in respect of those adoption applications to the Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency in Vietnam.  The transfer process is now well in hand.  It should also be noted that she had no responsibility or role in the legal processes relating to adoptions from Vietnam under the Agreement and at no time during her period as facilitator was any evidence produced that she did other than comply with the adoption laws of Vietnam.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">The payment of fees in relation to adoptions effected in accordance with the bi-lateral agreement, and the mechanisms by which they are paid, is a matter for the sovereign Government of Vietnam.  The fees, and their breakdown, are clearly set out in full for prospective adoptive parents so that they are fully aware of all the facts before making an application to the Vietnamese authorities.  All fees are now processed through Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">The humanitarian element, which constitutes over 75% of the fee, has enabled a school for children to be opened and funds a range of humanitarian projects, which are carried out under a legal contract agreed between the Mediation Agency and the local provincial governments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1383">Negotiations recommenced on the 26th January 2006 between the HSE-Employers Agency/ Departments of Health and Children and Finance and the IHCA and IMO on a new contract of employment for Hospital Consultants.  A paper outlining the employer's proposals for a new dedicated Public Hospital Consultants contract was presented to the medical organisations at this meeting but they refused to discuss it at this juncture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">The negotiations have stalled following a further meeting on the 9th February 2006 primarily because of a disagreement between the parties on the ‘pricing' of a new contract and also the insistence of the IHCA and the IMO that the position that pertained prior to 13th January 2006 regarding the arrangements for structuring Category II Consultant posts should remain unchanged until the completion of contract negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">A fresh attempt by the independent Chairman, Mr. Mark Connaughton, S.C., to get the talks restarted again on Thursday 29 June failed when the IHCA/IMO refused to re-enter negotiations on a new Consultant Common Contract, unless their pre-condition was accepted, ie. that the pre-13th January 2006 position was reinstated.

            <p eId="para_1388">The number of voluntary notifications made by Childminders to the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) since the announcement of the proposed introduction of the Childcare Relief in December 2005, has been monitored by my Office on a regular basis.  In April 2006 I provided the Deputy with the latest figures available at that time.  I am pleased to be able to respond to the Deputy's latest request on this matter by providing the most recent information, as at 1 September, 2006, presented by the CCCs to my Office, which is summarised in the table below.  I have asked that the arrangements in place for the collection of these figures include monitoring the number of new voluntary notifications on a quarterly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">As the Deputy will see, while the initial data collection included the number of enquiries received by CCCs in relation to the initiative, the more recent data deals only with the number of voluntary notifications made.  While I am pleased to note that the latest figures show a substantial increase since April in the number of voluntary notifications made this year, I would also point out that as the first tax year for which the Relief applies is 2006, and the relevant date for tax returns is the end of October 2007, it is clearly not possible at this stage to estimate what will be the final take-up of the initiative in its first year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">I would also like to inform the Deputy that, to further support the CCCs and Childminders, I hope to be in a position shortly to launch a set of National Guidelines for Childminders which have been developed by the National Childcare Coordinating Committee in conjunction with my Office.  The Guidelines will provide a useful resource to the CCCs and to Childminders and are expected to support the further harmonisation and take up of the voluntary notification system.</p>

The QAP initiative is delivered at local level by the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) and was widely publicised by them at the time of its introduction.  The CCCs were established under the EOCP to assist in the development of a quality childcare infrastructure at local level.  The intention of the QAP initiative was to raise quality awareness among existing and prospective Childminders through a Quality Awareness Lecture Programme and to encourage Childminders outside the scope of the Child Care (Pre-School Service) Regulations to notify their service to their local CCC or Childminder Advisory Officer.  Childminders who voluntarily notify their service under the initiative, or who are notified to the HSE in accordance with the Child Care Regulations, may apply for the Childminder Development Grant.  The grant is a small developmental grant of up to 90% of the total cost, subject to a maximum grant of €630, which can be used to buy safety equipment, toys or to make minor adjustments to the Childminder's home to enhance or establish the childminding service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">As the Deputy suggests, the numbers seeking the grant have been less than anticipated.  While €1.89 million (i.e. funding for 3,000 grants) was made available for the grant scheme, at June 2006 the number of grants approved was 937.  However in general terms, it is considered that the initiative, which also supports training, networking and the information needs of Childminders, has been very successful in terms of its contribution to building quality awareness among Childminders.  This is reflected in the fact that 3,422 Childminders have attended the Quality Awareness Lecture Programme provided by the CCCs during this period.  It is considered that the successful uptake of this strand of the QAP indicates that the initiative, which is promoted among Childminders at local level by the CCCs, is known to the Childminding sector but that their preference to date has been to avail of the Programme elements rather than the grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">The National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006-2010 which has been introduced as a successor programme to the EOCP will continue to support Childminders as well as helping to deliver quality childcare facilities and other supports to the sector generally.  A review of the Childminder Initiative is expected to be undertaken in due course under the NCIP and any new development arising from such a review will be publicised and promoted by my Office and by the CCCs at local level to maximise interest and uptake.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">In addition, the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010 which was announced in the context of Budget 2006 includes the introduction of the Childminders Relief from income tax where the income from childminding does not exceed €10,000 per annum.  To avail of the Relief, Childminders who are outside the scope of the Child Care Regulations are required to notify their services to their local CCC or Childminder Advisory Officer.  This will further support the voluntary notification system operated by the CCCs as part of their work to support Childminders.  I understand that since the Budget announcement in December 2005, some 318 voluntary notifications have been recorded by the CCCs and this figure is expected to increase further between now and the end of October 2007 when the first tax return in which the Relief may be claimed is due.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">In addition, a set of National Guidelines for Childminders, prepared by the National Childcare Coordinating Committee, is expected to be published in the coming months by my Office and will provide an important resource to Childminders and to the CCCs in promoting good practice and increasing the voluntary notification of services.  This in turn would be expected to stimulate further interest in the QAP and will help to inform any review which is undertaken.</p>

            <p eId="para_1476">In 2001, the year of the publication of Health Strategy, the average number of in-patient beds and day places available for treatment of patients in the 53 public acute hospitals was 12,145.

            <p eId="para_1478">In July 2005, I announced an initiative to have private hospitals built on the campuses of public hospitals.

The HSE is currently engaged in a procurement process with the private sector to build and operate private hospitals on 10 public hospital sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">All of these additional in-patient beds/day places will mean that this Government's commitment in the Health Strategy to increase total acute hospital capacity is well on the way to completion.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
            <p eId="para_1483">There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements are made to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.  My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service.  This process has been underway for some time and considerable progress has been made in talks on a settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_1487">The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including services for older people, were considered in the context of the work of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy.  The Group's report entitled "A Vision for Change" was published on Tuesday 24th January, 2006.  The Government has accepted the Expert Group's report as the basis for the future development of the mental health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">The Expert Group considered the mental health needs of people in later life and made recommendations in relation to the development of a comprehensive range of services appropriate to their needs.  It acknowledges that all users of mental health services are entitled to a range of services and that access to delivery of those services is crucial in the case of older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">The implementation of the recommendations is primarily a matter for the HSE and they established an implementation group to plan and manage the full implementation of "A Vision for Change".  An independent monitoring group has also been established to monitor progress in implementing the report's recommendations and to report on an annual basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490">As the Deputy may be aware, the report of the Working Group on Elder Abuse, ‘Protecting Our Future', was published in 2002.

            <p eId="para_1491">The Government is fully committed to developing the services needed to tackle elder abuse and in the period 2003-2005 provided additional funding of approximately €2.5 million towards the implementation of the Elder Abuse Programme.  In Budget 2006 additional funding of €2m was allocated towards the elder abuse programme, which completes the funding requirements outlined in the Report, including the establishment of a National Research Centre.</p>

            <p eId="para_1493">A number of the recommendations contained in the Interim Report of the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol concern a reduction in the exposure of children and adolescents to alcohol advertising, marketing and sponsorship.  In response to these, my Department entered into negotiations with the broadcasting, media and drinks industries while at the same time pursuing the development of legislation to restrict alcohol advertising, sponsorship and sales promotions/marketing practices.  It was agreed that the industry would respond on an incremental basis.  This has resulted in the establishment of Central Copy Clearance Ireland which addresses the issue of the content of advertisements, the development of a Voluntary Code of Practice on Advertising which addresses the issue of placement and the establishment of the Alcohol Marketing and Communications Monitoring Body to oversee the implementation of the Voluntary Code.  As the Minister for Health and Children has previously indicated, she will await the Annual Report of the Monitoring Body before deciding on future actions in relation to legislation on this issue.  Negotiations with the industry stakeholders are ongoing and will include the issue of sponsorship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">The Health Promotion Policy Unit of my Department has also engaged directly with national sporting organisations.

            <p eId="para_1556">It is recognised that involuntary admissions can often be a traumatic experience for the service user and their families and carers.  The development of community based mental health services, as advocated in A Vision for Change, provides alternatives to involuntary admissions.  The Mental Health Act 2001, which will come into full effect on 1st November, 2006 also introduces new protections for the involuntary patient and emphasises the right of the patient to information.  The absence of information during the involuntary admission process was one of the issues highlighted by the service users in the study.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanPower" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_403">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_1560">The Deputy may be aware that the development of services for people of all ages with Alzheimer's Disease is based on the Action Plan for Dementia published by the National Council on Ageing and Older People in 1999.  The Plan outlines the complexity and range of issues involved in the effective management of dementia and emphasises the need for the development of co-ordinated, multi-layered and well-resourced services, which are responsive to the individual needs of people with dementia and those who care for them.  A number of recommendations are outlined the Plan including; an increase in funding, changes to service delivery mechanisms, expansion of Old Age Psychiatry services, increased supports for family carers and the provision of day care and respite services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">Considerable progress has been made in service development since the publication of the report and, in each of the years 1999 to 2005, the Department and the HSE provided additional funding to Psychiatry of Old Age (over €5 million) and to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland (over €2 million) for services delivered.  The Health Service Executive is also making progress in the provision of stand-alone Dementia Units on a gradual basis.  Since the report was published supports have also been enhanced in relation to community nursing, paramedical services and home help services.  In terms of dementia specific services, new day care centres and residential units have been designed and developed in partnership with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  Home care services have also been specifically developed to meet the needs of persons with Alzheimer's and their carers.  All of the above provisions apply to all Dementia sufferers, regardless of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">There is a complementary link between Government policy in the area of the care of older people and in care for people with dementia.  Both policies stress the need to provide support in dignity and independence, through the provision of appropriate services to the people concerned and their carers.  The Government is fully committed to providing such support and service improvement, including the expansion of community and residential care services for people with Dementia.  This commitment was reflected in the additional funding of €150 million allocated in the 2006 Budget towards improving services for older people and palliative care.  Approximately two thirds of this money is allocated to community support for older people.  This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">The additional funding provided for Home Care Packages and the Home Help Scheme will further enhance the supports available to families caring for people with dementia at home.  The Health Service Executive works closely with the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland and this has resulted in greater awareness of the needs of people with dementia and the development of a wide range of supports.</p>

The HSE has advised the two Departments of its view that the school of podiatry would be best located in a large centre of population, one that is associated with a multidisciplinary health professional environment and which is linked to a major teaching hospital.  My Department is in continuing discussions with the Department of Education and Science and the HSE to progress this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1569">In relation to the two other matters raised in the Deputy's question, I would refer him to my response to question number 21331/06 of 1 June 2006.  First, the concerns raised by the Medical Council in relation to audit are under consideration in my Department in the context of clinical governance and the role of the Health Information and Quality Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">Second, I am informed by the Medical Council that if a doctor whose name is on the General Register of the Medical Council in Ireland is struck off for misconduct in another jurisdiction, the Medical Council can only impose a sanction following the holding of its own fitness to practise inquiry.  This situation is underpinned by the Supreme Court in a judgment from 2004, which reaffirmed the constitutional rights of an accused doctor to a fair hearing.  The effect of this judgment is that individual complainants must give evidence and this evidence may be cross-examined.  The individual who makes the complaint must be willing to give evidence to that inquiry and, if living overseas, cannot be compelled to do so.  The Medical Council informs me that it has accommodated overseas witnesses by use of video-link thus avoiding the need to travel.  The Medical Council states that it cannot simply rely on the findings and transcripts of medical regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">I am informed by the Council that if a doctor is struck off for misconduct in another jurisdiction and then applies for registration in Ireland, the application can be refused.</p>

Accordingly, my Department has requested the Chief Officers of the HSE areas to investigate the matter raised and to reply directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1586">I propose to take Questions Nos. 194, 205, 808, 812 and 813 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">Tackling the problems in A &amp; E departments is the Government's top priority in health.  Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A &amp; E and do not require admission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">A &amp; E services are improving around the country.  Compared to this time last year, the average number of patients in A &amp; E departments awaiting admission is down by approximately 50%.  The average time that patients spend waiting for admission has also been reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">The HSE established a dedicated Task Force to work with hospitals to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of services in A &amp; E departments.  Teams from the Task Force undertook site visits to each of the hospitals identified as experiencing consistent difficulties in A &amp; E services, to discuss individual issues and potential high-impact solutions.  The Task Force's conclusions and recommendations will inform the HSE's actions in relation to A &amp; E over the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">A &amp; E departments are not stand-alone services; they are a critical part of a complex healthcare system.  Their ability to function efficiently and effectively is heavily dependent on well-functioning practices and processes within the entire acute hospital system, and the availability of integrated primary and community services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">In order that A &amp; E targets and objectives can be achieved over the clinical winter months, the HSE is introducing a broad-based Winter Initiative to build on its existing range of initiatives.  The Winter Initiative will be similar to those in place in other health systems internationally.  Its purpose is to ensure that the services required to address the particular demands of the winter season are in place and operating optimally.  It will focus on a range of measures, including preventative measures, public communications, discharge initiatives, continuing care and home supports.  Tackling the issue of care for older people is an important and integral part of the Initiative.  The HSE is implementing a number of measures aimed at achieving increases in extended care provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">I do not accept that the difficulties experienced in managing A &amp; E services relate to inadequate staffing levels.  There have been significant increases in staffing levels in A &amp; E departments in recent years and the resources available compare favourably with services internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1593">I believe that the actions and initiatives being taken by the HSE will result in the sustained improvements in A &amp; E services that patients and their families deserve.  However, as the Deputy was previously advised, the delivery of clinical training, which is a significant core component of the course, has been the subject of discussions between officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Science in terms of how best it could be facilitated in an integrated fashion with the Health Service Executive (HSE) services.</p>

         her views on a recent study commissioned by the Alzheimer Society which found that services for people with dementia are fragmented, unsuitable and poorly resourced and that there is lack of information about the services available and the difficulty in navigating a complex health and social care system in which services are often unresponsive to the real needs of people with dementia and their carers; the steps she intends to take to improve this situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_1606">The Deputy may be aware that the development of services for people of all ages with Alzheimer's Disease is based on the Action Plan for Dementia published by the National Council on Ageing and Older People in 1999.  The Plan outlines the complexity and range of issues involved in the effective management of dementia and emphasises the need for the development of co-ordinated, multi-layered and well-resourced services, which are responsive to the individual needs of people with dementia and those who care for them.  A number of recommendations are outlined in the Plan including; an increase in funding, changes to service delivery mechanisms, expansion of Old Age Psychiatry services, increased supports for family carers and the provision of day care and respite services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">Considerable progress has been made in service development since the publication of the report and, in each of the years 1999-2005, the Department and the HSE provided additional funding to Psychiatry of Old Age (over €5 million) and to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland (over €2 million) for services delivered.  The Health Service Executive is also making progress in the provision of stand-alone Dementia Units on a gradual basis.  Since the report was published supports have also been enhanced in relation to community nursing, paramedical services and home help services.  In terms of dementia specific services, new day care centres and residential units have been designed and developed in partnership with the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland.  Home care services have also been specifically developed to meet the needs of persons with Alzheimer's and their carers.  All of the above provisions apply to all Dementia sufferers, regardless of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">There is a complementary link between Government policy in the area of the care of older people and in care for people with dementia.  Both policies stress the need to provide support in dignity and independence, through the provision of appropriate services to the people concerned and their carers.  The Government is fully committed to providing such support and service improvement, including the expansion of community and residential care services for people with Dementia.  This commitment was reflected in the additional funding of €150 million allocated in the 2006 Budget towards improving services for older people and palliative care.  Approximately two thirds of this money is allocated to community support for older people.  This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1609">The additional funding provided for Home Care Packages and the Home Help Scheme will further enhance the supports available to families caring for people with dementia at home.  The Health Service Executive works closely with the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland and this has resulted in greater awareness of the needs of people with dementia and the development of a wide range of supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1610">I assume that the Deputy is referring to the recent study Perceptions of Stigma in Dementia commissioned by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  The HSE welcomes the report which will further inform the strategic development of services for people with Dementia, their families and carers.  The HSE acknowledges the need for services to be developed in a flexible manner to meet the specific needs of clients and to ensure a continuum of care and will continue to work closely with the Society to further enhance the provision of a quality, seamless service.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1616">The Deputy will be aware that there have been significant improvements in the provision of supports for the development of quality child care over the last number of years.  These improvements are mainly as a result of the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective which have characterised its delivery.  The principal objective of the EOCP was to facilitate the development and expansion of quality child care facilities to address the needs of parents, in reconciling their child care needs with their participation in employment, education and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1617">As a result of the EOCP, by the end of 2005 parents had access to over 29,600 new child care places and to a further 23,700 existing child care places where quality improvements were EOCP supported.  It is expected that over 41,000 new quality child care places will be created by the Programme's end.  Furthermore, almost €183 million has been allocated to date under the EOCP in staffing assistance to community based not for profit organisations with a focus on disadvantage.  These staffing grants assist child care services to meet the costs associated with quality child care at an affordable rate for the parents concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">An integral part of the EOCP has been its specific provision for Quality Improvement projects, with over €67 million of programme funding to date being allocated to this area.  This has included EOCP funding for the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) and for 7 National Voluntary Childcare Organisations (NVCOs) to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the promotion of quality child care.  The CCCs offer a wide variety of services to childcare providers including training, information and networking.  They provide information and advice to existing and prospective child care providers and are the first point of contact for applicants for capital grants under the new National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP).  The CCCs arealso an important source of information and advice for parents in regard to local child care facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">In 2006 the CCCs received some €7.9 million funding under the EOCP and a further €4 million in funding to reflect their expanded role under the NCIP.  In addition, they received €1 million funding for the National Childminding Initiative which is a quality measure which supports quality awareness in the Childminding sector.  Since 2000, EOCP funding of almost €20 million, including over €2.7 million in 2006, has been provided to the NVCOs supported by the programme.  This has been used to provide supports for the NVCO members, for EOCP beneficiaries and for the broader child care sector and includes a range of activities in regard to quality assurance and promotion, best practice, networking and information provision, and professional development and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">The National Childminding Initiative, which is delivered by the CCCs, includes provision for small capital developmental grants to Childminders of up to €630, which can be used to buy safety equipment or toys, or make minor adjustments to the Childminder's home to enhance or establish a Childminding service.  The grants are linked to the completion of a Quality Awareness Lecture Programme (QAP) and to training, information and networking actions.  Funding totalling over €6.5 million has been made available for the initiative and, since January 2004, some 3,422 Childminders have participated in the QAP.  A further quality initiative, the Partnerships for Quality Childcare, was launched in May 2005 and provided funding of €573,000 for 7 collaborative projects between the CCCs and NVCOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">With the announcement in December 2005 of the new National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) with an allocation of €575 million, it is my intention to continue to support and enhance the development of quality child care in Ireland.  The new investment programme is designed to deliver 50,000 additional child care places in a way which meets the needs of parents and their children for a range of child care services centred on the needs of the child.  The NCIP is part of a new broadly based Child care Strategy, the aim of which is to deliver a more comprehensive approach to early years care and education.  I believe this will build on the existing successes under the EOCP in delivering quality child care services.</p>

            <p eId="para_1626">Radioactive iodine is no longer produced at Sellafield and an accident at that installation would not result in a release of radioactive iodine.  Therefore the use of iodine tablets as a counter measure in such an instance would not be indicated.  However, there is still a potential risk from other nuclear installations in the U.K. and elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">In 2005 a Review Group established by my Department to examine the issue agreed that the use of stable iodine should continue as a counter measure under the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents and that the shelf-life of the tablets be extended to January 2009, subject to yearly monitoring.  A public notice was placed in national newspapers advising that the tablets have maintained their efficacy and should continue to be stored in a cool, dry place in their original sealed packaging.  The issue of the safe disposal of the tablets does not therefore arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">In recent years the threat to Ireland has significantly reduced due to the closure of a number of the older reactors in the UK, in particular the Calder Hall reactors at Sellafield.  A programme of further closures is planned.  In the unlikely event of a nuclear incident, the health response would be in accordance with the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents produced by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_1642">The Child Care Act 1991 focuses on the child and the promotion of the child's welfare.  It also places a specific duty on the Health Service Executive to identify children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and to promote their welfare by providing child care and family support services.  This Act underpins the basic tenet that the welfare of the child is of paramount importance.  Therefore, should a case such as that outlined by the Deputy, come to the attention of the Health Service Executive, there is an onus on the HSE to determine whether such a young person is at risk and is in need of care and protection.  As the Deputy will be aware the intervention required would of course be dependent on the circumstances of the individual case and the needs identified by the HSE assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1643">In addition to the legal obligations put in place by the Child Care Act, Section 17 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997 sets out provisions relating to the unlawful detaining of children under 16 years of age and this section is summarised as follows: — It is an offence for a person to, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, intentionally take or detain a child under the age of 16 years or cause a child under that age to be so taken or detained, so as to remove the child from lawful control of any person who has lawful control of that child, or so as to keep him or her out of the lawful control of any person entitled to lawful control over the child.</p>

It is an offence in this country to supply prescription only medicines by mail order and provisions exist under the Prescription and Control of Supply Regulations to take action against anyone supplying prescription only medicines in this way.  The Irish Medicines Board is responsible for investigating breaches of the medicines legislation in Ireland and the Board works closely with the Customs and Excise authorities to enforce these provisions.</p>

However the difficulties associated with policing the Internet in general also apply to on-line sales of medicinal products.  The vast majority of internet pharmacies are based outside Ireland and this poses great challenges in the area of enforcement.  The Irish Medicines Board works in partnership with medicines enforcement agencies in Europe and elsewhere to address this and has in the past taken action against on-line pharmacies outside Ireland where appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1659">The National Disability Survey (NDS) is currently being undertaken by the CSO.  The survey broadly follows the definitions and principles outlined in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).  The survey questionnaires were finalised by the CSO in conjunction with a Consultative Group comprising representatives from Government Departments, the National Disability Authority, and organisations working within the disability sector.  Advice was also received from a broad range of other organisations and experts, both national and international.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">The overall objective of the Survey is to provide a more comprehensive picture of  persons reporting a disability in the Census of Population through an analysis of such factors as: the type of disability, the degree of severity, the ability to use transport and the built environment, and the extent to which people with a disability are enabled to participate in education, employment, and social life.  The survey also collects an extensive range of information on aids and supports that people use or need but do not have.  Examples of such aids include: voice amplifier; computer or keyboard; speech and language therapy; learning support software; medical services; counselling; psychotherapist; addiction services; relaxation techniques; and nebulisers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">The section on education identifies whether people need(ed) modified building features to attend school or college; specific supports or aids to follow their course (such as personal assistants; note-takers; adjustments to the curriculum and talking books).  That section also identifies whether people stopped their education sooner than intended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">The focus of the survey is therefore on persons with disabilities and not directly on the standard and quality of the disability services provided.  The data collected in the survey will, however, provide many indications of the extent to which the various needs of persons with disabilities are currently being met or not.</p>

         asked the

         the number of people currently employed in the drafting section of the Attorney General’s Office; the plans to recruit more staff; his views on whether more permanent staff are required and that the only way to acquire experienced parliamentary draftspersons is to give them the necessary experience; his further views on whether the outsourcing of this work means that staff are not getting this experience; his plans to deal with this staff shortage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_434">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_1972">The current sanctioned staffing levels for permanent staff in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is 19.  However, this figure can increase to 25 provided such an increase is offset by an identical reduction in the number of Contract Drafter positions.  At present there is 1 vacancy for a permanent member of staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">Earlier this year, in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service, the Office held a recruitment competition for permanent drafting staff.  Only three applicants were successful at all stages of the competition and were offered positions.  Of these, two accepted the offer and both have taken up duty in the last few months.  The remaining person declined the offer.  The Office intends to run another recruitment competition early in the New Year when the pool of eligible experienced candidates will have increased.</p>
            <p eId="para_1974">The Office has sanction to fill up to eight Contract Drafter positions in total.  Currently, it engages seven Drafters on a contract basis.  However, not all of these work full-time and consequently their contribution is equivalent to five full-time Drafters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1975">Most Contract Drafters engaged by the Office have significant drafting experience in common-law jurisdictions similar to our own.  In the past, all have previously held senior drafting positions, including former heads of office of the UK Office of Parliamentary Counsel, the Canadian Federal Drafting Office and the Office of the Scottish Parliamentary Counsel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1976">During their time in the Office, the Contract Drafters are also involved in the training of newer staff who can then benefit from the experience of both the contract staff and the permanent staff more senior to themselves.  There is a formal training programme for new drafters with heavy emphasis on practical experience.  The work of the Contract Drafters is structured to ensure that there is liaison between both contract and permanent staff to facilitate a transfer of skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1977">The continued engagement of Contract Drafters is currently necessary having regard to the extensive Government Legislation Programme.  The timescale within which complex and lengthy Bills are required to be produced puts a premium on experience which is significantly provided by the Contract Drafters, whereas the more recently recruited staff have not yet acquired such experience.  However, the engagement of Contract Drafters does not impinge on the experience opportunities provided to permanent staff.  When it is felt that there are sufficient experienced permanent staff available to the Office, the engagement of Contract Drafters will be phased out.  In that regard the position will be regularly reviewed.</p>

The fieldwork phase of this survey, involving interviews with approximately 17,000 persons, is currently being conducted throughout the country.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_2066">I am informed that An Garda Síochána has received in excess of 20 complaints from members of the public relating to fraudulent withdrawals from their bank accounts.  The offences are committed using a technique known as "phishing".  "Phishing" is the term used to describe the theft or attempted theft of personal information using e-mail and "bogus" web-sites.  It is a relatively recent phenomenon.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">The act of "phishing" constitutes a number of offences contained in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  In addition, a provision to give the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime the force of law in Ireland is included in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The Government has approved the drafting of the Bill along the lines of a General Scheme and the General Scheme has been forwarded to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting of the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">I am informed that a number of persons have been prosecuted on charges of theft offences relating to "phishing" incidents where the proceeds of fraudulent withdrawals have been transferred to an apparently legitimate account which has been used to facilitate the withdrawal of the stolen funds.  A number of other similar investigations are ongoing at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2069">I understand that An Garda Síochána is working with the Banking industry to counteract this phenomenon.  A High-Tech Crime forum has been established with all relevant stakeholders including An Garda Síochána and the Financial Services Industry including the banking sector.  This forum facilitates the rapid dissemination of information related to "phishing" and other methods being used in an attempt to compromise banking services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2070">I am also informed that The Irish Bankers Federation participates in the MakeITSecure campaign, a national information campaign aimed at educating consumers on how to use IT securely, particularly in relation to financial transactions.  MakeITSecure is a coalition of partners from the private sector as well as the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The campaign was launched by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Mr. Noel Dempsey T.D., in November 2005.  This website focuses on four areas — identity theft, "phishing", spyware and child safety on-line.  MakeITSecure aims to help individuals, families and businesses protect themselves by showing the main risks and offering some solutions to make their internet experience more secure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2071">Its aim is to raise public awareness of on-line security and provide practical information to help people use on-line resources safely and securely.  The campaign provides key messages to consumers in relation to "phishing" and how to avoid it.  Each institution reviews individual cases of "phishing" on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2072">I am also informed that in December 2003, the Financial Regulator issued a press release on the topic and continues to do so on a regular basis, the most recent press release being issued in June of this year.  A factsheet informing consumers as to how to protect themselves from fraud was also published in June 2004 and is available from the Financial Regulator's website.  All the information and communication from the Financial Regulator has reinforced the same warnings — that no bank would ever ask their customers to confirm any of their financial information by email or by entering details into a website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">I am informed that the Irish Payment Services Organisation is also very active in raising awareness of such issues.  I understand that most financial institutions publish warnings on their own website when they are the subject of such activities.  Victims of "phishing" attacks are advised by An Garda Síochána and the industry to report any such attack immediately to An Garda Síochána for investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">An Garda Síochána's primary function relates to the investigation of the criminal conduct through which the monies have been lost by the injured parties as opposed to the recovery of funds.  However criminal courts may make orders restoring funds which have been identified as the proceeds of crime following conviction of the offender.  I am confident that every assistance is given by An Garda Síochána to injured parties and their representatives in their effort to recover monies.  If a consumer is a victim of this crime, he or she should report the matter to the Gardaí and to their bank.  The best line of defence against this type of fraud is to educate consumers so they are aware that they should not disclose their personal financial information to anyone.</p>

            <p eId="para_2082">The Private Security Authority, established under the Private Security Services Act 2004 is the regulatory body with responsibility for regulating and licensing the private security industry in the State.  The Authority is independent in the exercise of its statutory functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">I am informed by the Authority that it has put a licence fee structure in place which reflects the variety between the different sectors of the industry and takes account of companies and employees who might be working in multiple sectors.  Fees also take account of the relative size of companies operating in any given sector.  Moreover, the Authority is obliged to become self-financing so licence fees must reflect the overall operating costs of the Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">The two-year licence fee was set taking into account the huge variety of cost models in the various sectors of the industry.  These range from low turnover, high staffing levels in the guarding sector, to lower staffing levels but higher turnover in other sectors such as electronics.</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">The private security industry itself supports regulation and has actively campaigned for it for many years.  The provision of a regulatory environment for the industry will understandably lead to structured cost implications.  However, it is the industry which will benefit from regulation and it is in line with Government policy that industry should fund such a development.  I can inform the Deputy that this matter was examined by the Board of the PSA at its meeting of 21 November 2005, which re-affirmed its previous decision in relation to the fee structure and decided that this issue would be revisited by the Board in the context of a review of licensing in two years time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">Staff of the Authority are available to offer advice and assistance to persons applying for private security services licenses.  In this regard, the Authority can be contacted on phone number 062 31588.  Alternatively, information is available on the Authority's website —<i>www.psa.gov.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_2113">In 2003 a team from the Central Mental Hospital, with the cooperation and support of the Irish Prison Service, undertook the first systematic survey of mental illness in the Irish prison population.  The findings of this study confirm that the rates of diagnosed mental illness among prisoners are significantly higher than in comparable community populations.  This finding is common to prison populations in many jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2114">The study found that drug and alcohol dependence and harmful use were by far the most common problems, present in between 61% and 79% of prisoners.  The rate for all mental illnesses ranged from 16% in male committals to 27% in sentenced men, while the comparable figures for females were 41% and 60% respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">My Department has previously published the findings of a study entitled ‘A Survey of the Level of Learning Disability among the Prison Population in Ireland'.  As I have previously stated (as indicated in my reply to Deputy Neville's question of 25 February 2003), there are strong reservations about interpreting the main finding of the study as suggesting that over 28% of the prisoner population in the country have a mental handicap.  Any such suggestion is strongly disputed by people who work with prisoners in a professional capacity on a daily basis and there is a reasonable basis for argument that this unexpectedly high figure could be accounted for by measurement of factors attributable to educational deficit and social disadvantage, rather than learning disability per se.</p>

            <p eId="para_2124">There has been no termination of prisoner education programmes.  As in any adult education setting, the range of courses or programmes available at the different education units will, of course, vary in accordance with prisoners' needs and local circumstances.  In several institutions there is a high level of turnover of the prisoner population, which requires a flexible approach with regard to the curriculum content.  Thus, on an ongoing basis, some courses may be discontinued and new ones offered in their place, but it would not be appropriate to regard such alterations as a termination of education programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">I am arranging to forward the Directory of Prison Education 2006 to the Deputy.  The Directory, which gives more details of what is available in the Education Units of different prisons, is prepared annually by the Irish Prison Service's Co-ordinator of Education.  Budgetary restraint measures introduced in 2004, in the absence of agreement with the Prisoner Officers' Association on the Change Programme, did impact on the level of some other services to prisoners, even though every effort was made by the prison authorities, and the providers of the services concerned, to minimise the difficulties involved.  While the effect on services varied from institution to institution it typically involved more limited access to libraries, gyms, workshops, schools and revised visiting arrangements.  In-reach services also experienced some disruption in their services to prisoners as a result of increased waiting times in gaining access to prisoner areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">The new working arrangements under the agreed Proposal for Organisational Change should, however, not only restore but enhance prisoner regimes in the years ahead, particularly in terms of improving availability and facilities, and making the most of out-of-cell time for prisoners.</p>

            <p eId="para_2170">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_2171">I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Glanmire Garda Station as at 31 December, 1997 was 14 (all ranks).  The personnel strength of Glanmire Garda Station as at 20 September, 2006 was 20 (all ranks).  This represents an increase of 6 (or 42%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.  The Garda authorities state that the current opening hours of Glanmire Garda Station are from 10am to 6pm Monday to Saturday and from 12pm to 1pm on Sundays.  Gardaí at Glanmire operate a 24-hour mobile patrol for the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2172">Garda Management state that the extension of the opening hours at Glanmire Garda Station would necessitate the employment of additional personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor duties.  Local Garda Management also state that they are satisfied that the arrangements currently in place in Glanmire are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2173">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Glanmire Garda Station will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_2219">The number of people travelling through Dublin Airport is in excess of twenty million per annum, a huge increase on the eight million passengers in 1995.  Senior Garda management at the Garda National Immigration Bureau are in regular contact with the Dublin Airport Authority to ensure the most efficient immigration facility possible is provided, within the existing structures, for the increasing numbers of persons who must be processed in compliance with immigration laws and regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2220">The development of Dublin Airport to cater for the ever-increasing number of people travelling through the airport is a matter for the Dublin Airport Authority.  An additional pier is under construction and is due for completion in late 2007, while a proposed second terminal is expected to be operational in the second half of 2009.  Enhanced immigration facilities will be a feature in both and Garda management at the GNIB will liaise with the Airport Authority in this regard.  Over 8,000 persons have been refused permission to land at Dublin Airport since 2004 and every effort is being made to keep any inconvenience to travellers at a minimum while enforcing immigration legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2222">I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the issue of guidelines in relation to the operation of Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) and the content of such guidelines is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed that in choosing a location for a MAT checkpoint regard is had to where it would be most effective and to the objective of reducing fatalities caused by drink driving.</p>
            <p eId="para_2223">Section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 provides the legal basis for Mandatory Alcohol Testing.  MAT checkpoints may only be established under written authorisation of a member of An Garda Síochána not below the rank of Inspector.  An authorisation shall be in writing and shall specify the date on which, and the public place in which, the checkpoint is to be established and the hours at any time between which it is operated.</p>
            <p eId="para_2224">Section 4 of the Act confers a statutory power to administer the breathalyser to a motorist stopped at a MAT checkpoint without a member of An Garda Síochána being required to form an opinion that the motorist has consumed alcohol, been involved in a collision or breached a provision of the Road Traffic Acts.  This statutory power is without prejudice to any powers, including the powers under section 12 (roadside breath testing) (as inserted by the Act of 2003) of the Road Traffic Act 1994, conferred on a member of An Garda Síochána by statute or at common law.</p>
            <p eId="para_2225">To monitor and ensure standardisation and consistency of the MAT checkpoint a systematic method of data collection is in place.  Members operating MAT checkpoints are requested to be mindful of An Garda Síochána Code concerning precautions to be taken by members when operating checkpoints.</p>

In relation to the first person in question, information in respect of the immigration status of the reference in Ireland was not supplied and in respect of the second person in question it was considered by the Visa Officer  that insufficient evidence of finances was demonstrated.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_2249">I propose to take Questions Nos. 279 to 283, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2250">At the outset I should say that as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I play no role in the prosecution of offences and both the decision to initiate a prosecution and the subsequent conduct of that prosecution are functions exclusively assigned (with limited exceptions) to the DPP under the Constitution and the relevant statutory provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2251">The issues to which the Deputy refers have their origin in the circumstances surrounding the arrest and detention of seven persons at Burnfoot in Donegal in May 1998 and the investigation relating thereto.  Those precise circumstances formed part of the terms of reference of the Morris Tribunal as approved by resolution of Dáil and Seanad Éireann on 28 March 2002.  I concur with the view expressed by Mr. Justice Morris in the recent Burnfoot report that the question of whether or not immunity was correctly granted to a Detective Garda is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Indeed Mr. Justice Morris also pointed out that it was perfectly obvious that immunity would be essential if there were to be any hope of the Detective Garda giving evidence at the criminal trial of Detective Sgt John White — even though the Detective Garda in question never held out for immunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2252">Section 6 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974 makes it unlawful for persons other than defendants or complainants in criminal proceedings, or persons likely to be defendants or their legal or medical advisers, member of their families or social workers to communicate with a member of the Garda Síochána or the Director for the purposes of influencing a decision — including a decision to withdraw or not to initiate criminal proceedings.  It is of relevance to point out that  Mr. Justice Morris has stated that the documentation from the Gardaí seeking the immunity from the Director was both "logical and proper".</p>
            <p eId="para_2253">With regard to the investigation itself, in February 1999, the Garda Commissioner established an investigation team under Assistant Commissioner Kevin Carthy to examine allegations made in relation to members of the Garda Síochána in Donegal.  A number of investigation files were submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions — including a file relating to the case to which the Deputy refers.  On 13th June 2001 a Detective Garda made a statement to a Chief Superintendent in relation to the planting of a firearm at Burnfoot, Co. Donegal on 22 May 1988.  The Detective Garda implicated a Detective Sergeant in the matter.  The Chief Superintendent made an operational decision not to arrest the member in question as he was entitled to.  He handed the matter over to the Assistant Commissioner and his investigation team.</p>
            <p eId="para_2254">I am informed that an investigation file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is normal practice for senior Garda officers to consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions in criminal cases and this occurred in this case also.  I am informed that the DPP directed that the Detective Sergeant be charged with the unlawful possession of a firearm on 22 May 1998.  I am further informed that on 20 June 2001 verbal directions were issued by him granting the Detective Garda immunity from prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2255">With regard to the question of the lost exhibits I am informed by the Garda authorities that an investigation under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations is ongoing and another has been completed.  Two other members involved in these matters have since retired and are therefore not subject to those Discipline Regulations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2257">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 12,762 on Friday 8 September following the attestation of 249 new members.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_2258">Garda Divisional boundaries do not correlate with county boundaries.  I have been further informed that the personnel strength (all ranks) of each of the Garda Stations in the Carlow/Kildare and Waterford/Kilkenny Garda Divisions, as at 31 December, 1997-2005, inclusively, and as at 20 September, 2006 was as set out in the following tables:</p>

            <p eId="para_3027">This represents an increase of 63 (or 21%) in the number of Garda personnel allocated to the Waterford/Kilkenny Division during that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3028">In addition, I would point out to the Deputy that the Garda resources for these Divisions are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.</p>
            <p eId="para_3029">It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_3030">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the areas referred to by the Deputy will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

As a consequence it is not the general policy to extend permission to remain to persons who are admitted initially for a period of 90 days or less on a C visa.</p>

Garda units are directed to pay particular attention to locations where youths tend to congregate.  This strategy will continue to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_3046">Under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, an unmarried father of a child may apply to the court for an order giving directions on any question affecting the welfare of the child including the question of access to the child.  In making such orders the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  Where appropriate and practicable, the Court in making any order takes into account the child's wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  In considering whether to make an order under section 11, the court, further to section 11D (as inserted in the Act of 1964 by the Children Act 1997) must have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3047">The Act of 1964 (again by way of amendments in the Children Act 1997) encourages parties to a dispute in relation to a child to agree on the custody or guardianship of or access to a child.  Prior to institution of proceedings the legal representatives of the parties must discuss with them the possibility of agreement.  The Court may adjourn any proceedings to assist agreement between the parties.  These legislative provisions are extensive.  They permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's care and upbringing having regard to the child's best interests.  I am of course aware of the concerns of fathers regarding custody and access rights and can assure the Deputy that the operation of the law in this area is being kept under review in my Department.</p>

As the Deputy is aware, a key issue to be addressed in the installation of the Finglas Town Centre CCTV system is the provision of suitable accommodation to house the monitoring equipment.

            <p eId="para_3103">The average processing time for a certificate of naturalisation is approximately 24 months.  The situation regarding post-nuptial citizenship is more complex as the statutory provisions providing for the process of post-nuptial citizenship were repealed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001, which came into effect on 30 November 2002.  A transition provision contained in the Act enabled persons who married Irish citizens prior to 30 November 2002 to make a declaration on or before 29 November 2005.  The final months of the transition period saw a substantial increase in the number of declarations received.  In my own Department, this resulted in 1859 declarations from persons residing in Ireland being received during 2005 — a significant increase on previous years.  Of this number, approximately 250 remain to be finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_3104">Declarations of persons resident outside Ireland are processed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the processing time for those applications is therefore a matter for my colleague in that Department.</p>

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.

In addition, I would point out that the Division's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.</p>
            <p eId="para_3112">Garda authorities state that on 8 September, 2006, an additional forty Gardaí were allocated to Shannon Garda Station following a review of the on-going security operation at Shannon Airport.  This was in addition to the original twenty Gardaí allocated on commencement of the security operation at Shannon Airport.  The allocation of personnel to Clare Division is closely reviewed and monitored by local Garda management.</p>
            <p eId="para_3113">It should be borne in mind that any interpretation of the crime figures should factor in the increase in our population in the past ten years.  In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population.  In the year ending June, 2006 (the most recent period for which figures are available), with a population of 4.23 million people, there were 24.9 crimes per 1,000 of the population.</p>

            <p eId="para_3131">The  persons concerned with their child claimed asylum in the State on 16 October 1998.  A formal declaration of refugee status issued to them by letter dated 6 November 2000.  This communication also advised them of their rights and entitlements attaching to refugee status including entitlement to an Irish issued travel document.  No application has been received from them for the return of any travel or identity documents such as passports.  However, I should point out that the use of their own national passports or travel documents would be regarded as inconsistent with their refugee status given that the basis of their successful asylum claim was the inability of their home country to afford them the protection they sought.</p>

Notice of the deportation order was served on the person concerned at his last known address in the State.  His legal representatives were provided with a copy of this correspondence also.</p>
            <p eId="para_3134">The Government decision of 26 July 1999 announcing the right to work in respect of certain categories of asylum seekers effectively meant that all asylum seekers whose applications were over 12 months old and which had not been finally determined, could lawfully seek employment in the State.  This right to work ceased once the asylum application was finally determined and the person concerned was refused refugee status.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3148">I propose to take Questions Nos. 317, 342, 344 and 364 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3149">I wish to advise the Deputy that the case of the person concerned falls under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation, Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003.  This Regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of ‘asylum shopping' across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one member State.  At the same time, it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of ‘refugees in orbit', a situation which had pertained in Europe prior to the introduction in 1995 of its predecessor, namely the Dublin Convention.  Under the Dublin Convention, and now the Dublin II Regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) can, on the basis of relevant criteria, request another State to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that other State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3150">The person concerned lodged an asylum claim in this State on 18 April, 2006.  Following investigation it was established that the person had previously made an asylum application in the United Kingdom.  It was therefore determined by the ORAC that, pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, the United Kingdom was the appropriate State to process the application as the person concerned had previously lodged an asylum claim there on 15 February, 2005, albeit under a different name, date of birth and nationality.  The person concerned was afforded an opportunity to appeal the determination of the ORAC to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which she duly did on 18 July, 2006 through her legal representatives, the Refugee Legal Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3151">Following consideration of the Appeal, the Tribunal upheld the determination of the ORAC, that is, that the person concerned should have her asylum claim examined in the United Kingdom and she was formally notified of this decision by letter dated 30 August, 2006.  The person concerned was kept informed of developments throughout the course of her asylum application in Ireland and was made aware as soon as it was possible to do so that her case came under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3152">The United Kingdom accepted responsibility for the case of the person concerned with the consequence that a Transfer Order was signed in respect of her on 14 July, 2006.  This Order was issued to the person concerned on 17 July, 2006, requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 24 July, 2006 to make arrangements for her transfer to the United Kingdom.  As a consequence of the Transfer Order, she was transferred to the United Kingdom on 4 September, 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3153">The situation in the home country of the person concerned and her need, if any, for international protection are matters for the United Kingdom to consider as part of its examination of her asylum claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_3154">In relation to appeals under the Dublin II Regulation, I must point out to the Deputy that the making of an appeal to the Tribunal does not, of itself, operate to suspend the transfer of a person's asylum application nor indeed the person themselves.  The appeal can be pursued from the receiving country.  Of course, if an appeal is successful, arrangements are made to allow the person concerned to re-enter the State and have their asylum application determined substantively by the ORAC.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3182">The case referred to by the Deputy falls under the scope of the Dublin II Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003).  This Regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of ‘asylum shopping' across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one State.  At the same time it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of ‘refugees in orbit', a situation which had pertained in Europe prior to the introduction in 1995 of its predecessor, namely, the Dublin Convention.  Under the Dublin Convention, and now the Dublin II Regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) can, on the basis of relevant criteria, request another State to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that other State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3183">The person concerned lodged an asylum claim in this State on 21 April, 2006.  Following investigation, it was determined by the ORAC that, pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, the United Kingdom was the appropriate State to process the application as the person concerned had previously lodged an asylum claim in that State, on 19 November, 2004, albeit under a different name and date of birth.</p>
            <p eId="para_3184">The person concerned was offered an opportunity to appeal the determination of the ORAC, to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which he duly did on 4 August, 2006 through his legal representatives, the Refugee Legal Service.  Following consideration of the Appeal, the Tribunal upheld the determination of the ORAC i.e. that the person concerned should have his asylum claim examined in the United Kingdom and he was formally notified of this decision by letter dated 25 August, 2006.  The person concerned was kept informed of developments throughout the course of his asylum application in this State and was made aware as soon as it was possible to do so that his case came under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3185">The United Kingdom accepted responsibility for the case of the person concerned with the consequence that a Transfer Order was signed in respect of him on 19 July, 2006.  [Transfers under Dublin II Regulation are non-suspensory and the making of an appeal to the Tribunal does not, of itself, operate to suspend the transfer on foot of any Transfer Order that might be made under Article 7(1) of the Refugee Act 1996 (Section 22) Order 2003 (SI No 423 of 2003).  Furthermore, the appeal can be pursued from the receiving country, in this case the United Kingdom.  Of course, if the appeal is successful, arrangements are made to allow the person concerned to re-enter the State and have their asylum application determined substantively by the ORAC].</p>
            <p eId="para_3186">This Order was issued to the person concerned on 20 July, 2006, requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 26 July, 2006 to make arrangements for his transfer to the United Kingdom.  However, he failed to present as required and is now recorded as having evaded his transfer.  He is currently illegally present in the State and is liable to arrest and detention.  He should present himself to An Garda Síochána without further delay so that final travel arrangements can be made to effect his transfer to the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p eId="para_3187">In accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, the United Kingdom, and not Ireland, is responsible for examining the asylum claim of the person concerned, given that he made his initial asylum claim there.  In the event of the United Kingdom refusing his asylum application after due consideration, it is a matter for that country to decide whether to return him to his home country.  In making that decision the UK like all other signatories (including Ireland) to the 1951 UN Convention of the Status of Refugees is obliged to satisfy itself as to the safety of returning the person, or <i>refoulement</i> as it is referred to, before making any return decision.</p>

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order.

            <p eId="para_3284">The person concerned arrived in the State on 7 March, 2003 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_3285">The person concerned was informed by letter dated 22 September, 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3 (3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3286">His case was examined under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations received on his behalf from his legal representatives for temporary leave to remain in the State.  On 10 December 2004, I refused temporary leave to remain in the State and signed a deportation order in respect of him.  Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 20 January 2005, in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State.  The person concerned failed to present himself as required and was classified as evading his deportation.  He should present himself to the GNIB without delay.  The effect of the deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3287">The Deputy may wish to note that, in addition to the eleven factors contained in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), I must, as stated earlier, also have regard for Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement before making a deportation order.  This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to Angola and other third countries.  In this case, I am entirely satisfied that there are no refoulement related reasons to prevent the deportation of the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3288">I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and subsequently for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.  The enforcement of the deportation order is now an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</p>

            <p eId="para_3323">Section 6 of the Immigration Act, 2004 states that a non-national coming by sea or air from outside the State shall not, without the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform, land elsewhere than at an approved port.  A non-national who lands in the State in contravention of the said section of the Act of 2004, is deemed to be a non-national who has been refused a permission to land in the State, and is guilty of an offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_3324">The Immigration Act, 2003 (Approved Ports) Regulations 2003, came into operation on 19th September 2003.  In these regulations "the Order" means the Alien's Order 1946 (S.R &amp; O. No. 395 of 1946).  For the purposes of the Order, the ports specified in Part 1 of the Schedule to the said Regulations set out the approved ports for non-nationals arriving in the State from places outside the State other than Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  Part 2 of the Schedule to the said Regulations set out the approved ports for non-nationals arriving in the State from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3325">Weston airport is not among the ports specified in either Part 1 or Part 2 of the Immigration Act, 2003 (Approved Ports) Regulations 2003.  Therefore, a non-national who lands at that airport, without the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform, is deemed to be a non-national who has landed without permission and commits an offence contrary to the provisions of Section 6(4) of the Immigration Act, 2004, in doing so.</p>
            <p eId="para_3326">The Minister for Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform, gave consent, pursuant to the provisions of Section 6(1) of Immigration Act, 2004, to non-nationals to arrive at Weston airport for a period surrounding the holding of the Ryder Cup golf tournament.  During that period of time, Immigration Officers attached to the Garda National Immigration Bureau were present at the airport concerned, at times when non-nationals were due to arrive, for the purpose of implementing relevant provisions of immigration related legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3327">The purpose of recent meetings held between management at the Garda National Immigration Bureau and personnel involved in the operation of Weston airport is to ensure that the airport authorities are fully aware of immigration related legislation pertaining to Ports.</p>
            <p eId="para_3328">There are currently no plans to deploy Immigration Officers to Weston airport as recent representations for Ministerial consent for this airport to be prescribed as an approved port will require detailed consideration and will take some time to finalise.</p>

            <p eId="para_3458">This represents an increase of 82 (or 29%) in the personnel strength of the Carlow/Kildare division during that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3459">Local Garda Management report that Naas Garda Station is the only Garda Station in the Division in which community based Gardaí are currently allocated.  There are currently three Gardaí allocated to the Community Garda Unit there.</p>
            <p eId="para_3460">There is currently one Sergeant and six Gardaí assigned to the detection and surveillance of the use of drugs and illegal substances in the Division.  One Sergeant and two Gardaí are attached to Newbridge Garda station, two Gardaí are attached to Carlow Garda station and two Gardaí are attached to Naas Garda station.</p>
            <p eId="para_3461">Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</p>
            <p eId="para_3462">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Carlow/Kildare Division will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_3465">Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that applicants for naturalisation, other than spouses of Irish citizens, must have been resident in the State for five years of the nine year period prior to the date of application.  Residence in this context means residence for which the applicant had the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and where such permission was not for the purpose of study or seeking asylum.  Generally speaking, reckonable residence is calculated from stamps in applicants' passports and from Departmental and Garda records.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3469">I propose to take Questions Nos. 388 and 389 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3470">The Children Act 2001 is the primary statutory framework for the youth justice system.  It adopts a twin-track approach — child welfare and youth justice — to addressing the needs of children who may be in need of special care or protection and offending children.  Responsibilities under the Act span three relevant Government Departments: my Department and the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_3471">While it was always the intention that the Children Act 2001 would be introduced on a phased basis, given the scale and complexity of the issues involved, and significant new sections and amendments introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, a considerable portion of the Act has already been brought into force by both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3472">In relation to those provisions for which my Department has responsibility, Statutory Instrument (S.I.) 151 of 2002 commenced a range of provisions including provisions concerning the Garda Diversion Programme, the treatment of child suspects in Garda stations, the Children Court, child protection measures and some powers of the Court.   S.I. 468 of 2004 commenced provisions in respect of family conferences.  The Statutory Instruments list the sections and sub-sections commenced by them and copies follow for the information of the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3473">The provisions of the 2001 Act, as amended, which are under the remit of my Department, and which remain to be commenced, primarily concern the age of criminal responsibility, community sanctions and youth detention.  While these matters come within my remit, it should be noted that functions under the Children Act 2001 have been delegated under S.I. 474 of 2002 to Mr. Brian Lenihan T.D., Minister for Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3474">Provisions affecting the age of criminal responsibility have been amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and will come into effect on 16 October 2006.  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 amended a number of other provisions of the 2001 Act, primarily in respect of youth detention, responsibility for which will transfer from the Department of Education and Science to my Department.  Preparations for the introduction of the new detention system are well underway.  Significant work has also been carried out by the Probation Service to implement the community sanctions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3475">It is the intention of both myself and the Minister for Children to bring into force the remaining provisions of the Children Act 2001, as amended, in early 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3476">The table lists the sections and subsections which have yet to be commenced which come within the remit of my Department.  The table also lists the new sections and amendments introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which await commencement.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3599">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 12,762 on Friday 8 September following the attestation of 249 new members.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_3600">I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of the station referred to by the Deputy, as at 25 September, 2006, was 2 Gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_3601">Garda management state that at present the Sergeant in Charge at Carrigans Garda Station is responsible for the supervision of the Garda Station referred to on a daily basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3602">It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_3603">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the station referred to by the Deputy will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

         if, in view of his recent comments that the Government does not need all the money it is raising, he will consider devoting additional resources to the immigration section to help clear the long backlogs in residency and citizenship applications, to facilitate access to the telephone helpline, which is currently available only at limited hours and at those times is extremely difficult to get through to; and to make it possible for immigration staff to respond to written and email inquiries, which is not happening at present.

            <p eId="para_3628">The allocation of resources within the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is kept under ongoing review by its Director General having regard to overall sanctioned staff numbers.  INIS was established by the Government in 2005 in order to provide a single contact point or "one stop shop" for immigration services generally.  A key priority of INIS is to continue to enhance customer service provision across the wide range of services which it provides including asylum determinations, citizenship applications, visas, repatriations, reception and integration services as well as other immigration related functions generally.  With the ongoing decrease in asylum applications significant numbers of posts have been relocated from the asylum agencies to other immigration functions by INIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_3629">In relation to the immigration services referred to by the Deputy, as I outlined already, INIS is committed to providing a high quality service to all its customers and making every effort to process all residency applications and related queries in as timely a manner as possible.  The Immigration Division of INIS has a team led system to deal with the various categories of applications for residency.  Applications are dealt with strictly by date of receipt in order to have a system in operation which is fair to all  customers.  Where urgent residency applications are brought to the attention of the relevant section, every effort is made to facilitate them.  There is an ongoing increase in the number of applications received for residency in the State.  The resources allocated to process such applications are necessarily dependent on the prioritised work requirements of INIS at any one time.  Because information technology plays a key role in enhancing and streamlining work processes, work is due to commence shortly on the development of a comprehensive new information technology system for the INIS which will contribute to the enhancement of service provision generally in that organisation.  This new system should come into operation in late 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_3649">Following the receipt of recommendations from a working group, consisting of representatives of my Department, the Department of Transport, the Garda Síochána and the National Roads Authority, the Government approved proposals by my colleague the Minister for Transport and me on what elements of the provision and operation of speed cameras might be outsourced by the Garda Síochána, how this might be done and what legislative changes would be necessary.  Because of the characteristics of the State's road network, mobile cameras offer the most effective solution, although the use of fixed cameras may be relevant at a small number of locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3650">Following the enactment of the Road Traffic Act 2006 there is now a legislative basis for outsourcing elements of the provision and operation of speed cameras.  Work has commenced on the necessary procurement process.  Given the complexity of the process and in order to ensure adherence to EU and national procurement regulations, including the prescribed time periods, procurement support services required to facilitate the outsourcing process have been engaged and are working with my Department, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Transport and the National Roads Authority in moving this process forward with all possible speed.  Work is well advanced on the preparation of a call to the market for expressions of interest in tendering for the project.  Following the call for expressions of interest, a number of candidates will be awarded pre-qualification status and short-listed to proceed to the next stage.  A request for tenders will be made to the short-listed candidates, and the successful candidate will be selected on the basis of the tenders received.</p>
            <p eId="para_3651">In parallel with this process, work is ongoing with the Garda Síochána and the National Roads Authority on identifying locations that either have a speed related collision history or are of a type where a higher than expected frequency of collisions may be expected to occur.  Monitoring of driver speeds by the outsourced service provider will focus on these locations.  I can assure the Deputy that I attach a very high priority to outsourcing and expanding the speed camera network and to ensuring there will be no undue delay in the procurement process.  I expect the outsourcing of speed cameras to take place in the first half of 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_3653">The Private Security Authority, established under the Private Security Services Act 2004 is the regulatory body with responsibility for regulating and licensing the private security industry in the State.  The Authority is independent in the exercise of its statutory functions.  I am informed by the PSA that the Authority has put a licence fee structure in place which reflects the variety between the different sectors of the industry and takes account of companies and employees who might be working in multiple sectors.  Fees also take account of the relative size of companies operating in any given sector and the relative salaries of employees working in these sectors.  Moreover, the Authority is obliged to become self-financing so licence fees must reflect the overall operating costs of the Authority.  The two-year licence fee was set taking into account the huge variety of cost models in the various sectors of the industry.  These range from low turnover, low pay, high staffing levels in the guarding sector, to lower staffing levels but higher turnover and higher pay in other sectors such as electronics.</p>
            <p eId="para_3654">The private security industry itself supports regulation and has actively campaigned for it for many years.  The provision of a regulatory environment for the industry will understandably lead to structured cost implications.  However, it is the industry, both employees and employers who will benefit from regulation and it is in line with Government policy that industry should fund such a development.  The proportionality of the fees was considered by the Private Security Authority which includes industry employee and employer representatives.  I am informed by the Private Security Authority that these fees do not interfere with the rights of the worker to earn his or her living in an occupation freely entered upon, under Article 1(2) of the 1996 revised European Social Charter.  The industry is now widely regulated in an EU context and until the enactment of the Private Security Services Act 2004 Ireland had the least restrictive regulatory regime of any EU jurisdiction.</p>

            <p eId="para_3658">As the Deputy is aware over the years numerous organisations have requested and have been given the assistance of Gardaí on a non-public duty basis.  Traditionally, Gardaí have been made available for the performance of such duties and the State has charged for their services.  This work is done by members of the Force who would otherwise be off duty.  At present, organisers of events pay for the cost of non-public duties performed by Gardaí on duty inside the event location (e.g. at sporting events, major G.A.A. or soccer matches, rock concerts etc.).  The cost of policing duties performed by Gardaí outside of the event location, such as traffic control, beat patrols and other policing duties which would be additional to those normally performed at the location are not paid for by the organisers of the event and fall to be paid from public funds.  The Garda authorities point out that in many cases, it is difficult to define where public duty ends and where non-public duty liability of the organisations begins but that the safety of the public must be the ultimate consideration.</p>

Measures put in place include the placing of barriers outside public houses where there is a particular concern of crowding and drinking on footpaths and roadways.  I am further informed that Gardaí on duty on such occasions, or in the vicinity of public houses where overcrowding onto footpaths is an issue, are pro-active in dealing with any attendant problems arising.  In addition, Garda patrol vans are also on patrol to assist at any area of concern in relation to drinking on public streets.</p>

Mr Michael McGrath, a barrister with experience in the licensing area is chairman of this Committee.  On the 18th August 2006 and on the 25th August 2006, the Committee advertised in the national newspapers inviting submissions from interested parties, groups or individuals in relation to the regulation of casinos.  Submissions to the Casino Regulation Committee were to be made in writing to the Secretary of the Committee no later than Friday, 15th September 2006.  These submissions will be evaluated by the Committee in the course of their deliberations.</p>

This Scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems.

The procedures describe the sequential steps which groups must take in relation to the local authority, local joint policing committee, local Garda Divisional Officer and finally the Garda Commissioner and have been circulated to the relevant groups.  The payment of grant assistance to Athy Town Council will proceed shortly subject to the successful outcome of consultations involving the Athy Joint Policing Committee and receipt of authorisation from the Commissioner.

            <p eId="para_3715">The disbursement of funding to services supporting victims of crime is a matter for the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime.  The Commission is an independent body established in March 2005 with a remit to: (a) devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and (b) disburse funding for victim support measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_3716">It should be noted that I decided to terminate funding for the Victim Support organisation with effect from 31st March 2005 because of reductions in service levels and concerns in relation to governance, accountability and value for money arising from ongoing internal difficulties in that organisation.  An independent review carried out early in 2005 concluded that the organisation was terminally damaged and that further funding of the organisation could not be justified.  In 2005 the Commission focused on supporting and promoting the existing services for victims of crime, particularly in the voluntary sector, in order to ensure continuity of services on the ground, pending the development of a national framework of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3717">I am advised that 71 applications for funding were received in 2005 after a public advertisement and were examined in detail by the Commission.  I understand that these included independent applications from a number of former elements of the Victim Support organisation as well as Victim Support.  The Commission examined each application on its merits and made an independent decision in relation to eligibility for funding.  €685,750 was distributed to 28 groups providing front-line services to victims of crime in 2005.  Victim Support received €72,250 in funding from the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_3718">The Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime placed another public advertisement in national newspapers in April, 2006 inviting applications for funding for the provision of services to victims of crime.  I am informed that the Commission has considered and allocated funding on the basis of applications received with the required supporting documentation.  I am also informed that Victim Support made a submission to the Commission for funding in 2006 but were advised by the Commission to forward a formal application,  and that such a formal application was received by the Secretariat to the Commission yesterday (26th September 2006).  I understand, that the Commission has also notified Victim Support that, as is the case with all applications, any allocation for funding for 2006 is dependent upon the provision of certain financial returns, and these have not been forwarded to date by Victim Support.</p>

            <p eId="para_3730">Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region on 17 May, 2005 with a view to addressing the problem of serious crime such as gun crime, robberies, burglaries and combating an emerging gun culture.  At my request Operation Anvil was extended outside the Dublin Metropolitan Region during 2006.  For the purposes of Operation Anvil Ronanstown and Clondalkin Garda sub-Districts are treated as a single operational area.  At present the total number of additional hours available to Ronanstown and Clondalkin Garda sub-Districts is 4,360 hours per month.  The following table which shows the statistics for Operation Anvil in the Ronanstown and Clondalkin Garda sub-Districts up to 17 September, 2006 indicates that the Operation has contributed to encouraging successes across a number of headings:</p>

I have also obtained funding to enable Operation Anvil to continue as long as it is deemed necessary in operational policing terms.  All operational personnel in the Dublin Metropolitan Region may be employed on Operation Anvil as the need arises. Personnel from the Garda National Units are also deployed on the Operation as appropriate.  The net incremental cost of the Operation from its commencement to 31 August, 2006 is €19.49m.  This figure includes the cost of overtime, travel and subsistence and other ancillary costs.</p>

Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.  I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources.</p>

These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.

The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.

An intoxicant includes alcohol, drugs or any combination of drugs or of alcohol and drugs.

            <p eId="para_3939">The person concerned was informed by letter dated 7 April, 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with Section 3 (3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3940">Her case was examined under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations received on her behalf from the Refugee Legal Service for temporary leave to remain in the State.  On 5 July 2006, I refused temporary leave to remain in the State and signed a deportation order in respect of her.  Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 15 August 2006, in order to make travel arrangements for her deportation from the State.  The person concerned failed to present herself as required and was classified as evading her deportation.  As such she is liable to arrest and detention under Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, for the purposes of ensuring her removal from the State.  She should therefore present herself to the GNIB without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_3941">The effect of the deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State.  The enforcement of the deportation order is now an operational matter for the GNIB.</p>

            <p eId="para_3956">In determining whether to make a Deportation Order or grant a person Temporary Leave to Remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, (as amended).  Temporary leave to remain is considered in every case regardless of whether representations are made by, or on behalf of, the persons concerned.  Statistics are not maintained in a way which distinguishes between those who have made an application for leave to remain and those who have not.  Moreover, it must be borne in mind that many of those who failed the asylum process, and who did not opt to return voluntarily or consent to deportation, nonetheless left the State before a decision to deport or grant leave to remain was made.</p>

            <p eId="para_3978">The operation of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme was reviewed by a special Interdepartmental Review Group.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3979">The Group's Report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the possible future development of the scheme.  The short-term recommendations in respect of the appeals process have been implemented.  The main change arising from these was that an increased number of members could be appointed to the Appeal Board, which facilitated a far greater number of appeal hearings than had been the case prior to the Report's publication.</p>
            <p eId="para_3980">In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.  This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</p>

         the reason for the delay in tax relief at source for mortgages; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that delays of up to six months occur; his plans to tackle this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4037">Tax relief on mortgage interest is applied ‘at source' by the mortgage provider since 1st January 2002.  The mortgage provider in turn claims back the tax relief directly from Revenue.  Since 2002, the number of new mortgage accounts for which interest relief was sought increased from 95,857 in 2002 to 113,673 in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_4038">New applications for relief at source can be notified directly to Revenue through the Revenue web site or by completing the mortgage details on a TRS1 application form.  New applications are notified to the relevant mortgage provider on a monthly basis by electronic file.  The mortgage provider in turn applies the tax relief by reducing the monthly payment by the equivalent of the tax relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_4039">There are currently no delays in processing new applications except where incomplete or inaccurate information is supplied in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4040">Many applications for interest relief are in respect of mortgages that commenced in previous years.  The timescale for processing the refunds due in respect of the earlier years usually takes one month additional to the month for granting current relief.  This is due to the fact that the mortgage account has to be confirmed as a valid home mortgage through the electronic file exchange with the mortgage provider.  As with new applications, there are no backlogs except where incomplete or inaccurate information is supplied in the first instance.</p>

            <p eId="para_4294">The position is that the VAT treatment of goods and services is governed by EU law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Where homecare services are provided directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE), they do not generally come within the scope of VAT, as Public Bodies are not regarded as taxable persons.  This means that they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on their input costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4295">However, where homecare services are provided by private companies for a consideration in the course or furtherance of business, the provider may be obliged to register and account for VAT at the appropriate rate depending on the type of service they provide.  Homecare provided to individuals consists of a variety of services which may be liable to VAT at different rates.  The current VAT treatment of such services is in accordance with EU Sixth VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In addition, it would not be possible under EU Law to introduce a VAT refund scheme in respect of homecare services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4296">However, my Department is examining in consultation with the Department of Health and Children the scope within the relevant EU Directives to exempt the provision of such services from VAT in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_4305">In December 2004, the European Commission issued an infringement notice concerning the VAT treatment of public bodies.  This arose on foot of a complaint regarding the fees charged by local authorities for the provision of off-street car-parking facilities.

            <p eId="para_4306">Ireland replied to the infringement notice in April 2005.  The Commission responded with a Reasoned Opinion on the 4th of July 2006 which reiterated their concerns regarding the Irish legislation.

            <p eId="para_4310">I am not aware that the Capital Acquisitions Tax system is unduly burdensome.  The rates have been halved in many cases in recent years and the scope of the tax considerably narrowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4311">For the purpose of Inheritance Tax, the relationship between the person who provided the inheritance (the disponer) and the person who received the inheritance (the beneficiary), determines the maximum tax-free threshold — known as the "Group threshold".  Apart from the total exemption of transfers between spouses, there are three Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer and these Group thresholds are indexed annually by reference to the Consumer Price Index as published by the Central Statistics Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_4312">The indexed Group thresholds for 2006 are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4313">Group A: €478,155. This applies to inheritances received by a child, a step-child and a foster child from a parent.  Group A also applies in certain circumstances to inheritances received by a parent from a child and by a grandchild from a grandparent.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4314">Group B: €47,815.  This applies to inheritances received by brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, grandchildren and parents.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4315">Group C:  €23,908.  This applies to inheritances received by a beneficiary who does not come under Group A or B.</p>
            <p eId="para_4316">Any prior inheritances received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold are taken into account when calculating whether inheritance tax is payable on the current inheritance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4317">A niece or nephew who receives an inheritance is entitled to the Group A threshold of €478,155 provided certain conditions are fulfilled.  These conditions are that the niece or nephew has worked substantially on a full-time basis for the disponer in the 5 years ending on the date of the inheritance in carrying on the business of the disponer and the inheritance consists of property, which was used in connection with the business.</p>
            <p eId="para_4318">There is also an exemption from inheritance tax for certain dwelling houses.  The purpose of this exemption is to benefit individuals who had been living in a house for a period prior to taking the benefit.  The main conditions attaching to the exemption are that the beneficiary of the dwelling house must have resided in the house for a minimum of 3 years prior to the inheritance and must not have had an interest in any other dwelling house.  In addition, the beneficiary must continue to occupy that dwelling house as his or her only or main residence for a period of 6 years commencing on the date of the inheritance.  This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be the subject of inheritance tax when it is transferred.</p>
            <p eId="para_4319">These generous exemptions exist to address hardship that might otherwise arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_4399">The supply of wood fuel products used for home heating and light are already subject to the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% under Article 28 (2e) of the Sixth VAT Directive.  This means that Member States had the option of maintaining, at a reduced rate of not less than 12%, any items not listed in Annex H of the Sixth VAT Directive, provided these items carried a reduced rate on 1 January 1991.  Ireland is one of only eight Member States that apply a reduced or parked rate to the supply of wood fuel products.  In Ireland the parked VAT rate equates to our reduced rate of 13.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_4400">In relation to providing an estimate for the average annual cost to the Exchequer of reducing the VAT on wood fuel products from 13.5% to 12%, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to furnish figures of the VAT take on wood fuel products, as the information furnished on VAT returns does not require this to be identified.</p>

            <p eId="para_4411">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, under the provisions of Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, where agricultural property comprised in an inheritance is disposed of within six years after the date of the inheritance, a claw-back of agricultural relief will only occur where the proceeds from the disposal are not fully expended in acquiring other agricultural property within a year of the disposal.  The extent of the claw-back relates to the amount of the proceeds not being so re-invested.</p>
            <p eId="para_4412">However, in the case where a person receives an inheritance of agricultural land and has claimed agricultural relief on the inherited land but then subsequently makes a voluntary gift of that land to a niece or nephew, a claw-back of the agricultural relief granted to the person when he or she inherited the land will not occur.  This is because, in this situation, no proceeds have been received for the disposal of the land and a claw-back of the agricultural relief granted can only occur where actual proceeds are received for the disposal and then not appropriately re-invested.</p>
            <p eId="para_4413">For Capital Acquisitions Tax purposes therefore, a voluntary disposition without the receipt of proceeds does not result in a claw-back of agricultural relief.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that depending on the circumstances a Capital Acquisitions Tax (gift tax) liability may arise for the niece or nephew.  If the Deputy has a specific case in mind he may wish to contact the Revenue Commissioners with further details.</p>

         the reason participants in defined contribution schemes are obliged to invest the residue in an annuity; the further reason a different option of investing in a flexible retirement fund is available to persons with PRSA; and the cost of allowing participants in defined contribution schemes the choice of purchasing an annuity or participating in a fund.

            <p eId="para_4419">Prior to the passing of the Finance Act, 1999, any person going on pension under a defined contribution scheme or a retirement annuity contract was required to purchase an annuity with the remaining pension fund moneys, following the drawdown of the appropriate tax-free lump sum.</p>
            <p eId="para_4420">The Finance Act, 1999 introduced changes which gave a significant degree of flexibility and personal choice to certain categories of individual in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans.  These choices include the options to purchase an annuity, receive the balance of the fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate) or to invest in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) or Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF).  Proprietary directors, self-employed individuals and certain employees/directors in non-pensionable employment represent the categories of individual who can exercise these options in relation to their pension plans.  The Finance Act, 2002 introduced the Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) the aim of which was to create an attractive alternative pension product which is flexible, portable and user-friendly.  The flexible options relating to the drawing down of pension benefits also apply to PRSAs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4421">While these flexible options for drawing down pension benefits are not available to members of employers' defined contribution schemes (who are outside of the categories of individual described above) in respect of benefits derived from standard contributions to the schemes, the flexible options do apply in respect of any Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) made by such members either to their main schemes or to separate AVC schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4422">As regards the cost of extending the options to members of defined contribution schemes generally, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the data available in relation to such schemes is not sufficient to enable a reliable estimate of the cost to be provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_4450">A duty exemption scheme for pilot projects in biofuels, was introduced by section 50 of the Finance Act 2004.  The purpose of the provision was to allow qualified and conditional relief from excise for biofuel used in approved pilot projects for either the production of biofuel or the testing of the technical viability of biofuel for use as a motor fuel.  Under this Scheme, excise relief was granted to eight successful applicants to the scheme from August 2005 for a total of 16 million litres of fuel.</p>
            <p eId="para_4451">The number of applications made for relief from excise duty under the pilot scheme clearly indicated the strong interest in developing a biofuels industry in Ireland and consequently I made provision in the Finance Act 2006 for a significantly expanded 5 year scheme of Mineral Oil Tax relief.  The scope of the relief extends to projects which are not just of a "pilot" nature.  This relief scheme, when fully operational, is expected to support the use and production in Ireland of some 163 million litres of biofuels per year, at a total five-year cost of over €200m.  The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources are currently assessing applications made for this excise relief, and once this process has been completed, and the necessary EU State Aid approval has been obtained, which is expected to be very shortly, excise relief will be available to those projects that emerge from the application process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4452">The level of excise relief available is that which had been proposed by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in advance of last year's Budget and is regarded as a figure which is sufficient to match Ireland's output potential in relation to renewable energy crops for motor fuels over the period of the scheme.  Opting for a Scheme where project applications are assessed in preference to a general blanket excise relief for biofuels ensures that projects chosen offer a greater degree of quality control to end-users and are best positioned to promote the long-term use of biofuels in the Irish market.</p>

            <p eId="para_4470">I am aware of the reports referred to by the Deputy, which my Department has brought to the attention of the Financial Regulator.  Under the Life Assurance (Provision of Information) Regulations 2001, a customer buying a life assurance product must receive information on the commission payable.  The objective is to ensure that the customer is aware of the amount of commission payable, to whom it is payable and the effect of charges on the performance of their product.  This means that the customer is able to opt out of the particular contract and/or to shop around for a better deal, either from another insurance company or from another intermediary.  Where there is evidence that a financial institution, such as an insurance company, is not meeting its obligations in making customers aware of commissions charged, the Financial Regulator has the power to investigate.  The Financial Regulator has also issued a Consumer Guide to Life Insurance which is available on <i>www.itsyourmoney.ie</i>.  If individual customers believe they were not properly informed about the commission they have paid, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p>
            <p eId="para_4471">It is open to an insurance company to arrange a commission in respect of sales irrespective of the distribution channel used, i.e. a broker or employee.  In general, the Financial Regulator has no role or powers in setting the charges or price of investment products.  However, in the case of products for pension purposes, the maximum charges on standard PRSAs cannot exceed 5% of contributions paid and 1% of the PRSA assets.</p>
            <p eId="para_4472">If the Deputy considers that commissions are being inappropriately charged in any specific instances, she should bring the matter to the attention of the Financial Regulator.</p>

            <p eId="para_4485">I have seen the recent newspaper report about the survey.  Customer surveys can be useful in providing feedback on service delivery.  In fact, I am advised that Revenue has recently conducted its own survey of SMEs, and while they are currently in the process of analysing the preliminary results, the indications from this survey are generally very positive as regards Revenue's service to businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_4486">I have also noted a recent comment by the Small Firms Association to the effect that they regard Revenue as being among the most proactive of Government Agencies when it comes to empathising with the needs of small business.  Therefore, one needs to seek a balance in reporting on such matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_4487">As far as a complaints mechanism is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that all taxpayers have a right, which is specifically recognised in Revenue's Customer Service Charter, to seek a review of the handling of their tax or customs affairs.  If the matter cannot be resolved locally, taxpayers can have their complaints referred to the Customer Service Manager in the relevant Region/Division.  If the situation still cannot be resolved, the taxpayer may have their case reviewed either internally by a senior Revenue officer outside the Region/Division or by an External Reviewer acting in conjunction with a senior Revenue officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4488">In addition of course, taxpayers have a full right of recourse to the Office of the Ombudsman, and this option has been availed of by taxpayers on a regular basis in the years since that Office was established, as indicated in the Annual Reports of the Ombudsman.</p>
            <p eId="para_4489">I understand that, over the years, these complaints procedures have operated successfully in relation to a wide range of issues.  Details of how to avail of Revenue's Customer Service Complaints procedures are set out in Revenue Leaflet CS4, which is available on <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_4490">On the alleged lack of expertise at the first point of contact, the Revenue Commissioners advise that they provide extensive training to their staff on all aspects of the operations of the Office and constantly review training needs of all staff.  Revenue recently signed an important new agreement with the University of Limerick for the delivery to its staff of an Honours Level degree programme in Applied Taxation.  Over 100 staff have already obtained a Diploma level qualification on that Programme.  Over the period of the agreement, close to 1,200 Revenue staff are expected to graduate from UL with a significant and relevant third-level qualification in taxation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4491">I am advised by Revenue that they continuously examine ideas to further improve service to all their customers, including tax practitioners, and indeed earlier this year, senior staff from Revenue conducted a series of interviews with the major tax practitioner bodies to seek their views.  Such ideas are regularly discussed in the Tax Administration Liaison Committee which is made up of Revenue and representatives of the main Accountancy Bodies, the Law Society and the ITI.</p>

            <p eId="para_4493">As the Deputy will be aware the Home Carer Tax Credit, formerly an allowance, was introduced in Finance Act 2000 and is designed to recognise the contribution made by a spouse who remains working in the home in order to care for certain dependent persons.  It was brought in in the context of the more favourable tax bands for individuals introduced at that time.  The credit may be claimed by a married couple who are jointly assessed for tax purposes, where one spouse cares for one or more dependent persons.  The dependent person is defined as a child in respect of whom child benefit is being paid i.e. in respect of a child up to 19 years of age where the child is in full time education, a person aged 65 years or over, or a person who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity.  The definition of a dependent person does not include a spouse.</p>
            <p eId="para_4494">The maximum tax credit due for the current tax year is €770.  While the home carer credit is generally not available to married two earner couples, there is an income disregard whereby the home carer may have some income in their own right without affecting their spouse's eligibility for the tax credit.</p>

            <p eId="para_4573">As the Deputy is aware from previous questions on the matter, I asked the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners last year to monitor the application of the current residency rules.  The Revenue Commissioners subsequently reported to me that, of the cases examined during 2005, there was no reason to conclude that the individuals concerned failed to comply with the statutory rules governing non-residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_4574">I have not sought any other consultancy study or review, nor has such a review been requested by the Taoiseach.</p>
            <p eId="para_4575">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible at present to identify the number of Irish domiciled individuals claiming to be non-resident for tax purposes as the information has not been captured in the past.  This information will be captured electronically from the 2005 returns, due by the end of October 2006, and this will facilitate the compilation of statistics for 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_4576">I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that enquiries relating to residence are part of their risk-based programme.  The methods and procedures used to verify claims for non-residency are constantly under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_4578">Section 15 of the Finance Act 2006 enacted my Budget Day announcement providing for the discontinuance with effect from the current tax year of the remittance basis of assessment for income tax in respect of employment income insofar as that income relates to the performance in the State of duties of the employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4579">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that individuals charged to tax on the remittance basis of taxation pay tax on the income concerned under the self-assessment system.  The Revenue Commissioners further inform me that the data sought by the Deputy on the numbers of workers affected by the measure cannot be separately identified because all foreign-sourced income, including income charged on the remittance basis, is grouped together and assessed for income tax under what is termed Case III of Schedule D.  In addition, those individuals chargeable on the remittance basis are obliged to declare only so much of the foreign income received in, or remitted to, the State.  Accordingly, details of un-remitted employment income under foreign contracts, in respect of which Irish tax was forgone, are not required.</p>
            <p eId="para_4580">Therefore, while the Revenue Commissioners cannot quantify the exact number of employers and employees who were using the remittance basis, it was clear from information derived from normal Revenue operations that remuneration structures using the remittance basis were widely promoted.  In particular, some offshore agencies targeted professionals such as pharmacists, doctors, dentists, engineers and architects, and others working in Ireland, offering foreign "off the peg" contracts purporting to ensure entitlement to the remittance basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_4589">The relevant information available is based on tax returns by individuals and companies of tax exempt income arising from stallion stud fees for the tax year 2004.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of such returns was 128 with the average exempt income reported at €224,707 and the lowest at €245.</p>
            <p eId="para_4590">Because of the Revenue Commissioners' obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers a figure for the highest amount of exempt income returned is not provided in relation to amounts exceeding €1 million due to the small numbers of returns with amounts exceeding that level.  There are 8 returns of stallion stud fees in excess of €1 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4591">I should point out, however, that Revenue are concerned at preliminary indications that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on exempt income and property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the 2004 Income Tax returns.  Revenue is engaging with the tax practitioner bodies to draw attention to these deficiencies and to rectify them.  Revenue has also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4592">The information regarding profits for tax purposes is not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted examination of the Revenue Commissioners records.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
         the rate of income tax paid by persons earning in excess of €100,000 per annum and upwards in bands of €20,000 per annum from 2000 for each year to date, distinguishing between single persons and couples, between PAYE taxpayers and those who are self employed and including taxpayers paying zero per cent and taxpayers paying tax at 20 per cent and below.

            <p eId="para_4708">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent basic data on incomes available from which information of the type requested by the Deputy could be derived are in respect of the income tax year 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_4709">The information requested is set out in the following tables for the income tax years 2000/01, 2001 "short" year, 2002 and 2003.  However, because of the Revenue Commissioners' obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers, the breakdown by income bands requested by the Deputy is not provided in relation to incomes exceeding €1 million due to the small numbers of income earners with incomes in excess of that level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4710">The Deputy will be aware that this material is dated in that major changes I made in my Budgets to the structure and extent of tax reliefs will increase the average tax rate for those on higher incomes using such reliefs.  Caution should be used in basing policy pronouncements on this data.</p>

            <p eId="para_6841">The 2001 short income tax year was a short transitional tax "year" running from 6 April to 31 December 2001 which preceded the first full calendar tax year 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002.  It should be noted that as PAYE taxpayers were charged to tax on their earnings in the period from 6 April to 31 December 2001 and self-employed taxpayers were assessed to tax for the short "year" on 74% of the profits earned in a 12 month accounting period, the income figures will not be directly comparable with those of earlier or later years.</p>
            <p eId="para_6842">A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.  Married couples and individuals with income chargeable to tax under both Schedule E and Schedule D have been classified in the attached tables by reference to the Schedule under which the larger amount of income is taxable.</p>
            <p eId="para_6843">The designation of a tax rate to an income earner in the tables is based on identifying the top tax rate applying to the taxable income of each earner.  To arrive at the figure for taxable income, the gross income is reduced by various relevant deductions and allowances such as capital allowances, losses, allowable expenses and retirement annuities.  In some cases, these will reduce the taxable income to nil.</p>
            <p eId="para_6844">Caution is required in comparing between years because data for 2002 and 2003 take account of DIRT paid by taxpayers, whereas the figures for 2000/2001 and the short tax "year" 2001 do not do so.  To identify and associate the DIRT paid figures at taxpayer level for the two earlier years could not be achieved without conducting a protracted examination of the Revenue Commissioner's records and amending supporting computer software.</p>
            <p eId="para_6845">The information on incomes is based on income returns on Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing about 95 per cent of all returns expected.</p>

            <p eId="para_6909">I believe the Deputy may be referring to the Revenue Commissioners' Studies "Effective tax rates of the top 400 earners: Report for the tax year 2001" and "Effective tax rates of the top 400 earners: report for the tax year 2002", which were published in March 2005 and June 2006 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_6910">The Revenue Commissioners in paragraph 4 of the report for the tax year 2001 set out changes in the methodology to be applied in such studies in quantifying and classifying tax paid.  The changes were that: deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) deducted at source from any deposit interest earned was to be included in the figure for income tax payable in all cases in computing the effective tax rate; and individuals paying some income tax, although amounting to an effective rate of less than 1%, were to be excluded from the 0% range and included in the less than 5% range.</p>
            <p eId="para_6911">An appendix to the report for the tax year 2001 showed the effect of these changes which was relatively minor.  That appendix then provided the comparative figures when the new methodology was applied in the report of the Revenue Commissioners on the effective tax rates of the top earners for the tax year 2002.</p>

            <p eId="para_7121">Stamp Duty is a charge on documents, which are mostly legal documents, used in the transfer of property.  Where a property is purchased, stamp duty is charged on the conveyance or transfer effecting change of legal ownership of the property concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_7122">If there is no conveyance, there is no stamp duty.  A builder or developer can, therefore, obtain a licence from a vendor to build on land owned by the vendor without incurring a stamp duty charge at that stage of the venture.  Once the buildings, whether commercial or residential, are completed, the conveyances or transfers of such properties to purchasers are chargeable to stamp duty in the normal manner unless specific exemptions are available to such purchasers, for example first time buyers.</p>
            <p eId="para_7123">It should be noted that, as the documentation in relation to such arrangements does not have to be stamped, the information necessary to establish the extent of these practices is not readily available to Revenue.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that accordingly they are progressing the review of the use of measures to avoid stamp duties by developers, builders etc in a broader context as part of their project on the construction sector in 2006 and will advise me of the outcome of the review when it is completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_7127">The position is that charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase.  Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_7128">Ministerial Orders have been used in a limited way to provide refunds of VAT on certain aids and appliances for the disabled and on medical equipment donated voluntarily to hospitals.  These Orders are focused and are designed to target specific circumstances.  However, under EU law, it would not be possible to introduce new schemes within the VAT Act 1972 to relieve charities from the obligation to pay VAT on goods and services that they purchase.</p>
            <p eId="para_7129">I would add that the tax code currently provides exemption for charities from Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax, Stamp Duty, Probate Tax and Dividend Withholding Tax.  Moreover, charities also benefit significantly from the uniform scheme of tax relief for donations, which was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and which, for the first time, allowed tax relief on personal donations to domestic charities and other approved bodies.  The relief is based on the taxpayer's marginal rate which for an individual donor could be as high as 42%.  In the case of donations from the PAYE sector the relief is given directly to the charities.</p>

            <p eId="para_7148">The operation of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme was reviewed by a special Interdepartmental Review Group.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7149">The Group's Report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the possible future development of the scheme. The short-term recommendations in respect of the appeal process have been implemented.  The main change arising from these was that an increased number of members could be appointed to the Appeal Board, which facilitated a far greater number of appeal hearings than had been the case prior to the Report's publication.</p>
            <p eId="para_7150">In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_7155">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is charged on the open market selling price (OMSP) of a vehicle in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_7156">OMSP is defined in Section 133 of the Finance Act 1992 and is the price inclusive of all taxes and duties which a vehicle may reasonably be expected to fetch on a first arm's length sale in the open market in the State by retail.</p>
            <p eId="para_7157">The OMSP of new vehicles in the State is declared to the Revenue Commissioners by a wholesale distributor, while the OMSP of imported second hand vehicles is determined by the Revenue Commissioners based on factors such as age, mileage and vehicle condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_7158">EU Member States are entitled under EU law to charge National taxes provided that such taxes are applied equally to imported and indigenous goods.  In this regard, VRT complies with EU law in that the VRT charged on a vehicle imported into the State is equivalent to the amount of residual VRT contained in a similar Irish vehicle which is registered in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_7159">Accordingly, in order to provide the same tax base for the application of the tax on the registration of vehicles sourced both in the State and abroad, VRT is charged on the OMSP of the vehicle and not on the purchase price of vehicles bought in other EU countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_7164">The Civil Registration (Amendment) Act, 2005, does not relate to marriages and is concerned solely with payment of fees and allowances to registrars.</p>
            <p eId="para_7165">The Civil Registration Act, 2004, which contains provisions relating to marriage, does not contain any provisions concerning bigamy.  The Act, however, does provide that correct information must be given to the Registrar of Marriages by the parties intending to marry.  False information, including false information in relation to marital status, is an offence under Section 69 of the Act.  This is currently covered in the Marriage Law (Ireland) Act, 1863 (26 Vic. Cap. 27), which will be repealed on commencement of Part 6 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004, which is expected to take place in the first half of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_7166">Bigamy has always been a specific offence and continues to be an offence under Section 57 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861, which states that bigamy is committed when a person, who is a party to a valid subsisting marriage, goes through a ceremony of marriage with another.</p>

            <p eId="para_7195">The administration of the civil registration system is statutorily a matter for an tArd-Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) and for Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages who operate under his general direction.  I have made enquiries of an tArd-Chláraitheoir and the position is set out as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_7196">When a person dies, it is the duty of a relative of the deceased to act as qualified informant.  This means that the relative must give to a registrar the information necessary to register the death, including a medical certificate of the cause of death (obtainable from the medical practitioner who attended the deceased within one month of the death), and sign the register of deaths.</p>
            <p eId="para_7197">In certain circumstances, a death is referred to the Coroner.  There is a legal responsibility on doctors, registrars, undertakers, Gardai, hospitals and nursing homes to inform the Coroner where a death occurs suddenly or unexpectedly, or from a cause unknown, unclear or unnatural, or where the deceased was not seen or treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month prior to death.</p>
            <p eId="para_7198">In such cases, the Coroner may request a post-mortem examination.  If the post-mortem shows that a death was due to natural causes, the Coroner may issue a certificate to the Registrar, who can then proceed to register the death and issue a death certificate.  If the post-mortem shows that a death was due to unnatural causes, the Coroner may cause an inquest to be held. In such cases, the Registrar must await the outcome of the inquest and the issue by the Coroner of a coroner's certificate, before registering the death.</p>
            <p eId="para_7199">An tArd-Chláraitheoir has made enquiries regarding this matter and informs me that there is no particular reason for any possible delays in issuing death certificates in the Limerick area and that he is satisfied that deaths are being registered promptly once medical certificates of the cause of death  and coroners certificates are received. In the case of coroners certificates, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the carrying out of the statutory procedures outlined often involves detailed examination of complex medical and legal matters that may take time to resolve.</p>

            <p eId="para_7223">Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child without reservation in September 1992. As part of the process of evaluating a county's progress in implementing the Convention, the Committee considers periodic State reports, in conjunction with shadow reports submitted by bodies concerned with children's rights and welfare within the State.  Ireland submitted its Second Report in July 2005 to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Report of the Ombudsman for Children was submitted subsequently as a shadow report in April of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_7227">A wide range of issues were covered by the Committee in their examination of Ireland's Second Report, including the assertion of children's rights within the Constitution, separated children seeking asylum, the age of criminal responsibility specifically in relation to the provision to allow for 10 and 11 year olds to be charged with a serious offence and the availability of appropriate mental health services for children.

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_7249">EU member states are the main purchasers of medicines in their domestic markets.   They naturally seek to control drug prices, but the extent of this control varies widely.  Higher priced countries, such as the UK and Germany, rely more on market forces to set prices.  Spain and Portugal, on the other hand, closely regulate and control prices.  Ireland's pricing policy is somewhere in the middle of the European league as, with its relatively small market, it must seek to balance value for money in state drug spending with reliability and continuity of supply for essential products.</p>
            <p eId="para_7250">Price comparison in different markets is difficult.  Patent protection in Ireland  allows originator companies exclusive rights to the market for ten years for new medicines.  In Spain, until 1992 there was no intellectual property protection for medicines and no patent protection for new products.  This has kept prices down, but may change with patent and intellectual property exclusivity, although the long lead-in time for product development and patenting will inevitably delay this.  In addition, some products that are prescription-only in Ireland are available without prescription in some states.  While the removal of prescription status for certain products may produce lower prices in Ireland, these products would no longer be reimbursed by the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_7251">The Deputy will be pleased to know that my Department and the Health Service Executive has recently concluded negotiations with the pharmaceutical manufacturers on an important new agreement setting out the pricing and supply of medicines for the Irish health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_7252">This new Agreement will provide increased value for money for the State and the consumer through a reduction in the price of existing drugs and medicines coming off patent, and through the use of a wider basket of countries for pricing new drugs coming on the market.  Over the period of the Agreement, which runs to 2010, it is expected to achieve savings of the order of €300 million across the GMS and community drugs schemes, and in the cost of drugs to hospitals, through off-patent price cuts of 35% for drugs with substitutable alternatives.  In addition to the savings quantified there will be further savings as generic manufacturers respond to the lower price of branded drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7253">There will also be savings through the use of a wider basket  for the pricing of new medicines coming onto the Irish market along with two price reviews for new medicines over the lifetime of the Agreement.  The new basket includes some traditionally lower priced countries, including Spain and Belgium, which will benefit the consumer over the medium term.  Finally, for the first time, reimbursement of new drugs coming onto the Irish market can now be informed by pharmacoeconomic assessment, in line with other EU countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_7254">This Agreement is the first in a series of negotiations approved by the Cabinet Committee on Health to examine all aspects of the drug delivery system, from the manufacturer to the patient, in order to achieve greater value for money from the operation of the drugs schemes, consistent with patient safety and continuity of supply.  Negotiations have already commenced with the pharmaceutical wholesalers (PDF) and talks with the community pharmacy contractors (retail pharmacists) will follow.</p>
            <p eId="para_7255">I must stress that no single measure will contain the rate of increase in expenditure on medicines and drugs.  Indeed, international experience has shown that this is a very difficult task, as the sophistication and range of treatments continue to increase along with increased expectations on the part of patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_7259">Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments.  The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_7260">Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient's eligibility.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process the Health Service Executive can take into account a range of measures including the household income guidelines, particular circumstances and the medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   In addition people over the age of 70 years have an automatic entitlement to a medical card regardless of income.  Application should be made to the local area office of the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_7261">In November 2004, I introduced a new graduated benefit — the GP Visit Card to extend free GP care and treatment to individuals and families on low incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_7262">In June last year, I simplified the means test for both medical and GP visit cards.  It is now based on an applicant's and spouse's income after income tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.  In 2005 the income guidelines for medical cards were increased by a cumulative 29 per cent.  The income assessment guidelines used for the GP visit card are 50% higher than those used for medical cards.  These improvements have made the assessment process much fairer and ensure that those on low to moderate incomes can qualify for free GP care.  Non-medical card holders can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €85 per calendar month, or approximately  €20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>
            <p eId="para_7263">In addition, the Deputy will be aware that non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</p>

            <p eId="para_7274">In making arrangements for the provision of publicly funded GP services, under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme, an arrangement was negotiated between my Department and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation.  The provisions of this agreement took the form of the current GMS GP Capitation Contract. This contract is a treatment based contract and gives effect to the statutory requirement to provide free GP medical and surgical services to eligible people which includes people aged 70 and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card. The contract stipulates that the fees paid to GMS GPs are not made in respect of certain certificates which may be required for example ‘under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences'.  As these non-treatment type services are outside the GMS GP contract it is a matter between the GP and the person seeking the particular services to agree a fee.</p>
            <p eId="para_7275">While certificates for driving licence applications are provided by medical practitioners they are not a medical treatment service and are not considered a core aspect of public health service provision.  Requiring such services to be provided within the terms of the GMS GP contract would more than likely lead to a costly counterclaim by GPs which if allowed would not represent appropriate or best use of resources in terms of current health policy.</p>

         the situation in relation to the Pharmacy Act 1962, which was suspended in 2001; when a new Bill will be put in place; the situation regarding foreign national qualified pharmacists married to Irish citizens who wish to register and practice as a pharmacist here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_7294">The Pharmacy Act, 1962 has not been suspended.  The Heads and General Scheme of a new Pharmacy Bill have been approved by Cabinet and are currently with the Parliamentary Council's Office for drafting.  It is my intention, subject to Cabinet approval, that the new Pharmacy Bill will be published and submitted to the Oireachtas in the Autumn.  The Bill will deal with the following matters:  firstly, changes to the governance of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland; secondly, provisions to update the registration process for pharmacists and introduce a registration system for pharmacies; thirdly, provisions for the introduction of a fitness to practice regime for pharmacists and pharmacy businesses.  Finally, miscellaneous provisions, including allowing for the removal of the derogation under Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC (the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU or EEA countries from owning, managing or supervising pharmacies that are less than 3 years old).</p>
            <p eId="para_7295">The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) is the statutory body with responsibility for the registration of pharmacists in Ireland.  The PSI operates a number of routes for registration depending on where the qualification in pharmacy was obtained.  The spouses of EU citizens wishing to be registered as pharmacists are entitled to be treated in the same way as a national of the host member state.  Under the PSI's registration routes if the spouse has an Irish or EU/EEA qualification in pharmacy then their registration is processed by way of the regulations for these routes.  If the spouse has an non-EU/EEA qualification which has been already been recognised by a Member State of the EU, the qualifications and experience gained in a Member State are examined by the PSI.  This is to allow the PSI, as required by the EU, to determine whether the qualifications held and training/professional experience undergone are equivalent to the standards required to practice pharmacy by national and EU law.  Finally, if the spouse, or any other person wishing to register in Ireland, regardless of their nationality, has a non-EU/EEA qualification which has not been recognised in any other Member State, they must apply for registration under the PSI's adjudication route.</p>
            <p eId="para_7296">The PSI has experienced difficulties in the operation of their adjudication route of registration for pharmacists trained outside of the EU/EEA area.  In order to address their difficulties, the Council of the PSI approved the undertaking of a review of its adjudicating committee procedures in October 2001.  The PSI submitted a proposal for amended regulations to my Department in March 2003.  However, the PSI's proposals for amended regulations are not possible under current pharmacy legislation.  The PSI suspended its adjudication route of registration in October 2001 and is unable, at this time, to consider any application for registration under this route.  The proposals in the new Pharmacy Bill dealing with registration will put in place a registration regime to allow for the recognition of qualifications in pharmacy, be they Irish, EU/EEA or non-EU/EEA.</p>

The repayment scheme was launched publicly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald on 14 August 2006.  A national advertising campaign and a helpline also commenced on this date.  The HSE and scheme administrator have sent out 22,000 application forms of which 11,500 have been returned.</p>
            <p eId="para_7330">It is anticipated that notification of the calculated amount of repayment due,  in the case of applications received in respect of the 11,000 claims which have been validated by the scheme administrator, will issue in early October.  Applicants will on receipt of these notifications have a period of 28 days in which to reject or appeal the calculated amount of repayment due prior to the issue of the money by the Health Service Executive.  Provision has been made for applications to be received up to 1 January 2008 and it is anticipated that all repayments will have been completed by this date, however if necessary the cut off date for receipt of applications can be extended.</p>

            <p eId="para_7351">In March 2006, I established a Working Group to examine the nature and extent of haemochromatosis in Ireland and to advise on the actions necessary to address the problems caused by it.</p>
            <p eId="para_7352">The Working Group presented its report to me in June 2006.  It makes a series of recommendations relating to the management and treatment of haemochromatosis.  The report has been circulated to the HSE and other relevant organisations for implementation.  A key recommendation was that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS) would commence venesection clinics, allowing it to retain and use the blood drawn from persons with haemochromatosis.  This has been agreed and the National Medical Director of the IBTS has informed the Irish Haemochromatosis Association that clinics will be set up in Dublin and probably also in Cork, early next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7353">Since the publication of the report there have been discussions with insurers to address anomalies in insurance cover.  The Irish Insurance Federation is assisting in whatever way it can and its Information Officer will deal with any  reports of alleged discriminatory treatment by insurers.  The report has created greater awareness of the key issues relating to the management of haemochromatosis.   I am confident that the various agencies will work with the Irish Haemochromatosis Association to implement  the recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_7358">I have met with representatives of BreastCheck and they are fully aware of my wish to have a quality assured programme rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible.  For this to happen, essential elements of the roll out must be in place including adequate staffing, effective training and quality assurance programmes.  I have made additional revenue funding of €2.3m available to BreastCheck to meet the additional costs of roll out.  I have also approved an additional 69 posts.  BreastCheck recently appointed Clinical Directors for the Southern and Western regions and the recruitment of Consultants and other staff is now underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_7359">BreastCheck also requires considerable capital investment in the construction of two new clinical units and in the provision of  five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  I have made available an additional €21m capital funding to BreastCheck for this purpose.  Demolition works at South Infirmary/Victoria University Hospital were completed this month.  The Department has issued approval to BreastCheck to award contracts for the construction of the static units at the South Infirmary/Victoria University Hospital, Cork and University College Hospital Galway.  BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of roll out to the Southern and Western regions will be met.</p>

         the statistics in relation to the incidence of Lyme disease here; her views on whether awareness of the fact that this disease can be transmitted to humans via tick bites needs to be increased and that it should be a notifiable disease; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_816">
            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_7390">Lyme Disease (also known as Lyme borelliosis) is an infection caused by a spiral shaped bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi that is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can sometimes be more severe.  Lyme Disease has been reported from North America, Europe, Australia, China and Japan.  They feed by biting and attaching to the skin and sucking blood, normally from animals such as sheep and deer.  Infected ticks are most likely to be encountered in heath land and lightly forested areas of North America and Northern Europe.  Ramblers, campers and those who work in such areas especially if they come into contact with large animals are at greatest risk of being bitten by ticks and of going on to develop disease.  Cases of Lyme Disease appear in Ireland every year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7391">Many infected people have no symptoms at all.  The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about three-quarters of infected people.  This red, raised skin rash develops between 3 days and a month after a tick bite and spreads outwards from the initial bite site.  This rash can last up to a month and be several inches in diameter.  People can also complain of 'flu-like symptoms such as headache, sore throat, neck stiffness, fever, muscle aches and general fatigue.  Occasionally, there may be more serious symptoms involving the nervous system, joints, the heart or other tissues.</p>
            <p eId="para_7392">Lyme disease is not a notifiable infectious disease in Ireland.  This means that there is no legal requirement on doctors to report cases to their local Director of Public Health, so this makes estimates of incidence difficult.</p>
            <p eId="para_7393">In Ireland, researchers have tried to determine levels of Lyme borreliosis; it has been estimated that there were about 30 human cases per year in the mid-1990s.  Data, however, from the National Virus Reference Laboratory which is responsible for undertaking testing for B. burgdorferi has confirmed that there were only 11 positive cases in 2003; these numbers have been steady at that level for the last couple of years.  There were, however, more than 1,000 requests for testing for B. burgdorferi in 2003.  Over the last several years, the NVRL confirms that virtually all positive cases were associated with travel in the US.  It is felt that there is some, unknown degree of underreporting and under diagnosis of this condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_7394">It would, therefore, appear on initial review, that despite confirmed Irish cases of Lyme borelliosis having been principally associated with travel to North America, there is the potential for individuals to be exposed to biting ticks in Ireland.  It would seem sensible for this reason, to recommend that simple, straightforward information should be made available that will assist those who may potentially be exposed (whether as a result of occupational or leisure activities) to take necessary precautions.  As a response to this in 2004, the Vectorborne Subcommittee of the Scientific Subcommittee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre's (HPSC) Scientific Advisory Subcommittee was established.  One of its terms of reference was to identify and determine the burden of certain significant vectorborne diseases in Ireland and to make recommendations in relation to the provision of advice and guidance.</p>
            <p eId="para_7395">As part of the initial risk assessment, the available information on Lyme disease was collated and reviewed.  As in common with many other countries, estimation of true levels of this condition is rather difficult.  What is apparent is that, in Ireland, a number of cases appear every year and a proportion of these are likely to have been acquired in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_7396">A fact sheet on Lyme Disease has been made available on the HPSC's website to provide members of the General Public and Media with advice on minimising the risk of Lyme Disease (additional incidence information appears here).  In addition, part of the work of the Vectorborne Subcommittee in the New Year will be the development of Clinical Guidance on the management of Lyme Disease and raising awareness of this condition among clinicians.</p>

            <p eId="para_7442">There is no legislation in Ireland governing the intervention in the natural process of creating human life; instead, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council.

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_7506">Temporary District Medical Officer posts were not superannuable.  In September 1999, following agreement between my Department and the IMO an ex-gratia payment of £1,000 (€1,270) was to be made to temporary District Medical Officers.  I understand that changes made on a retrospective basis in respect of persons who previously held temporary public service posts may, subject to specific criteria and conditions being met, allow such persons to superannuate such previous temporary service and subsequently gain entitlement to a pension.  Given that temporary District Medical Officers would have been employed by the former health boards I have asked the Health Service Executive to examine this issue in the context of the provisions governing retrospective action in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_7507">Temporary District Medical Officers who took up Fee-per-Item or Capitation contracts for service to provide general practitioner services under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme would come under the terms contained in those contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_7508">General Practitioners, including those who hold contracts to provide services to public patients under the terms of the GMS Scheme, work in the private sector as independent service providers.  General Practitioners are not employed by the State.  As such GPs in common with other professional groups are, in the first place, solely responsible for making provision for many aspects of their professional careers including their pension on retirement from practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_7509">Many GPs while operating as private practitioners also hold contracts for service under the GMS Scheme.  The vast majority of such GPs hold the GMS GP Capitation contract the terms of which reflect the agreed outcome of negotiations between my Department and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO).  This type of contract was first introduced in 1989.  Included in the GMS GP Capitation contract is a provision relating to a scheme of superannuation as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_7510">"A scheme of superannuation shall be established which shall be administered by the Irish Medical Organisation.  The Health Boards (now the HSE) shall pay into such a scheme a sum equivalent to 10% of total capitation fees payable to medical practitioners under the scheme.  In addition, each medical practitioner shall contribute 5%, which sum shall be deducted from the capitation payments due to the medical practitioner and shall be paid on his behalf and for his benefit into the aforementioned scheme by the Board."</p>
            <p eId="para_7511">In accordance with this contract provision the IMO appoint Trustees to administer the superannuation scheme which is known as the "GMS Superannuation Plan".  From October 2001 under the terms of the Plan members were allowed to make additional voluntary contributions giving members the opportunity to augment benefits accruing at retirement.  In 2004, the contribution made by the former health boards to the "GMS Superannuation Plan" amounted to over €16 million while in 2003 it was in excess of €15 million.  It will be noted that this was in addition to capitation payments and other fees paid to GPs under the GMS Scheme which totalled (excluding the superannuation contribution) over €290 million in 2004 for approx. 2,200 GPs and in excess of €271 million in 2003 for approx 2,180 GPs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7512">A small number of GPs hold Fee-per-Item GMS Scheme contracts with the HSE.  This contract for service was introduced in 1972 when the GMS Scheme was first established.  There are 17 GPs holding such contracts.  The Fee-per-Item GP contract was also agreed on foot of negotiations between the Department of Health and Children and the IMO.  It did not contain provision for a scheme of superannuation.  It fell to each GP to make arrangements in this respect as they felt appropriate.  It will be noted that in 1989, on the introduction of the GMS GP capitation contract, those GPs with Fee-per-Item contracts were given the option of taking up the former.</p>

         the reason a new physiotherapy training school was opened in the University of Limerick in 2002 with 25 places when graduates of existing schools were finding it difficult to find appropriate employment here; if, in view of the shortage of doctors, she will consider an upgrade course for physiotherapists to doctor, with free fees and grants in return for a commitment to work in the Irish health service for a specified number of years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_7516">In response to concerns regarding labour shortages, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions to 2015 in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  The report was published in 2001 and arising from its recommendations an additional physiotherapy course providing 25 places was established in the University of Limerick in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_7517">Responsibility for the management of human resource issues, including recruitment of staff, lies with the Health Service Executive (HSE) under the Health Act 2004.  I am advised by the HSE that in June 2006 its representatives, including Therapy Managers, visited all third level colleges providing therapy training courses to meet with potential graduates including physiotherapy.  A central employment applications system was set up and applications forwarded to each health region in line with the applicants first and second preferences.  A full review is now underway by the HSE to ascertain the employment status of the successful graduates and this will be completed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_7518">The Deputy may wish to note that the arrangements for undergraduate degree-level medical education are a matter, in the first instance, for the Minister for Education and Science.  In January 2006, the Government endorsed the introduction of a graduate entry stream to medicine (parallel to the existing CAO route) as proposed in the Report of the Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training (Fottrell Report).  The report was jointly published in February 2006 by the Department of Education and Science and my Department.  I understand that a "Call for Proposals" to institutions interested in providing graduate entry degree programmes is to be issued shortly by the Higher Education Authority.   The introduction of a graduate entry stream – the first intake to which is planned for 2007 – will provide opportunities for graduates (including physiotherapy graduates) to apply for admission to medical education degree programmes.</p>

Under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006, a living spouse or living child of a relevant person who has paid, on behalf of the relevant person, the whole or part of the recoverable health charges paid in respect of an individual can apply for a repayment.  In such instances where a partial or full payment was paid by a child or spouse on behalf of a fully eligible person who was wrongly charged and where there was adequate proof that such a payment was made that child or spouse is eligible for a repayment under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7537">I presume when referring to the repayment scheme fund, the Deputy means the donation fund which the Health Service Executive may  establish under Section 11 of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.  The purpose of the donation fund is to allow for patients or family members who are satisfied with the care which was provided for a patient's long term care and wish to surrender all or part of  a repayment to help those less fortunate.</p>
            <p eId="para_7538">Any donations made under this provision are completely voluntary.  The fund enables those due a repayment, or anyone who wishes to do so, to donate money which will be used specifically for improvements in the public health services for elderly persons and persons with disabilities, the costs of which are non-recurring.  All such donations will be exempt from capital acquisition tax and any probate tax liability.</p>

            <p eId="para_7571">The Census 2006 Preliminary Report  was published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in July of this year just three months after the Census was taken on the night of 23rd April, 2006.  This represents very timely access to the provisional results, and my Department uses this information for a wide variety of purposes to inform policy and planning and to evaluate population health.</p>
            <p eId="para_7572">It should be noted that Preliminary Census data are based on summaries returned by each of the 4,400 Census enumerators.  These figures provide basic counts by sex and area of residence and are subject to revision.  The full value of the Census will be realised when the final results by specific subject matter (e.g. age, marital status, occupation) begin to become available from April of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_7573">The principal value and use of the Preliminary Report is in indicating trends in both the growth of the population and key demographic characteristics since the last Census in 2002.  In addition, the new estimated population data allows more accurate and updated calculation of rates and trends in causes of mortality, in health conditions and in health determinants which are essential for needs assessment and in targeting and prioritising health promotion campaigns.</p>
            <p eId="para_7574">It should be noted that my Department relies on a wide range of CSO census, survey and registration data in order to carry out its work.  This includes, in particular, Vital Statistics registration data, Household Budget Survey (HBS) data, the new Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EUSILC), the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) in addition to a range of financial and national accounts data produced by the CSO.</p>

            <p eId="para_7595">On foot of the recommendations of the Pharmacy Review Group, my Department has commenced drafting new pharmacy legislation in two pharmacy Bills.  The Heads and General Scheme of a new pharmacy Bill have been approved by Cabinet and are currently with the Parliamentary Council's Office for drafting.  It is my intention, subject to Cabinet approval, that the new pharmacy Bill will be published and submitted to the Oireachtas in the Autumn.  The Bill will deal with the following matters:  firstly, changes to the governance of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland; secondly, provisions to update the registration process for pharmacists and introduce a registration system for pharmacies; thirdly, provisions for the introduction of a fitness to practise regime for pharmacists and pharmacy businesses; finally, miscellaneous provisions, including allowing for the removal of the derogation under Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC (the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU or EEA countries from owning, managing or supervising pharmacies that are less than 3 years old).</p>
            <p eId="para_7596">The second Bill will address the regulation of pharmacy and pharmacy services, including the definition of pharmacy services and of a community pharmacy, enhanced provisions for the inspection of pharmacies, and the provision for regulation of pharmacies for matters such as physical conditions, standards, record keeping and promotional activities.  It is also proposed to deal with general provisions relating to community pharmacy contracts for services, as well as the remaining recommendations of the Pharmacy Review Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_7597">The Government accepted the Review Group recommendation that there should be no beneficial ownership or business interest of any kind between prescribing and dispensing and, in regard to multi-GP practices with adjacent pharmacies, that contracted pharmacies and general practices should occupy discrete premises, with separate entrances.  I have agreed to consider the potential conflict of interest issues arising from the development of health centres with adjacent contracted pharmacies and this issue will be addressed in the second Bill in the light of that examination.  In the interim, my Department has advised the Health Service Executive to take due care in assessing pharmacy contract applications so that any commercial relationship between a pharmacy contractor and a health centre will not affect the proper provision of services as required under clauses 21, 22(3), 22(4) and 23 of the pharmacy contract, dealing with ownership of pharmacies and beneficial interest.  I have also written to the Medical Council in relation to this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_7598">The Deputy will note that the location of services is a land use planning issue and therefore a matter for the relevant planning authority.  I am not in a position to dictate the location of privately funded and owned pharmacies or GP practices, nor to restrict the awarding of State pharmacy contracts based on location.</p>

            <p eId="para_7606">On the 23rd September 2004, I signed Statutory Instrument No. 548 of 2004.

            <p eId="para_7607">On the 24th September 2004, I signed Statutory Instrument No. 549 of 2004.

            <p eId="para_7618">I brought proposals to Government on the National Cancer Control Strategy prior to its publication last June.  The Strategy encompasses all aspects of cancer, including prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, supportive and palliative care.  My objective is to develop an integrated cancer control programme based on:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7619">evidence of what works to prevent and treat cancer</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7620">standards that assure quality in all aspects of cancer control and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7621">fairness, so that all patients, irrespective of county, region or personal financial means, can be assured of the best cancer care.</p>
            <p eId="para_7622">Our efforts to prevent cancer will include societal and public policy responses to reduce smoking and alcohol misuse and improve diet and exercise.  I have written to the Minister for Finance on fiscal measures to reduce the consumption of tobacco.  Heads of a Bill are being prepared for consideration by Government to regulate the use of sunbeds, including prohibiting their use by those under 16.  I will shortly establish a National Cancer Screening Agency to amalgamate BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme (ICSP) to deliver both programmes nationally.  BreastCheck will commence national roll-out next year.  It is my goal to have the ICSP rolled out nationally by 2008, based on an affordable model.  The Agency will also advise in relation to a colorectal cancer screening programme, specifically on the population to be screened, at what intervals screening should take place, the type of test required and the requirements for a quality assured and well organised cost effective symptomatic service.</p>
            <p eId="para_7623">The Health Service Executive is establishing a National Cancer Control Programme.  A Programme Director, at national level, will be accountable for all HSE cancer control activities.  A single national budget for all cancer control activities will be developed.  The Programme will facilitate national standards for equity and access and will maximise ambulatory care.  The HSE will establish four Managed Cancer Control Networks to deliver the Programme.  Clinical leaders in oncology will be appointed to lead the delivery of quality multi-disciplinary care nationally and at network level.  I have established a National Quality Assurance Group for Symptomatic Breast Disease to develop an agreed set of guidance for the interdisciplinary management of breast cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_7624">My Department will, in consultation with the Interim Health Information and Quality Authority, further progress the Strategy recommendations on accreditation, quality guidelines, information and health technology assessment.

            <p eId="para_7674">The document referred to by the Deputy is a publication of the Stillorgan &amp; District Cancer Support Services.  It has as its central thesis that "although great advances have been made in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer, by far the greatest hope lies in its prevention."  Prevention and early detection is a key element of the Strategy for Cancer Control which I published last June.  My objective is to develop an integrated cancer control programme based on:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7675">evidence of what works to prevent and treat cancer</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7676">standards that assure quality in all aspects of cancer control and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7677">fairness, so that all patients, irrespective of county, region or personal financial means, can be assured of the best cancer care.</p>
            <p eId="para_7678">As many as one third of cancers could be prevented by public policy initiatives and the promotion of healthy lifestyles.  As I emphasised on publication of the Strategy, the Government has decided that it needs to put renewed emphasis on prevention as well as treatment.  The Strategy endorses the National Health Promotion Strategy which is being progressed by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_7679">Our efforts to prevent cancer will include societal and public policy responses to reduce smoking and alcohol misuse and improve diet and exercise.  I have written to the Minister for Finance on fiscal measures to reduce the consumption of tobacco.  Heads of a Bill are being prepared for consideration by Government to regulate the use of sunbeds, including prohibiting their use by those under 16.</p>
            <p eId="para_7680">Screening for certain types of cancer plays a crucial role in the detection of pre-cancerous and early disease, saving lives and reducing morbidity.  I will shortly establish a National Cancer Screening Agency to amalgamate BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme (ICSP) to deliver both programmes nationally.  BreastCheck will commence national roll-out next year.  It is my goal to have the ICSP rolled out nationally by 2008, based on an affordable model.  The Agency will also advise in relation to a colorectal cancer screening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7681">In parallel, my Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive in establishing a National Cancer Control Programme.  I intend to invest substantially in cancer control under this programme.</p>

Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_7720">I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.  My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service.  This process has been underway for some time and considerable progress has been made in talks on a settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_7721">My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_7723">In late 2005, the Health Service Executive (HSE), at my request, undertook a review of tertiary paediatric services.  McKinsey &amp; Company were engaged by the HSE and their report included a number of key recommendations:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7724">The population and projected demands in this country can support only one world class tertiary paediatric hospital</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7725">It should be in Dublin, and should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital (i.e. should be within a practical walking distance of such a hospital)</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7726">It should also provide all the secondary (i.e. less complex) hospital needs of children in the Greater Dublin area</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7727">These secondary services should be supported by strategically-located Urgent Care Services.</p>
            <p eId="para_7728">A joint HSE / Department of Health and Children Task Group was established in February 2006 to advise on the optimum location of the proposed new hospital.  The Task Group invited the six major adult academic hospitals (including The Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children's Hospital) to make submissions.  Each of the paediatric hospitals expressed strong support for the development of a single paediatric hospital, and emphasized the crucial need for decisions in relation to the new hospital to be taken urgently.  Consultant representatives reiterated their commitment to move to the new hospital regardless of its location.</p>
            <p eId="para_7729">Following extensive examination, discussion and consultation, the Task Group recommended that the new national tertiary paediatric hospital should be built on a site to be made available by the Mater Misericordiae Hospital.  The Task Group's report and its recommendations were endorsed by the Board of the HSE.  At its meeting on 8th June, the Government strongly endorsed the recommendation that the new National Paediatric Hospital be developed as an independent hospital on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.  The Government mandated the HSE to move forward with the development of the new hospital and its associated urgent care centres, and to explore any philanthropic proposals in relation to its development.  The governance arrangements that will arise in the context of amalgamation of the three children's hospitals will also be pursued, in particular the measures needed to ensure that the new hospital is multi-denominational and pluralist in character.</p>
            <p eId="para_7730">A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group has since been established to advance the development of the new Hospital.  Among the key items to be addressed are the definition of a high level framework brief for the new Hospital and the determination of the scope and location of the Urgent Care Service required to support the new hospital.  The Group is expected to enter into consultations with relevant stakeholders, which will include representatives of the National Children's Hospital.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_7735">I propose to take Questions Nos. 793 and 804 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7736">Let me say at the outset that there is no embargo on the recruitment of staff in the public health service.  Nor does my Department set employment quotas at national level for any grade in the public health service.  It is a matter for the Health Service Executive, as part of its management of its employment ceiling, to determine the appropriate staffing mix required to deliver its service plan priorities, including speech and language therapy services.  I have consistently emphasised the importance of prioritising the filling of front line vacancies in complying with approved employment levels.  I have also emphasised the need to achieve an  appropriate balance between clinical and non-clinical posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_7737">Approved employment levels for the health service have been adjusted since 2002 in line with Government policy on public sector employment and also to take account of specific policy measures aimed at increasing service levels.  My Department is currently in discussions with the Department of Finance and the Health Service Executive to agree revisions to the health service employment ceiling to take account of service developments, including disability services.</p>
            <p eId="para_7738">A priority for the HSE in 2006 is to increase service provision in the area of multi-disciplinary supports to meet obligations to children with developmental delay, in the home, in the community and in other appropriate settings.  The investment package will facilitate the recruitment of up to 200 extra therapists, particularly speech and language, occupational therapy and physiotherapy.  Due to the current limited supply of these grades, it is acknowledged that in the short term recruitment from overseas will be required.  The HSE has put in place a project plan for this.</p>
            <p eId="para_7739">In regard to the recruitment of speech and language therapists generally, the Deputies will be pleased to note that the Health Service Personnel Census shows a total of 596 wholetime equivalent (WTE) staff at end March, 2006.  This represents an increase of 315 WTE staff or 112% since end December, 1997.  The number of training places in speech and language therapy has increased by 300% since 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_7740">As the Deputy's question relates to service provision in County Kildare, which is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004, the parliamentary affairs division of the executive has been asked to respond directly to the Deputy in regard to the information sought.</p>

            <p eId="para_7770">In 2001, the year of the publication of Health Strategy, the average number of in-patient beds and day places available for treatment of patients in the 53 public acute hospitals was 12,145.  At the end of 2005, this figure had increased by 1204 to a total of 13,349, involving an additional 724 in-patient beds and 480 day places.  In addition, a further 450 acute beds/day places are in various stages of planning and development under the Health Service Executive's Capital Plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_7771">In July 2005, I announced an initiative to have private hospitals built on the campuses of public hospitals.  This is designed to enable up to 1,000 beds in public hospitals, which are currently used by private patients, to be re-designated for use by public patients.  The HSE is currently engaged in a procurement process with the private sector to build and operate  private hospitals on 10 public hospital sites.  All of these additional  in-patient beds/day places will mean that this Government's commitment in the Health Strategy to increase total acute hospital capacity is well on the way to completion.  In the light of the progress made to date and following discussions between the HSE and my Department, it has been decided to carry out a review of our acute hospital bed requirements up to the year 2020.</p>

Licences are granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act and are subject to stringent conditions.  As part of the licence application process each applicant must show why the experiment/procedure on living animals is essential and why the objective of the experiments cannot be achieved by the use of alternative techniques.  Justification for the choice of species is also required.  The application for a licence must be signed by two qualified persons of professorial standing, as specified in the Act, from a relevant scientific, medical or veterinary discipline verifying that the project is original or makes a relevant contribution to scientific knowledge and that the use of animals is essential as no alternative method is reasonably and practicably available.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
            <p eId="para_7825">As reported in the 2005 Annual Report of the Mental Health Commission, including the Report of the Inspector of Mental Health Services, the Mental Health Commission was alerted to issues in a number of services that were considered in need of immediate action.  The services concerned were provided with details of the Inspector's concerns and given recommendations on how these issues should be addressed.  The services were also informed that unannounced follow up visits would take place during the following three months.  The reports of the inspectorate on the service concerned were considered by the Mental Health Commission including the response of the service concerned and the Mental Health Commission then wrote to the individual service advising of what action should be taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_7826">The services were as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7827">[1) St. Mary's Hospital Castlebar:  The issues of concern were:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7828">(a) lack of adequate care planning for patients;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7829">(b) lack of key worker system;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7830">(c) absence of therapeutic activities for patients on the wards;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7831">(d) absence of assessment of patients prior to re-location to a new unit;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7832">(e) absence of psychiatric and medical review of patients on the ward.</p>
            <p eId="para_7833">Following correspondence with the service, the Mental Health Commission was informed that all patients had been assessed and reviewed with up-to-date care plans and a programme of activities had been established.  The three wards had been closed and patients had moved to a refurbished unit on the grounds of the hospital.  A patient in continuous seclusion had been transferred to specialist accommodation.  This report is available in book 5 Annual Report Mental Health Commission 2005.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7834">(2) St. Luke's Hospital, Clonmel:  The issues of concern were:-</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7835">(a) The locking of bedroom doors at night in one ward;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7836">(b) The practice of directly admitting patients to long-stay wards;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7837">(c) The inappropriate mix of patient groups on one ward;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7838">(d) The unacceptable physical environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_7839">Following the unannounced visit, senior management in St. Luke's Hospital reported that the practice of locking patients in their rooms at night had ceased.  The condition of one patient in seclusion had improved.  An audit of the practice of direct admissions to long-stay wards was ongoing and a five year development plan for the mental health services was being prepared.  This report is available page 143-144, Book 4, Health Service Executive South — Mental Health Commission Annual Report 2005.  The service continues to be monitored by the Mental Health Commission and a visit is planned for next month.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7840">(3) St. Loman's Hospital, Palmerstown, Dublin 20.  The concerns which centred on one unit, St. Joseph's, included:-</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7841">(a) Lack of consultant psychiatrist reviews of residents;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7842">(b) Lack of documented evidence of regular reviews in nursing care plans;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7843">(c) Discharged patients accommodated in a locked unit;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7844">(d) Residents' money being pooled and used for communal purposes without their consent.  Residents did not have access to their own money;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7845">(e) Poor physical upkeep and maintenance of the unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_7846">Since then, consultant psychiatrist reviews of residents were undertaken and care plans are being developed.  The practice of pooling residents' allowances on the unit had ceased.  The unit remained locked.  Following further contact, the Mental Health Commission was informed of plans to close the unit and provide the residents with more appropriate accommodation.  This is ongoing and is being monitored by the Mental Health Commission.  This report is available in Book 3, Health Service Executive Dublin Mid-Leinster, Mental Health Commission Annual Report 2005.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7847">(4) St. Finan's Hospital, Killarney.  The issues of concern included:-</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7848">(a) Locking of bedroom doors at night;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7849">(b) Absence of adequate care planning and key worker system;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7850">(c) Absence of psychiatric and medical review of patients;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7851">(d) The employment status of a patient participating in work opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_7852">In the most recent report from the service, it was stated that work was advancing on care planning and the key worker system.  Alternative facilities are being sourced to provide more appropriate accommodation.  Two patients who are locked in their bedrooms at night are reviewed regularly.  A further review by the Mental Health Commission is planned before year end.  This report is available in Book 4, Health Service Executive South, Annual Report Mental Health Commission 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_7853">The work carried out by the Inspector of Mental Health Services is vital to improving the standard and quality of services provided to people with mental illness.  Following concerns raised by the Inspector the services mentioned above have acted to improve conditions.  However, it is important that all services respond quickly to problems identified by the Inspector and that areas of concern are examined at a national level by the Health Service Executive with a view to improving all mental health services.</p>

            <p eId="para_7867">As aspects of the Deputy's question, concerning medical card and GP visit card numbers by county, relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) under the Health Act 2004 my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_7868">As the Deputy will be aware, a number of changes have been made to the medical card and GP visit card schemes since 2005.  The income guidelines used to assess eligibility for the medical and GP visit card have been increased by a cumulative 29%.  The assessment of means is now based on income after tax and PRSI and full account is taken of reasonable expenses in respect of rent/mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.  These changes have had the effect of further reducing the threshold at which a person would qualify for the medical card or the GP visit card.  In June 2006 I agreed with the HSE a further adjustment to  the income assessment guidelines used for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those used for medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_7869">These changes have meant that more individuals and families have become eligible, the assessment process has been made fairer and administrative arrangements have been simplified and streamlined.  A standard application form is now available, the HSE website allows prospective applicants to check their eligibility and the HSE has engaged in publicity and advertising campaigns to make people aware of the changes and to encourage applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_7870">The HSE has informed me that, in addition, a specific programme of work is being undertaken, focused on further modernisation of the administrative and operational arrangements for these and other related primary care schemes.  This is intended to make them more customer-friendly, administratively streamlined, fair, accountable and IT-enabled.  This programme of improvement is also focused on ensuring that the schemes are administered in a standardised way across the country.  An overall Steering Group has been established to oversee the programme, with regional groups to implement each aspect of the modernisation agenda in a standardised manner within their respective regions.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
         if she will reconsider the cut-off date of 9 December 1998 for families who are making claims under the national repayments scheme in respect of family members who are deceased; her views on whether such an arbitrary cut-off date is unfair and open to legal challenge; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_7874">The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 was signed by the President on 23 June 2006 and the legislative provisions of the Act came into effect on 30 June 2006.  The repayment scheme was launched publicly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald on 14 August 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_7875">Under the scheme all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons, who were wrongly charged and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.  The scheme does not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_7876">The decision to limit repayments to the estates of those who died in the six years prior to 9 December 2004 reflects the reference in the Supreme Court judgement to the statute of Limitations — "the state has available to it the Statute of Limitations i.e. a six year limit".  The Government has a responsibility to have regard to what the Supreme Court said, in order to limit the scale of total repayments which today's taxpayer would otherwise have to fund.  The scheme strikes a fair balance in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_7881">A number of innovative new sustainable energy programmes have already been launched as part of a €65 million initiative announced in the context of Budget 2006.  The programme is being rolled out over a five year period and provides funding for the domestic, commercial, services and industrial sectors as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7882">The €27 million "Greener Homes" domestic renewable heat grants programme is providing grants for householders for the purpose of installing renewable heating including wood biomass boilers and stoves, solar panels and heat pumps.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7883">The €22 million Bioheat grants programme provides grants for commercial scale wood biomass boilers aimed at the business and services sectors;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7885">A funding programme for the development of commercial biofuels facilities will be launched shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_7886">In addition to these funding measures, a number of other financial initiatives have been introduced:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7887">In July, I launched a five-year excise relief programme for biofuels, valued at over €200 million.  The programme builds on a pilot initiative rolled out in 2005, in which eight biofuels projects were granted excise relief over a two-year period.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7888">In June, I launched the Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff which is providing a fixed feed-in-tariff for renewable electricity over a fifteen year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_7889">In support of ongoing policy development we have published five major studies on renewable electricity, bio-energy, CHP, ocean energy and renewable energy.  The Bio-energy Ministerial Task Force will develop, by end-year a cohesive national bioenergy strategy.  Further policy initiatives are being considered in the context of these developments and the forthcoming Green Paper on Energy Policy.

            <p eId="para_7895">In general the protection of water quality in coastal bays is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Minister for Transport also has responsibilities relating to the prevention of pollution from shipping.</p>
            <p eId="para_7896">The Department has responsibility for the implementation of the EU Shellfish Waters Directive, which is concerned with the quality of shellfish waters and applies to those waters that have been designated by Member States as needing protection or improvement in order to support shellfish growth.

            <p eId="para_7897">The Department has established an inter-Departmental/Public Authority Committee with a view to monitoring the programmes established under the Regulations in respect of each designated area.

            <p eId="para_7900">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>
            <p eId="para_7901">It has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband, so the Department's Regional Broadband Programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high speed fibre based broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities.  These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) are open access fibre based trunk networks that will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7902">Twenty-seven MANs are now completed including the Wexford Town MAN.  The Department also administers a group broadband scheme, which is designed to promote the roll out of broadband access through the establishment of sustainable broadband services in towns, villages, rural hinterlands and under-served areas of larger towns on the basis of local and regional authority coordination and community driven initiatives. Under this scheme a broadband project was approved for South Wexford including Bridgetown, Kilmore, Kilmore Quay, Ballyhogue, Galbally and Bree, Co. Wexford.  These schemes are now operational and a broadband service is available.</p>
            <p eId="para_7903">The Department's website <i>www.broadband.gov.ie </i>gives full details of broadband availability in all areas, including ADSL, cable, fibre, satellite and fixed wireless.

            <p eId="para_7908">The Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the County and Group Broadband Scheme.

            <p eId="para_7913">It is now estimated that over 85% of the population currently has access to broadband services.  A lack of investment by the telecommunications sector in the necessary infrastructure has been an impediment to the delivery of competitive broadband services, primarily in the regions.

            <p eId="para_7917">Broadband subscriber numbers have increased hugely in the last two years.  Almost 140,000 new broadband subscribers were added in 2005, and a further 100,000 in the first half of 2006 alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_7918">The latest ComReg quarterly report states there are 372,000 broadband subscribers as of June 2006.  This is equivalent to 26.57% of all households.  A snapshot of the market conducted by ComReg in the middle of September put the total number of broadband subscribers at over 410,000 subscribers, or almost 30% of households.</p>
            <p eId="para_7919">The official Government target was to have 400,000 subscribers by end-2006.  This has been comfortably exceeded.  My challenge to industry is to reach 500,000 broadband subscribers by the middle of 2007.  Despite these successes there are some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.

            <p eId="para_8095">Responsibility for the regulation of gas tariffs lies with the Energy Regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The CER's legal remit regarding tariffs is set out in Section 23 (2) (b) (vii) of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act, 2002.  As the CER is legally independent in the performance of its functions, I have no function in the setting of gas tariffs.</p>
            <p eId="para_8096">I am, however, advised by the CER that the golden rate tariff is a special tariff that is specifically made available to customers over the age of 65.  One of the advantages of this tariff is that it does not include a standing charge, as is the case with other tariffs charged to customers (such as the standard rate tariff).</p>
            <p eId="para_8097">This tariff is more favourable, (less expensive) compared to other tariffs up to an annual consumption of 10,200 kWh.  Above this annual consumption, Bord Gáis Energy Supply (BGS) advise their customers to choose a more appropriate tariff based on the level of their consumption.  For example, elderly customers living with family may have a higher annual consumption and, therefore, would be advised to select a different type of tariff.</p>
            <p eId="para_8098">BGS has published a leaflet on gas tariffs called, ‘Your Tariff, Your Choice', which is available from BGS or on the BGS website <i>www.bordgaisenergysupply.ie</i>, in which the optimum rates for each customer are explained.</p>

          if further to his announcement of the greener home grant for people installing energy efficient systems in their homes that allowances would be made for people who had foresight and had already installed the energy efficient systems in their home before his announcement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_8100">One of the key objectives of the grant scheme is to stimulate the market for domestic renewable technologies and to encourage people to purchase and install renewable technologies, who might not otherwise have done so, because of associated capital costs.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any grants scheme, there has to be some reference date and start point and in the case of the Greener Homes scheme, as with other schemes of this nature, the relevant date is the date of launch of the scheme which was 27 March 2006.  The key determinant is that no work has been initiated prior to the launch date and also that no money has been paid prior to an application being approved by SEI.</p>
            <p eId="para_8101">The position in respect of eligibility for grant support is clear and is outlined in the range of documentation on the Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) website, in addition to the letter of offer which is issued to applicants. It is important, in the interests of transparency to apply the rules of the scheme in a uniform and consistent manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_8103">Petroleum resources within the national jurisdiction belong to the State.  Exploration for and extraction of these resources are regulated under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, and the Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration and Development 1992.  There are two mechanisms for issuing exploration licences.  The first applies to frontier areas which are opened from time to time through licensing rounds in which companies make competitive bids on the basis of exploration-based work programmes, the second applies to more accessible areas for which applications may be made at any time through an ‘open door' policy; the north east coast is in this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_8104">Exploration for and extraction of non-petroleum mineral resources are regulated under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999.  Exclusive prospecting licences are granted under the Acts which allow the holder to explore for specified minerals within a designated licence area.  Competitions are held four times a year for recently surrendered prospecting licence areas.  Applications can be made at any time for areas where licences have not been held recently or where no licence has been previously held.  No prospecting licences are held at present for offshore minerals.</p>
            <p eId="para_8105">The exclusive right to work all non-petroleum minerals within in the national jurisdiction, with a very small number of exceptions, is vested in the State.  All offshore minerals within the national jurisdiction are the property of the State.  In the event of a discovery of a commercial deposit, a prospecting licence holder may apply for a state mining lease to extract the minerals, terms for which are negotiated on a case-by-case basis, once the Minister is satisfied with the proposed development.</p>

            <p eId="para_8107">Expenditure on coast protection in the period 2000-05 was €35.508 million.  This year €3 million Exchequer funding is allocated for works at a number of locations around the coastline.  In addition, in August of this year, I secured an additional allocation of €1.718 million for urgent coastal protection projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_8108">In 2005 a new Coastal Development Measure, co-funded with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was introduced.  The jointly funded scheme will run from mid 2005 to mid 2007 and will facilitate coastal erosion works in CLÁR areas, including Gaeltacht areas and Islands.  Each Department will contribute €250,000 over the period of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_8109">The financial envelope including funding requirements for the Coastal Protection Measure under the NDP 2007-2013 is currently being formulated. Projects approved for funding in 2006 are listed in the following table:</p>

            <p eId="para_8273">An application from Dublin Port Company for approval under the Foreshore Acts for the proposed reclamation of an area of some 21 hectares of foreshore was made to the Department in March 2002. Since then, Departmental officials have held periodic discussions with Dublin Port Company's management regarding issues arising from the application.  This is a regular occurrence in most major foreshore applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_8274">The application is being considered in accordance with the appropriate procedures.  These include a process of public consultation in which it will be open to interested persons to make submissions on the proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_8275">The proposed development will also require planning permission before any determination can be made on the foreshore application.  Issues associated with ownership of the foreshore as well as environmental matters will form an important part of the Department's consideration to the proposal.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
            <p eId="para_8486">Funding of €3 million is available for the Coastal Protection Programme in 2006. An additional €1.718 million in new funding has been provided for a number of urgent coastal protection projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_8487">A Value for Money report in March 2002 highlighted the need for a more strategic focus in addressing the problem of coastal erosion in Ireland. In the light of this the Department initiated a coast protection strategy study in 2003.  The study is addressing the nature and extent of erosion and flooding at various locations and different types of coastline in Ireland and is seeking to identify the most effective means, technically, financially and environmentally, in responding to particular instances and types of erosion and flooding.  It is expected that when this study is completed a more targeted approach to programme delivery will result and will enable a greater level of efficiency to be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_8488">The projects approved under this year's Programme are co-funded by Local Authorities and in CLÁR areas by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Details of the funding allocated in recent months are set out hereunder.</p>

            <p eId="para_8650">On 23 July this year, I announced approval for €13.3 million in grant aid for 44 projects in the Border, Midland and Western (BMW) and South and East (S and E) Regions under the Aquaculture Development Measure of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.  These projects cover a wide range of activities such as the development of new species, expansion and modernisation of salmon and trout farms, together with expansion of shellfish farm facilities.  The €13.3 million grant aid will support a total investment of approximately €29 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_8651">Private projects are normally co-funded at a grant aid rate of up to 45%, however, also included in my announcement, was €2 million which had been allocated to 7 specific projects under the Technical Environment Support Programme (TESP), which is a once-off initiative, with grant aid of up to 65% of eligible expenditure on qualifying projects.  These projects are all aimed at achieving significant improvements in the environmental impact of the marine based salmonid sector, through improved levels of production efficiency.  TESP forms part of the measures being implemented to restructure the sector during the period of the minimum import price trade protection measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_8652">Under the Measure, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) and Údarás na Gaeltachta make public calls for projects on an annual basis. Projects that fulfil the eligibility criteria are identified by the agencies and prioritised on the basis of their contribution to the achievement of the measure objectives.  Those projects that meet the selection criteria are put forward by BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta, for approval by the Aquaculture Selection Boards for the BMW and S and E regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_8653">Details of the individual projects are in the following tables.</p>

            <p eId="para_8875">The competent authority for fisheries control in Ireland is the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources through its control services.  This work is carried out through close co-operation with the Irish Naval Service and Aer Corps.  The Naval Service, from its base at Haulbowline controls and monitors all fisheries activities within Ireland's EEZ.  Approximately 90% of naval time and resources is devoted to fisheries protection work.  This work is supported by control and surveillance activities carried out by the Aer Corps.  Sea-Fishery Protection Officers in the Department form the land-based control services for ports and other landing places.  The new Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 modernises, consolidates and updates all of Ireland's sea fisheries legislation.  It has in particular many features that strengthen Ireland's system of control and enforcement of the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy, including in particular the combating of illegal fishing.  The Act provides Sea-Fishery Protection Officers with various powers to enable them to provide effective control of fisheries and conduct effective investigations into fisheries cases.  Specific powers are provided related to the detention of fishing boats and persons onboard where illegal fishing is suspected, offences related to the obstruction and assault of Sea-Fisheries Protection Officers engaged in their lawful work.  The Act also lays down provisions for penalties and forfeitures in fisheries cases.  The Act also makes provision for the establishment of a new Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  The new Authority will come into being on 1 January 2007 and will oversee control and enforcement of fisheries legislation in Ireland.  At EU level, a new Maritime Control Agency is being set up to promote greater co-ordination and co-operation on control across the Union.  These measures are all designed to combat illegal fishing and it is the responsibility of each Member State with participants in the fishery concerned to ensure that their fishermen comply with the regulations.</p>

            <p eId="para_8877">There is a considerable body of legislation, both primary and secondary, relating to the illegal capture of fish from rivers.  This legislation is in place to conserve and protect our inland fisheries stocks.

Each year the Department provides substantial Exchequer funds to the fisheries boards to carry out their statutory functions, including the combating of illegal angling.</p>

            <p eId="para_8881">When the Department or the Naval Service detects illegal fishing activity, the case is referred to the Attorney General's Office for consideration and appropriate action, including prosecution when considered appropriate.  In relation to wide ranging allegations brought to the attention of the Ministers in the summer of 2004 and subsequent wide ranging allegations, taking account of the matters raised and the potential seriousness of the allegations, the matters were formally referred to An Garda Síochána for investigation.  Those investigations are ongoing and are solely a matter for An Garda Síochána and I have no role in these investigations.  Any findings of illegal landings determined in such investigations and reported to the Department will, in accordance with legal advice, be reported to the EU Commission.  Late last year the UK authorities advised that a quantity of mackerel amounting to over 40,000 tonnes had been determined as having been landed illegally in Scotland and not officially declared, by Irish-registered fishing boats.  The quantities related to landings over the period 2001 to 2005.  The UK authorities have the formal responsibility for informing the EU Commission in respect of landings into UK ports and have formally reported the quantity involved in respect of Irish registered vessels for 2005.  The UK authorities have not at this time formally reported data to the EU Commission for the years 2001 to 2004 but have indicated the quantities involved to the Commission and to the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_8882">Data on illegal landings detected by the Department's control staff and the Naval Service relates to individual cases and is presented to the Attorney General's Office for consideration in relation to possible subsequent legal proceedings.  Accordingly, I do not consider it advisable to make the data sought available at this time as it could impact on any prosecutions taken against those involved.  Any findings of illegal landings determined in investigations and reported to the Department will, in accordance with legal advice, be reported to the EU Commission, as required by EU legislation.  The Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, recently enacted by the Oireachtas, is intended to strengthen Ireland's capacity to provide a dissuasive code of deterrents and sanctions to address over-fishing and all illegal fishing activity.</p>

            <p eId="para_8884">The Department recognises the importance of accurate reporting of catch statistics.  With this in mind, the Department invested in a new computer system, IFIS, (The Integrated Fisheries Information System) which was introduced in early 2005.  This system provides a single centralised database containing all information in relation to the administration and enforcement of Sea Fisheries legislation which integrates the related business processes of Licensing, Registration and Sea Fisheries Control.  This system also enhances the ability of the Department to meet its obligations in relation to the provision of timely catch data to the European Commission under the Common Fisheries Policy.  Of course the primary source of catch data going into this new system is the fishing industry itself.  All fishing vessels over 10 metres in length are required to keep a logbook of fishing activities, the species caught, the quantities, the location caught and the fishing gear used.  This information is transferred from the logbook onto the IFIS system by the control authorities at the port.  Improvements in the recording of data in the logbook and the data capture process, together with an enhanced control and inspection regime supported by dedicated training programmes, will ensure that the catch data provided by Ireland meets the highest standards of accuracy and reliability, going forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_8886">My Department maintains a watching scientific brief on health issues relating to non-ionising radiation, including mobile telephony.  The Department's involvement in matters concerning the health effects of non-ionising radiation (transmissions), which includes radio frequency emissions from mobile phone base stations is guided by advice from national and international health authorities which include the World Health Organisation of the United Nations.  The limits for non-ionising radiation are global limits established internationally by the International Commission for Non Ionising Radiation Protection.  There is no scientific evidence to date that exposure up to these limits is damaging to health.  The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), conducts audit measurements to verify compliance with these limits.  My Department has been in contact with ComReg who instigated earlier measurements at the school in January 2006.  According to ComReg another set of measurements was undertaken recently inside the school grounds.  The report on these measurements is at present under review by ComReg.  I will ask my officials to liaise with ComReg and to make contact with the Deputy when the report is finalised.  The siting of individual mobile phone masts and panel antennae is a matter for the relevant planning authorities.  My Department has no function in the matter.  I acknowledge that real fears exist amongst certain parts of the community about the health impacts of these masts.  I am sympathetic and understanding of these fears and the concerns that underpin them.  However, I must point out that to date, there is no scientific medical evidence that mobile telephone masts, which include 3G mobile phone masts, operating within the internationally accepted guidelines, are injurious to health.</p>

            <p eId="para_8888">It is not necessary that I be directly informed of every incident of illegal fishing as, under the Fisheries Acts, responsibility for enforcement of inland fisheries legislation rests primarily with the Central and regional fisheries boards.  I was informed of the seizure of a significant quantity of untagged salmon in Kerry recently, which is being pursued by the South Western Regional Fisheries Board but I cannot comment further at this stage.  I am advised that the fisheries boards have in place sophisticated monitoring and enforcement programmes to identify out of season illegal fishing.  I am reluctant to provide any greater detail at the risk of compromising the enforcement effort.  The Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging scheme and associated regulations and bye-laws are in place to, <i>inter alia,</i> identify illegally caught salmon, eliminate sales outlets for such illegal fish and to improve traceability in the distribution chain.  The current mandatory application of carcass tags and logbooks assists in identifying illegally caught salmon.  It is important that all alleged incidents of illegal fishing are reported to the relevant regional fisheries board so that they can be properly investigated and prosecuted.</p>

            <p eId="para_8890">From 1 January 2003, EU Law requires that Member States have had to respect a strict entry-exit regime applying to the capacity of their fishing fleets, measured in terms of both tonnage and engine power.  This means that generally any entry of capacity into the Irish fishing fleet has to be compensated by the previous exit of the same amount of capacity at a ratio of 1:1.  Under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 an open and transparent regime governing the licensing and registration of fishing boats, in accordance with EU law, was put in place.  The details of the requirements are set out in Ministerial policy directives issued to the independent Licensing Authority for Sea-fishing Boats.</p>
            <p eId="para_8891">The Irish fishing fleet comprises five segments of which 2 are further sub-segmented.  An applicant for a sea-fishing boat licence for a particular segment or sub-segment may, subject to the conditions laid down in the policy directives, acquire replacement capacity, in terms of tonnage and engine power, for that segment or sub-segment from another person for the purpose of licensing and registration of the vessel.  Vessels that are being licensed and registered under the Scheme for the Licensing of Traditional Pot-fishing Boats in the Irish Inshore Fleet, did not have to provide replacement capacity.  The purpose of this scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, was to bring within the regulatory framework unlicensed and unregistered inshore fishermen active at the time who had traditionally owned a small fishing boat and had a record of active commercial pot-fishing.  A condition of the scheme was that the capacity of boats licensed and registered under the scheme is not eligible as replacement capacity.  The scheme is closed and any applications for sea-fishing boat licences for inshore vessels, since the closure of the scheme, can only be considered under the standard provisions of sea-fishing boat licensing.  I occasionally receive submissions from individuals regarding various aspects of the replacement capacity system, which may affect them.  I have no proposals at present to change the system.  In any case, any changes would have to be in accordance with EU and national law.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
            <p eId="para_8893">In 2002 the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources initiated a national coastal protection strategy study to review coastal protection generally, examine policy options and set out a basis for effective decision making in regard to resource allocation.  This study is currently in progress.  Attention is at present being focused on detailed studies in a pilot area of coast stretching from Killiney, Co. Dublin to Carnsore Point, Co. Wexford.  In the pilot area information is being assembled on the current and historic position of the coastline, the nature of the coast, its vulnerability to erosion and flooding and the nature of the hinterland in terms of economic, heritage and environmental assets.  The information is being collated on a geographic information system, GIS.  Areas at risk of tidal flooding in the pilot area are being delineated at two levels of probability.  An extreme flood outline is being determined for the combined storm surge and high tide event with a 0.1% annual exceedance probability.  Converted into a band on a digital terrain model, this will define the outer limit for damage estimates and planning guidance.  High tide, surge and wave inundation levels with an annual exceedance probability of 0.5% are being determined which will show on the GIS the indicative flood plain.</p>
            <p eId="para_8894">Very limited data is available on storm surges around the coast of Ireland so it is necessary to develop a hydrodynamic tidal model to simulate tides and surges from historical meteorological data.  Storm surge modelling is ongoing.  All events identified as extreme storm surges between 1956 and 2002 have been simulated and water levels have been extracted at locations in the Irish Sea along the pilot area coastline.  The effects of global warming on mean sea level rise and increased storminess around the Irish coast are being assessed and will be included in the outputs of the National Coastal Protection Strategy Study.  It is intended that following completion of the pilot study that the surge modelling and identification of areas at risk will be extended to the entire coastline of Ireland including Dublin.  Land use restrictions, if any, resulting from these studies are a matter for the relevant planning authority.  This Department will advise the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government on impacts and sensitivity of erosion and flood risk in relation to planning and development, including the provision of assistance as required in the development of guidelines and standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_8895">In 2003 this Department provided funding to Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council towards the cost of the Dublin Coastal Flooding Protection Project.  This project, which was initiated following the tidal flooding which occurred in Dublin in February 2002, is aimed primarily at addressing the risks from tidal flooding around the Dublin coastline and within the tidal reaches of a number of rivers and canals.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_8897">The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) is the statutory body responsible for the management of the radio spectrum in Ireland and as such, is required to investigate any interference with services, particularly where critical safety issues are concerned.  Spectrum management is designed to ensure that all licensed services can operate without interference.  The law in relation to broadcasting is set down in the 1988 Television and Radio Act.  Broadcasting in the FM, or other broadcasting bands, is subject to regulation by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) — the broadcasting content regulator.  In order to broadcast in the FM wavelength a licence is required and any churches transmitting or broadcasting services without a licence from the BCI would be in breach of the law.  The function of ComReg in relation to broadcasting is to manage the radio spectrum and in doing so to try to accommodate the BCI by making frequencies available to it in relation to the contracts it awards to new licensed broadcasters.  ComReg has no legal power to allow any person to broadcast in the absence of a sound contract with the BCI.</p>
            <p eId="para_8898">ComReg launched a licensing scheme in June of this year that allows community and religious organisations to transmit services and events, such as religious services, for the benefit of people in local communities throughout the country.  The spectrum allocated for the scheme is in a frequency band that will not cause interference to other services using spectrum, including emergency and aviation services.  The regulations governing the issue of these licences required my consent as Minister for Communications, under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926.  I understand from ComReg that they met with representatives of the Catholic Church earlier this year to explain the licensing scheme to them and that the Church representatives expressed satisfaction with the new arrangements.  I have asked ComReg to get in touch directly with the Deputy in relation to the technical issues raised in the Deputy's question.</p>

            <p eId="para_8900">The €27m Greener Homes Scheme provides grant aid for renewable heat technologies including wood biomass, solar panels and heat pumps. A further wood biomass programme, valued at €22 million, has been launched for the commercial heating sector.  The development of support strategies for oil seed as a renewable energy source have focussed to date on renewable transport fuels.  The biofuels excise scheme currently focused on the transport sector has the potential to offer significant opportunities for the development of pure plant oil growing and processing facilities in Ireland, and also provides economies of scale and commercial returns for processors.  In that context, the technical scope for promoting usage in the heating sector can be explored as part of our commitment to develop the full range of options to optimise the potential of the bioenergy resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_8903">I propose to take Questions Nos. 870 and 871 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8904">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the independent regulator.  The question of enabling telephone exchanges for broadband is an operational matter for Eircom in a fully liberalised market, and I do not have any function in the matter.  However, it has been clear for some time that the private sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband.  My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities.  These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.  Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity.  The second phase extends the programme to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_8905">My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the County and Group Broadband Scheme.  The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area.  To date, over 160 projects have been approved for funding under this Programme.  A joint industry/Government fund of €18 million has been established for the Broadband for Schools Programme to resource the provision of high speed broadband connectivity to all primary and post primary schools in the country by end Autumn 2006, at no cost to the schools themselves.  94% of schools have broadband installed to date; the aim is to complete the outstanding schools in the coming weeks.  However, I recognise that despite these successes there are some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  I am currently examining options to address the delivery of broadband services to these areas and I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_8918">The harbour at Greencastle is owned by Donegal County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development rests with the local authority in the first instance.  In 2006 the Department has allocated funding of €2.4 million towards the commencement of the first phase of a development project for Greencastle Harbour under the Fishery Harbours Development Programme.  Under that Programme the Department provides 75% funding and the Local Authority pays the balance of25%.  The proposed development at Greencastle has received full planning permission.  The first phase is the construction of a rock breakwater.  The second phase involves the construction of 100 metres of berthage for mussel dredger boats.  The third and final phase would be the construction of a 250m long deepwater pier.  The Department is currently awaiting confirmation from Donegal County Council that they will contribute the 25% funding to the development.  The question of providing further funding to the project in future years depends on the amount of Exchequer funding available for fishery harbours and overall national priorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_8920">Buncrana Harbour is owned by Donegal County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development rests with the local authority in the first instance.  Donegal County Council submitted an application to the Department for funding to construct a breakwater to prevent siltation at the ferry slipway and a proposed boat harbour south of the existing pier.  The proposed development would include an RNLI berth with 24 hour unrestricted tidal access in the boat harbour.  The estimated total cost of the project is €1.65 million.  In 2006 funding of €300,000 was approved to initiate the construction of the breakwater at Buncrana.  75% of this funding will be made available via a grant from the Department while Donegal County Council will provide the remaining 25%.  The Department gave approval in March 2004, subject to the resolution of an issue over rental charges, for a foreshore lease to allow construction of a marina and associated works at Buncrana and a foreshore licence to allow dredging to take place.  The finalisation of the lease and licence has been delayed, as the rental issue has not yet been resolved. Donegal County Council has been contacted about this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_8924">Some years ago concerns were communicated to the Department that parts of areas licensed for the bottom cultivation of mussels in Lough Swilly overlapped with wild-oyster beds in the Lough.  Arising from these concerns, a comprehensive survey of the wild-oyster beds in the Lough was carried out, in conjunction with wild fisheries interests.  The results of the survey indicated that there was a minor degree of overlap between oyster beds and the sites licensed for mussel cultivation.  In light of these results and following consultation with the licence holders, arrangements were made to have the mussel seed removed from the areas of overlap on a voluntary basis.  Any oysters retrieved during this process were re-laid.  An application from the wild-oyster association for a licence to cultivate oysters in the Lough is under consideration by the Department.  Officials of the Department have met representatives of the association and advised them as to the further information required to allow consideration of their application to be progressed.  Some of the additional information has been received and it is expected that the outstanding issues can be resolved without undue delay.</p>

            <p eId="para_8926">The Renewables Directive (2001/77/EC) obliges Ireland to develop and implement a programme capable of increasing the amount of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% of total consumption by 2010.  The target of 13.2% approximates to 1450 megawatts (MW) of installed generating capacity to be operational to the electricity network by 2010.  Currently there are over 860MW of renewable capacity connected to the national grid.  This consists of over 590MW of wind-powered plant, 236MW of hydro powered plant with the balance (circa 35MWs) made up of different biomass technologies.  Support programmes put in place by the Government have more than doubled the capacity of renewable energy powered electricity generating plants connected to the electricity network in the last two years.  Building on this progress I recently announced an ambitious programme to almost treble the contribution by renewable energy sources from 5.2% of gross electricity consumption in 2004, the last full year for which figures are available, to 15% by 2010.  The new target will require growth in the sector to more than double from the capacity currently connected to 1650 megawatts by 2010.  The additional new capacity required to achieve this target will be delivered by projects under the previous AER V and AER VI competitions and the new Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_8934">Earlier this year, I launched a new ocean energy strategy, which aims to put Ireland at the forefront of ocean energy development and position us to capitalise on this resource.  The strategy was developed by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and the Marine Institute.  As the first stage in implementing this strategy, we have recently upgraded the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre in UCC as well as opening an ocean energy test site a mile and a half off the coast of Spiddal, County Galway.  This 37-hectare site will be open to test prototype ocean energy devices.  The first wave energy device, WaveBob, has been deployed on the Spiddal site.  SEI and the Marine Institute are also currently supporting a number of other ocean energy research and development initiatives.  The second phase of the strategy will see the development of pre-commercial grid connected devices and provide for a grid connection to the Galway Bay test site.  Ireland has one of the most promising ocean energy resources in the world, and the ocean energy strategy aims to position Ireland to take full advantage of this resource in the future.  It is too early however to forecast the exact proportion of electricity demand which could be met from ocean energy by 2025 as this will depends on a variety of factors including the success of the RD&amp;D projects being brought forward under the strategy.</p>

The Embassy has, on several occasions, requested him to submit the official death certificate of his grandfather.  The Embassy has not yet received the death certificate.  When that document is submitted, the processing of the application can resume.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_8952">The Government has no information on the planning which preceded the Israeli military action in Lebanon, and I do not intend to speculate on the matter.  Deputies will be aware that the immediate cause of the conflict was an unprovoked attack by Hizbollah on Israeli territory on 12 July, and the killing and capture of a number of Israeli soldiers.  From the beginning, the Government called unambiguously for an immediate cessation of violence and the protection of civilian lives.  I fully acknowledged that Israel had a right to defend itself against attacks such as those launched by Hizbollah, but not at the expense of the rights, and the lives, of Lebanese civilians.  The Government's principal concern was with the effect of military actions on civilians, Israeli and Lebanese.  We were shocked at the high level of casualties among Lebanese civilians, unconnected with any attacks against Israel, and at the widespread destruction of vital civilian infrastructure.  We worked directly with the parties and with our partners in the EU and at the UN to achieve a ceasefire.  We availed of every opportunity to influence those most directly involved.  On 26 July, with my colleague the Minister of Defence, I called in the Ambassador of Israel to emphasise the strength of the Government's position following the deaths of four unarmed UN peacekeepers in Southern Lebanon.</p>
            <p eId="para_8953">I represented the Government's views strongly at two emergency meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council during August.  Ireland contributed to ensuring that the EU at our meeting on 1 August issued an unequivocal call for an immediate cessation of hostilities.  I warmly welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 on 11 August.  It created the basis on which the fighting was finally brought to a halt and it offers a path to a stable peace based on the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon.  Good progress is being made in its implementation.  The deployment of a strengthened UNIFIL force in Southern Lebanon, alongside units of the Lebanese Army, has ensured that the ceasefire has been maintained and that thousands of Lebanese citizens can return to their homes.  Further peacekeeping forces will arrive in Lebanon over the coming months.  The Government will shortly be in a position to make a decision on an Irish contribution to UNIFIL II.</p>
            <p eId="para_8954">With our partners in the EU, we will remain engaged in support of the reconstruction of Lebanon, and of a plan for a comprehensive settlement of the inter-related problems of the region.  The Government has also responded rapidly and effectively to the humanitarian needs of the Lebanese people.  During the crisis, we committed a total of €2 million in immediate emergency humanitarian assistance to Lebanon and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  We have also pledged a further €2 million for longer term reconstruction and assistance over the coming two years, in addition to the programmed bilateral assistance of over €4 million to Palestine in 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_8958">The Duty Officer services provided by the Passport Office were extended in June 1999 and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, David Andrews T.D., wrote to all members of the Oireachtas on 25 June of that year outlining the features of the new scheme.  The Department operates two services whereby passport facilities are provided outside of working hours, by the Passport Duty Officer Service in Dublin and Cork and by the Diplomatic Duty Officer Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_8959">The Passport Duty Officer Service is provided on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays year round, except on Christmas Day and New Years Day.  It operates from 9am to 6pm on Saturdays and from 9am to 2pm on Sundays and public holidays.  During the peak travel season, April to August inclusive, the service is extended in Dublin and operates from 6pm to 10pm on Fridays, 9am to 5pm on Saturdays and from 9am to 2pm on Sundays and public holidays.  The Passport Duty Officer provides full facilities to persons who have mislaid their passports, whose passports have been lost or stolen or who find at the last minute that they are out of date.</p>
            <p eId="para_8960">The Department's Diplomatic Duty Officer, who also has other duties, continues to attend to applications for passports outside these hours but only in genuine emergencies.  Genuine emergencies are (i) situations of genuine and substantial distress such as the death or funeral of a relative or a relative dying abroad; (ii) urgent business abroad, particularly where Ireland is a beneficiary; or (iii) marriage abroad or a couple going on honeymoon when one of them finds a passport to have been lost or stolen.  The Diplomatic Duty Officer is not authorised to issue passports in other circumstances.  For reasons to do with security and with the legal position of minors, the Diplomatic Duty officer is not authorised to issue passports to minors or first-time applicants outside of normal hours except in situations of genuine emergency as outlined above.</p>
            <p eId="para_8961">Since the introduction of the Passport Duty Officer Service, in excess of 7,000 passports have been issued through this service.  I wish to acknowledge the commitment and dedication of both the Passport office staff and the Diplomatic Duty Officers in providing this highly valued service to the travelling public.</p>

            <p eId="para_8963">Irish Aid enters into funding partnerships through a number of funding schemes with various types of organisations in the delivery of development programmes.  Any potential funding for a school in Ghana would be likely to be delivered through a Non Governmental Organisation or through an Irish Missionary Organisation.  Details of the relevant funding schemes operated by Irish Aid are available on the Irish Aid Website, <i>www.irishaid.gov.ie</i>.  In addition, Irish Aid also provides significant funding annually to the Irish Missionary Resource Service, IMRS, which in turn administers project and personnel funding schemes for Catholic missionaries worldwide.  This ensures that development programmes are planned, prioritised and managed by the missionaries themselves.  Applications for support of a development project should be made to the IMRS through the representative in Ireland of the missionary organisation making the application.  The IMRS’s website is <i>www.imrs.ie</i> and its address is St. Paul’s Retreat, Mount Argus, Kimmage Road Lr., Dublin 6W.

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_8965">The situations in the Middle East and in Sudan are at the top of the foreign policy agendas of Ireland nationally and of the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_8966">The conflict in Lebanon this summer, and the continuing crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, serve to underline that there is no military or unilateral solution to the inter-related problems of the Middle East.  It is the strong view of the Government, and of our partners in the European Union, that the underlying cause of the violence which has caused so much suffering to Lebanese, Israeli and Palestinian civilians in recent months is the absence of a credible process for a comprehensive settlement.  The most recent meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I attended in Brussels on 15 September, stated the strong view of the EU that lasting peace and security in the region can only be ensured by a comprehensive settlement with a negotiated two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at its core.</p>
            <p eId="para_8967">The Government has consistently been active directly with the parties, within the EU and at the UN in the promotion of a just, lasting and peaceful comprehensive settlement.  We have worked to ensure that the EU remains fully engaged in the process, with a clear and balanced message for all parties.  I attended two emergency meetings of the Council in Brussels during August, which were instrumental in ensuring the adoption of Security Council Resolution 1701, the achievement of a ceasefire in Lebanon and the deployment to Southern Lebanon of a strengthened UNIFIL mission, alongside units of the Lebanese Army.  I warmly welcome the progress which is being made in the implementation of Resolution 1701, which offers a path to a stable peace based on the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon.  The Government will work with our partners to ensure its full implementation. We are also actively considering an Irish contribution to the UNIFIL II mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_8968">The urgent need for progress towards a negotiated two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been at the heart of all my recent discussions at meetings of the Council and at the United Nations.  The situation in Gaza in particular is unsustainable.  The EU is determined to work with Israel and the Palestinians to revive a credible peace process, based on the essentials of the Quartet Roadmap.  Both parties must meet their obligations under the Roadmap and under international law.  We strongly support the courageous efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to create a Palestinian national unity Government which is committed to a two-State solution and reflects the principles outlined clearly by the international Quartet.  I have stated clearly the urgent need for progress towards a negotiated two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been at the heart of all my recent discussions at meetings of the Council and at the United Nations.  The situation in Gaza in particular is unsustainable.  The EU is determined to work with Israel and the Palestinians to revive a credible peace process, based on the essentials of the Quartet Roadmap.  Both parties must meet their obligations under the Roadmap and under international law.  We strongly support the courageous efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to create a Palestinian national unity Government which is committed to a two-State solution and reflects the principles outlined clearly by the international Quartet.  I have stated clearly that if he succeeds, the EU and the international community must be generous and creative in our response.  We are also working closely with the Israeli Government to encourage a more serious and open engagement with the Palestinians, starting with an early and substantive meeting between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas.  Israel must also end all activities, including the expansion of settlements and the construction of the separation barrier on occupied territory, which are contrary to international law and undermine the prospects for a viable two-State solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_8969">The immediate priority must be to end the security and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  This will require an end to violence from all sources, the release of the kidnapped Israeli soldier and the detained Palestinian legislators, and the re-opening of border crossings for people and for goods.  I believe that this can be achieved, through acts of political courage by the parties, and that a basis can be found for renewed negotiations towards the establishment of two viable, sovereign democratic states living together in peace and security.  The Government will continue to play an active role, in cooperation with its EU partners, in the search for such a settlement, which is vital for the future stability of the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_8970">The Government's overall approach to the Darfur crisis is set out in reply to Question No. 900.</p>
            <p eId="para_8971">The crisis has also affected Chad.  Over 250,000 refugees from Darfur have taken refuge there.  Since late 2005 both countries have traded accusations of support for each other's rebels.  An agreement to improve relations was signed in Tripoli on 8 February 2006, but there have been problems in implementation.  On 14 April 2006, Chad broke off diplomatic relations with Sudan, alleging that Khartoum had supported an unsuccessful attempt by rebel forces to overthrow President Deby.  On 14 June 2006, Sudan asked France to mediate with Chad and on 30 June Chad announced its readiness to hold talks with Sudan.  On 26 July 2006 both sides signed an agreement to stop hosting rebels on each other's territory and on 24 August Chad handed over to African Union officials five suspected rebels from the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) in Darfur, one of the groups which did not sign the May 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA). Diplomatic relations were restored and border crossings re-opened after the two Presidents met on 9 August in N'djamena.</p>
            <p eId="para_8972">At our meeting on 15 May 2006, EU Ministers for Foreign Affairs expressed concern about the instability on the Chad-Sudan border and its potential impact on the humanitarian situation of the population in both counties.  Sudan was reminded that any assistance to attempts to overthrow the Chadian Government by unconstitutional means is incompatible with the pursuit of a political solution to the Darfur conflict.  Both countries were urged to fully implement the February 2006 Tripoli Agreement, to put an end to any direct or indirect support to rebel groups in the other country and to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and on the basis of full respect for the territorial integrity of the other.  On 15 September 2006 the EU welcomed the recent indications of an improvement in the relations between Sudan and Chad.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_8981">I propose to take Questions Nos. 900, 902, 903 and 905 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8982">The Government is gravely concerned about the continuing humanitarian and political crisis in Darfur and is using all avenues to urge concerted international action to resolve the major humanitarian and political challenges which exist there.</p>
            <p eId="para_8983">Since the outbreak of violence in Darfur in 2003, Ireland has been providing extensive humanitarian assistance and support to the people of that region.  In April 2005, I visited Darfur and saw at first hand both the huge humanitarian challenges on the ground and the sterling work being delivered by Irish NGOs, including Concern, Goal and Trócaire.  On foot of my visit, I pledged €10 million in humanitarian aid to Sudan over two years.  This pledge was fully met already earlier this year. In total, since 2004, Ireland has provided over €11 million in emergency aid to Darfur, including food and shelter assistance to displaced populations across the region.  In response to the recent deterioration in the humanitarian situation, I have approved a further €1 million in humanitarian assistance for Sudan.</p>
            <p eId="para_8984">The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, visited Darfur last July to see conditions at first hand.  He met with the Sudanese Foreign Minister and impressed on him the need to improve security, to remove any restrictions impeding humanitarian operations in the region, and to allow the transition to a UN peacekeeping force.</p>
            <p eId="para_8985">On 31 August 2006, the UN Security Council decided that a UN peace-keeping mission should be sent to Darfur, with a strong mandate for the protection of civilians and provision of security for the delivery of humanitarian assistance.  The establishment of such a Force was originally called for by the African Union and is fully supported by them.  It is regrettable, and indeed unacceptable, that the Sudanese Government continues to oppose the deployment of this UN Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_8986">Until transition to a UN mission takes place, the force established by the African Union, AMIS, must be adequately supported politically, financially and technically by the international community.  I welcome the decision taken on 20 September 2006 by the African Union to extend the mandate of AMIS until 31 December 2006.  Ireland has contributed €3 million in support of the AMIS mission to date, including €1.5 million contributed last July to ensure that it has the necessary resources to fulfil its mandate through to the end of this year.  Total EU support to AMIS since 2004 amounts to over €413 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_8987">The priority now for the international community is to exert effective pressure on the Sudanese Government to accept the transition of AMIS into a UN force.  This is in Sudan's own best interests.  The people of Darfur must be properly protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_8988">The issue of Darfur is very high on the agenda of the United Nations and the EU, and the Government is actively participating in deliberations.  With our EU partners, we are also encouraging influential African countries and other States to convey similar strong messages to the authorities in Khartoum.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs again strongly impressed this on his Sudanese counterpart when they met yesterday in New York.</p>
            <p eId="para_8989">Ultimately, the conflict in Darfur requires a political solution.  The Darfur Peace Agreement provides a constructive and comprehensive basis for a lasting peaceful settlement in Darfur.  I would urge those parties which have not yet signed the Darfur Peace Agreement to do so as soon as possible and commit to its full implementation.</p>

            <p eId="para_8995">In light of the news that a coup was taking place in Bangkok on the evening of 19th September, contact was immediately established between the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Irish Embassy to Thailand (which is based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) and the Honorary Consuls in Bangkok and Phuket.</p>
            <p eId="para_8996">Initial reports to the Department suggested that the situation was calm and that there was no immediate threat to the safety of Irish citizens in the country.  Civil order did not break down and there was no overt public opposition to the military's actions, which took place without violence.  Bangkok Airport continued to function normally and the situation remained calm throughout Thailand.</p>
            <p eId="para_8997">Irish Embassies and Honorary Consulates in the region monitored the situation closely, reported back to the Department and were ready to offer all necessary consular assistance to our citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_8998">When the coup was unfolding and in its immediate aftermath, there were a number of calls to the Department, the Embassy and the Honorary Consulates from Irish visitors to Thailand, their relatives at home, and from Irish citizens who were planning to travel to Thailand. Callers were informed of the unfolding situation on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_8999">The Department's travel advice on the website was regularly updated so that Irish citizens could make informed decisions before travelling to Thailand, or on whether to leave Thailand.  The advice reflected a considered assessment of the risks involved and was based on the best information available to the Department from our missions in the region and from the foreign services of other countries.  The advice offered was to stay indoors to the extent possible; to exercise caution if travelling around Bangkok; to avoid any street demonstrations and Government buildings; and to monitor local announcements, including in regard to possible restrictions on movement.  The Department did not advise against travel to Thailand.</p>
            <p eId="para_9000">Our Embassy and our Honorary Consulates in Bangkok and Phuket also made contact with a number of Irish visitors on behalf of concerned relatives in Ireland.  No reports were received from other sources indicating that individual citizens required consular assistance.  The Department continues to monitor the situation in Thailand, and the Deputy can be assured that the Embassy and Consulates will continue to provide consular assistance should this prove necessary.  However, at this time, the situation remains calm and does not seem to be a particular cause of concern.  Any changes in the position will immediately be posted on the Department's website, <i>www.dfa.ie</i>.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_9006">Maintaining and strengthening links with Irish communities throughout the world is a key priority of my Department.  Officials in our diplomatic missions and in the Irish Abroad Unit are very active in this regard and work closely with Irish community organisations across a wide range of issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_9007">The Government's firm commitment to enhance support for our communities abroad is reflected in the very substantial level of funding now available for emigrant services.  In 2006, the unprecedented amount of €12 million has been secured for this purpose.  This figure follows on other large increases in recent years, so that funding is now twelve-times the sum that was available when this Government came to office in 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_9008">So far this year, I have been happy to announce grants exceeding €9 million.  Most of this funding is being distributed to Irish community organisations in Britain.  In July, I announced grants of €8 million to over 140 organisations throughout Britain that are engaged in a wide range of activities of benefit to our community there.</p>
            <p eId="para_9009">While the needs of the vulnerable members of our community in Britain remain a particular area of concern, I am pleased that increased funding has enabled us to support a much wider range of initiatives than was possible in the past.  Government funding is now supporting a number of capital projects, as well as initiatives that help to sustain Irish community networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_9010">The interests of the Irish in the United States remain an important priority for the Government.  The circumstances of the undocumented Irish, in particular, continue to concern us. In all of our dealings with key figures in the US Administration and Legislature, we emphasise our strong support for measures that would enable the undocumented Irish to regularise their status and have open to them a path to permanent residence.  The Government is working very closely with Irish community organisations that assist the Irish in the United States.  We are happy to support them in their important work and I have approved funding to them of over €1 million this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_9011">While in New York this week, I met with representatives of a number of these organisations, including the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, an organisation that is proving most effective in representing the views of the undocumented Irish, as well as with representatives of the Irish welfare and advisory organisations that assist our community there.</p>
            <p eId="para_9012">While most funding is directed to organisations in Britain and the United States, a number of organisations in Ireland that are engaged in activities of benefit to Irish people abroad have received financial support.  This year I have also approved funding for the first time to a number of Irish community organisations in Argentina.  I look forward to announcing further grants later in the year to Irish community groups in Australia, Canada and elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_9013">Another positive development this year has been the decision of the Government to widen the eligibility criteria of the Centenarian Award scheme such that all Irish citizens born in the island of Ireland who have reached 100 years of age, wherever they may reside, are now eligible to apply for the Bounty.  Since the Government's decision, I am pleased to note that over one hundred centenarians resident outside of the State have received the Award from the President.</p>

            <p eId="para_9017">The United Nations has the lead role in the search for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.  As a result of the rejection of the Annan Plan by the electorate of the Republic of Cyprus on 26 April 2004, the accession of a united Cyprus to the EU on 1 May 2004 was not possible.  Since 1 May 2004 the Republic of Cyprus has been a Member State of the EU but, in the absence of a comprehensive settlement, the application of the laws and regulations of the Union to the northern part of the island is suspended.</p>
            <p eId="para_9018">In a report earlier this year on Cyprus, Secretary General Annan emphasised the need for the parties to resume contacts and begin to think about how to re-engage in the search for a settlement.  On 6 July last the UN Under-Secretary General for Political Affairs, Dr. Ibrahim Gambari, met with President Tassos Papadopoulos of the Republic of Cyprus and Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat, representing northern Cyprus.  As a result of a request from USG Gambari, both leaders met directly on 8 July.  The outcome of the meeting was an agreement to establish two technical committees: one on issues affecting the daily lives of people, and one on issues of longer-term substance.  It is encouraging that some progress has been made in overcoming early obstacles encountered in the preliminary discussions on the establishment of the technical committees.  We remain hopeful that both sides can make further progress and that the technical committees will begin deliberations in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_9019">Ireland, in particular through our Embassy in Nicosia, will continue to encourage both sides to renew their commitment to the negotiating process and the achievement of the objective of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federal State through an honourable, balanced and durable settlement protecting and guaranteeing the basic interests and aspirations of all.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_9021">Within the EU and in the relevant international and regional organisations, Ireland actively promotes respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms worldwide. In this context, we monitor reports of abuses of religious freedom wherever they occur.</p>
            <p eId="para_9022">The UN Special Rapporteur on Religious Freedom or Belief, Ms Asma Jahangir, engages actively with a wide range of countries on incidents and governmental actions inconsistent with the provisions of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief and recommends remedial measures as appropriate.  Ireland expects each UN member state to fully cooperate with UN human rights mechanisms, including this Special Rapporteur.</p>
            <p eId="para_9023">The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the Government of Uzbekistan has yet to invite her to visit the country, despite her clear wish to do so.  I understand that she has also expressed concern about the requirement in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to register religious organisations, noting that registration should in no case be a precondition for practising one's religion.  In the case of Uzbekistan, the Special Rapporteur has also emphasised the need for its legislation and practice in this area to be in full conformity with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_9024">Ireland is very concerned about the general human rights situation in Uzbekistan.  We actively supported EU action, specifically the restrictive measures agreed by the Council last October, as a response to the killing of up to 500 demonstrators at Andijan in May 2005 and the Uzbek Government's handling of the aftermath.  The Council will be returning to this matter in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_9025">We also monitor developments in regard to the human rights situation in Kazakhstan.  Through its Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the EU is working to assist Kazakhstan on the path of economic and political reform, including the development of the institutions needed to ensure that human rights standards enshrined in legislation come to be implemented in practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_9026">Ireland also strongly supports the valuable work of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which includes the countries of Central Asia, in promoting tolerance, intercultural, inter-religious and inter-ethnic understanding.  OSCE Participating States committed themselves at the OSCE Ministerial in Ljubljana last December to continue to raise awareness and develop measures to counter prejudice, intolerance and discrimination, while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief. Kazakhstan hosted a major seminar on these issues earlier this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_9032">The Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary means of providing Government funding for sports facilities. Projects submitting an application to the programme must be directly related to the provision of sport and recreation facilities and be of a capital nature, which, for the purpose of the programme, is defined as:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9033">expenditure on the improvement or construction of an asset and includes any costs directly incurred in this process; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9034">purchase of permanently based sports equipment, i.e. it is securely housed, and will remain in use for 5 years or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_9035">The programme, however, does not assist in the purchase of sites, premises or personal equipment, such as sports kits, gloves, shoes/boots or personal protective clothing; nor does it assist in providing funding for administration or running costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_9036">Under the programme, funding is available to sports clubs (including boxing clubs), voluntary and community organisations and, in certain circumstances, schools and local authorities.  The programme is advertised on an annual basis.  All allocations under the 2006 sports capital programme have been made, but I intend to invite applications to the 2007 programme shortly and it will be open to the organisation(s) in question to submit an application for funding for equipment and/or facilities under that programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_9039">I propose to take Questions Nos. 914 and 916 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9040">The question of a compulsory purchase order is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant local authority.  I understand that the swimming pool in question was built, by a religious order and while privately owned and operated by them, has been open to the public.  I also understand that the pool received some financial support from Dublin City Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_9041">Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, my Department provides grant aid to local authorities towards the capital costs of a new or replacement public swimming pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool.  The Programme provides for a maximum grant level of 80% of eligible costs (90% in the case of disadvantaged areas) subject to a maximum of €3.8million.  Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, supported and submitted by the local authority.  Before supporting a project, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the proposal is viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and that the project when completed, would have a suitable level of public access.  Consequently, questions relating to the location or operation of a particular public swimming pool should be directed towards the relevant local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_9042">The priority under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by my Department and where the deadline for submission of applications was 31 July 2000, is to continue to support those projects remaining to be completed.  My Department is carrying out an Expenditure Review of the Programme.  On completion of this Review, which is currently being finalised, the question of re-opening the Programme can be considered.  If the Pool Programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities to submit applications under the terms that will apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_9043">I do not consider that this issue has any implications for the establishment of the London 2012 Olympics Task Force and my Department has no compulsory purchase powers.</p>

            <p eId="para_9045">No funding was allocated by my Department in 2006 for local horse shows or equestrian events.  The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary means of providing Government funding for sports facilities.  Projects submitting an application to the programme must be directly related to the provision of sport and recreational facilities and be of a capital nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_9046">The Irish Sports Council (ISC) which was set up as a statutory body in July 1999 with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards provides funding to 62 National Governing Bodies (NGBs) of sport under agreed funding conditions and with specific priorities in mind.  The relevant NGB in this case is the Equestrian Federation of Ireland which received an allocation of €933,105 from the ISC in the current financial year in respect of its high performance programmes and current costs.  The allocation of funding by the Federation to its affiliates is a matter for the body itself.</p>

            <p eId="para_9049">Under the terms of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, where a swimming pool project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, supported and submitted by the relevant local authority.  Before supporting such a project, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the proposal is viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and that the project, when completed, would have a satisfactory level of public access and that social inclusion aspects are addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_9050">In 2004, Galway County Council submitted a tender to my Department seeking grant aid under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme for a project promoted by a private sector interest to construct a leisure centre, including a swimming pool, on a council site different to that initially recommended in a Feasibility Report prepared by the Council in 1999.  The formal procedures under the programme are that Ministerial approval is required at each of the Preliminary and Contract Document stages, before tenders are invited for a project.  Notwithstanding the fact that Galway County Council pursued an alternative approach to the procurement of the facility, my Department indicated to the County Council that it would be prepared to examine a detailed proposal on its merits.  My Department's main concern in such cases is to ensure that the normal characteristics of a public swimming pool, such as public access and social inclusion considerations are adequately catered for.</p>
            <p eId="para_9051">Galway County Council has been in contact with my Department in order to progress the project and a formal detailed proposal, agreed between the Council and the promoter, was made by the Council in June 2006.  Given the need to protect the State's interest arising from any grant aid awarded under the programme, my Department is having the legal aspects involved examined at present in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's office.</p>
            <p eId="para_9052">On the general question of private sector involvement in the programme, it is a matter for local authorities to devise funding and operational arrangements, as they see fit, in relation to the provision of public swimming facilities in their areas.  Experience shows that there is some potential for private sector involvement in the provision and operation of public swimming pools and some local authorities are exploring various ways of involving the private sector in their projects.  From my Department's perspective, there is no objection to the involvement of the private sector in the provision and/or management of public swimming pools.  However, in order to qualify for grant assistance under the programme, local authorities must satisfy themselves and the Department that the project meets the generally accepted operational considerations of a public pool in terms of public availability, charges, access for disadvantaged etc.  This is normally achieved in consultation with the appropriate County or City Development Board.</p>

            <p eId="para_9054">Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) was established as the statutory body with responsibility for the horseracing industry under the Horse and Greyhound Act, 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_9055">HRI receives a guaranteed level of funding from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund which is based on accrued excise duty on off-course betting, subject to a minimum level based on the year 2000 level adjusted for inflation.  Any shortfall in the amount generated by the excise duty is made up by direct Exchequer subvention.  Horse Racing Ireland received €54.68m from the fund in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_9056">HRI ensures that facilities for the disabled are prioritised at all racecourses through the operations of capital and health and safety grants.  Horse Racing Ireland's capital grant support is directed at improving facilities in three principal areas within racecourses:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9057">1. Improving facilities for racegoers (Access, Egress, Car Parking, Viewing, Toilets, Bars, Restaurants, etc).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9058">2. Improving Facilities for industry personnel (Jockeys, Valets, Trainers, Stable Staff, Veterinary Surgeons, Medical and Security Personnel, Turf  Club officials, etc).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9059">3. Improving conditions for horses (Racing Surfaces, Fences, Walk Ways, Stables/Saddling Stalls/Wash Bays, Parade Rings, etc).</p>
            <p eId="para_9060">In area 1 HRI is conscious of the need to have facilities provided for people with disabilities and development plans of racecourses are examined closely to establish if such facilities are being provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_9061">Obviously HRI directly controls the quality of facilities being provided at its own racecourses, while all other racecourses seeking grant support are obliged to agree their development plans with HRI executives.  Thus, HRI can leverage the improvement in overall racecourse facilities for people with disabilities.  HRI provides significant funding to racecourses under its Health &amp; Safety grant programme and the improvement of facilities for people with disabilities qualifies for support under that programme.  Racecourses receive 60% grant aid for qualifying projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_9062">HRI recognises that provision of facilities for the disabled at racecourses is a work in progress, particularly as many older facilities are being replaced under the current Capital Development Programme.  It is HRI policy to advocate continuing improvement in that regard.  HRI has recently appointed the Automobile Association to design and implement a quality programme for racecourses and within that exercise they will have a full audit of the key areas of provision for people with disabilities.  The Racegoers Consultative Forum which was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 has recently published its report and it places the improvement of facilities for disabled racegoers among its key recommendations.  HRI has assured me that it is committed to working with racecourses to implement this recommendation, among others, of the Forum.</p>

            <p eId="para_9072">A total of €200.09 million has been allocated to 2,183 projects in sports capital grants in the past three years, i.e. 2004-2006 inclusive.  I announced provisional grant allocations under the 2006 sports capital programme for local projects on 6th June last and national, regional and municipal/multipurpose projects on 12th July.  A total of €75 million has been allocated under the programme in 2006 to 797 projects.  At present, 789 of those grants totalling €74.91 million are not fully drawn down.  Given the short time frame since the grants were announced the low level of draw down at this point would not be unusual and it will be well into 2007 before many of the organisations grant-aided will be in a position to complete their works or draw down their allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_9073">In 2005 a total of €63.24 million was allocated to 645 projects.  At present, €43.34 million of that funding has to be drawn down and no payment has been issued in respect of 416 of the projects grant-aided.  In 2004 a total of €61.75 million was allocated to 740 projects.  At present, €27.81 million of that funding has to be drawn down and no payment has been issued in respect of 223 of the projects grant-aided.  As a major part of the ongoing work of the sports unit in my Department, many of the outstanding grants referred to above are being progressed to the point where the final quarter of the year will see their partial or full payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_9074">I can confirm also that almost the entire annual provision for sports capital grants in my Department's subhead has been spent in each of the last three years, 2003-2005 with grant payments totalling €198.31 million in that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_9075">On the finalisation of the list of projects to be funded under the Programme grantees are informed in writing by my Department of the full range of requirements which must be met in order to draw down the grant.

            <p eId="para_9081">Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, there are four stages in the development of a swimming pool project.  These are, in order of progress, Feasibility Study/Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  My Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works (OPW), evaluate each stage and prior approval is required before local authorities can proceed from one stage to the next.  Grant aid is formally allocated when the tender for the project is approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_9082">On 20 July 2006, I approved the tender submitted by Kildare County Council for the proposed replacement swimming pool in Athy town.  At the same time, I approved the maximum grant of €3.8 million for the project.  These approvals permitted Kildare County Council to move to the construction phase and it is now a matter for the local authority to proceed with the project.</p>

In that context, Fáilte Ireland and my own Department have provided observations to the National Roads Authority, including observations in respect of the issue specifically raised in the Deputy's question.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_9107">ILO Convention No. 181 on Private Employment Agencies was adopted at the International Labour Conference in 1997 and came into force from 10 May 2000.  To date, the Convention has been ratified by only 20 Member States of the ILO.</p>
            <p eId="para_9108">Ireland only ratifies ILO Conventions where we can accept every single provision and where our legislation can be fully in conformity.  This also allows fully for proof of compliance.  The fact that Ireland has not ratified a particular Convention does not mean that we do not have in place effective and up-to-date legislation and enforcement mechanisms relating to the sector in question, i.e. such legislation tends to reflect an approach developed within a broader EU framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_9109">Ireland has not ratified ILO Convention No. 181 as some of its provisions, such as Articles 8 and 11, relating to conditions of employment for workers employed by private employment agencies, including migrant workers, were not compatible with the provisions of the existing Employment Agency Act 1971.  A Review of the 1971 Act has been well advanced as part of the Government's commitments under the last Social Partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_9110">Under the new Social Partnership agreement, Towards 2016, the parties have agreed on the need for the improved regulation of employment agencies and appropriate protection for agency workers.  It is intended that new legislation replacing the 1971 Act will be published before the end of 2006 reinforcing the existing system of regulation by requiring all employment agencies established and/or operating in the State to hold a licence and will set out the conditions for the granting of a licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_9111">The new legislation will also put in place a statutory Code of Practice covering the standards of behaviour for employment agencies. Compliance with the Code of Practice will be a condition of licensing.  The terms of the new legislation and Code are being developed in dialogue with the parties to the new Agreement and other relevant interests.  In preparing the new legislation and the Code of Practice, regard will be had to the provisions of ILO Convention No 181.</p>
            <p eId="para_9112">The proposed legislation will be considered by the Oireachtas and, if enacted, will allow the Government to decide if ratification of ILO Convention 181 is feasible and desirable.</p>

            <p eId="para_9161">The Small Business Forum, which I set up last year, and whose report I published in May, were asked by me to examine the overall current environment for conducting small business in Ireland and to advise on the adequacy and appropriateness of public policy responses in the context of that environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_9162">In carrying out their review the Forum sought public submissions on the problems facing small businesses generally and also organised a series of consultation meetings around the country with small business owners and managers.  In drawing up their final report they had regard to issues such as rising costs, tighter margins and the need for balanced local authority charges, and made recommendations accordingly.  In launching the report I indicated that I was accepting, generally, the Forum's recommendations in relation to the areas of responsibility of my own Department and that I would be pursuing implementation of the other recommendations with my colleagues in Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_9163">I have not, to date, received any request for a meeting from the National Federation of Retail Newsagents.  Neither am I aware of demands for a regulator in this sector nor am I clear about what such a proposal might entail.  However my view is that a regulator for newsagents is unlikely to be consistent with the principle of better regulation and would also be unlikely to have a positive impact on competition in the sector concerned.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_9165">Responsibility for the resolution of trade disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery to assist the dispute resolution process, which, in line with the general principles of industrial relations in Ireland, is voluntary in nature.  There are also statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary process in areas where collective bargaining does not operate effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_9166">In Article 40.6.1 of the Constitution, the State guarantees liberty for the exercise, subject to public order and morality, of the right of citizens to form associations and unions.  Accordingly, an employee has the constitutional right to join a trade union, but the constitutional freedom to associate guarantees employers the right to decide for themselves whether or not to recognise trade unions for collective bargaining purposes.  Primary responsibility for initiating the process of ensuring that an individual's constitutional rights are upheld and vindicated rests with the individual.</p>
            <p eId="para_9167">The courts have ruled that it is legitimate for a trade union to engage in industrial action in pursuit of union recognition, provided the normal requirements for industrial action (secret ballot, one week's notice etc.) are complied with.  Consequently, disputes about trade union recognition may be referred to the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 1990.</p>
            <p eId="para_9168">For situations where it is not the practice of an employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations and where the internal procedures normally used by the parties have failed to resolve a dispute, the parties may avail of procedures set out in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, as amended by the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, and supported by the Enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution.  Determinations by the Labour Court under this legislation may be enforced through the Circuit Court, but such determinations may not provide for collective bargaining.</p>
            <p eId="para_9169">The Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 contains a specific protection for employees as regards trade union membership or activity in certain situations.  Section 8 of the Act prohibits victimisation, i.e. the doing of any act (whether of commission or omission) that, on objective grounds, adversely affects the interests of the employee or his or her well-being.  Sections 9 and 10 of the Act provide for redress where victimisation is alleged. A Code of Practice on Victimisation (S.I. No. 139 of 2004) sets out the procedure an individual may utilise to enforce one's right not to be victimised.</p>
            <p eId="para_9170">In cases of unfair dismissal, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2001 offer protection to employees from being unfairly dismissed from their jobs by laying down criteria by which dismissals are judged to be unfair and by providing an adjudication system and redress for employees who have been found to have been unfairly dismissed.  The Acts do not normally apply to a person who has been in the continuous service of the employer for less than one year.  However, if the unfair dismissal results from trade union activity, then the requirement of one year's service does not apply.  A complainant may refer a case regarding unfair dismissal to a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_9230">There are no proposals to introduce an employer licensing system in the context of enhancements of the employment rights compliance framework.  However, new legislation will be published before the end of this year reinforcing the existing system of regulation of employment agencies by requiring all such agencies established and/or operating in Ireland to hold a licence.  In this regard, the legislation will set out the conditions for the granting of a licence and will also put in place a statutory Code of Practice covering standards of behaviour for employment agencies.  Compliance with the Code of Practice will be a condition of licensing.</p>
            <p eId="para_9231">As the Deputy may be aware, we have a comprehensive body of employment rights legislation.  The objectives of this legislation are to, among other matters, protect employees against arbitrary behaviour by employers, provide for the safety and health of workers and foster labour market harmony by promoting policies that minimise conflict and maximise fairness.  These provisions, which are administered by various State organisations and services including the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Labour Court, the Rights Commissioner Service and the Labour Inspectorate, apply to all persons employed on an employer-employee basis in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_9232">The Labour Inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers.  The Inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to other Irish workers.  Should evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation be found, the Inspectorate seeks redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</p>
            <p eId="para_9233">It should be noted also, that in many cases, Employment Rights Legislation has provisions whereby workers who believe that they have been denied their entitlements, or otherwise unfairly treated, can, as an alternative to dealing with the Labour Inspectorate, take the matter before a Commissioner in the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_9234">The Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, sets out a number of commitments with regard to employment standards and compliance including a commitment to establish an Office of the Director of Employment Rights Compliance.  The Office will be established through the enactment of primary legislation and will be led by a Director at senior management level.  While the Office will retain a presence in Dublin it is anticipated that there will be a regionalised structure with the headquarters located in Carlow.</p>
            <p eId="para_9235">The legislation establishing the new Office will also address a variety of issues in the area of Employment Rights Compliance including a move towards greater accessibility for employees to redress via the Rights Commissioner Services.  In that context it will be a matter for the new Director to develop a range of policies and procedures reflecting the changed landscape for employment rights enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_9236">Towards 2016 also provides for a trebling in the number of Labour Inspectors, greater coordination among organisations concerned with compliance, new requirements in respect of record keeping by employers, enhanced employment rights awareness activity, the introduction of a new and more user-friendly system of employment rights compliance, increased resourcing of the system and higher penalties for non-compliance with employment law.</p>

            <p eId="para_9249">My Department is currently drafting legislation to amend the Protection of Employment Act, 1977 to cover a number of matters, including the outcome of the Junk v Kuhnel case.  Full implementation of the mandatory European Court of Justice Decision of 27th January, 2005 in this case will therefore be provided for in the Heads of Bill for the proposed Protection of Employment Bill 2006, which will also deal with the proposed Redundancy Panel and Dismissals in Industrial Disputes, both matters stemming from the Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_9250">Under the forthcoming legislation, to which my Department is giving priority, it is proposed that notice of dismissal for redundancy cannot be given to any employees in a collective redundancy situation under Section 6 of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977 as amended by Section 5 of the Protection of Employment Order, 1996 during the 30 day period of consultation with employees representatives provided for in Section 9(3) of the Principal Act.  On 31st August, 2006, my Department formally notified the Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities DG of the European Commission of its intention to implement the ECJ Decision in the Junk v Kuhnel case by amending the Protection of Employment Act, 1977.</p>
            <p eId="para_9251">It might also be noted that the existing Section 16 of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977 already appears to cover the ECJ Decision to a certain extent by simply stating that "Nothing in this Act shall affect the right of any employee to a period of notice of dismissal or to any other entitlement under any other Act or under his contract of employment".  However, a measure of clarity in this matter would be desirable, given the fact that decisions of the European Court of Justice are mandatory in respect of Member States.  My Department, in the legislation currently being prepared, is endeavouring to ensure that clarity and to avoid any doubt in the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_9254">While decisions regarding where to locate, including what areas to visit are taken by investors, a central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development.  The National Spatial Strategy provides a framework for achievement of this goal through the prioritization of development and investment in the gateway and hub locations.  On this basis, IDA Ireland seeks to attract FDI into the gateways and hubs, as well as a small number of additional locations throughout the West, and particularly Mayo through the linked hubs of Ballina, Castlebar, and Westport.</p>

The Industrial Training agency FÁS has briefed all staff on the range of services available to them and many of them continue to participate in the various programmes run by the agency.  Since the announcement of the job losses, Enterprise Ireland has participated at a number of meetings with the company concerned, outlining the various types of assistance that are available.

            <p eId="para_9262">The organisation to which the Deputy refers was established under the aegis of the National Joint Industrial Council for the Electrical Contracting Industry.  While its main objective is to advise Electrical Contractors of their responsibilities under the Registered Employment Agreement (REA) for the Electrical Industry it also carries out inspections of Electrical Contractors in order to ensure compliance with the agreement.  While the organisation does not have statutory authority under employment rights legislation to undertake such inspections I understand that Electrical Contractors are in general willing to facilitate, and cooperate with, these arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_9263">The Labour Inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has statutory responsibility for monitoring certain employment conditions under a wide-ranging body of employment legislation.

            <p eId="para_9264">The enforcement of the provisions of a Registered Employment Agreement may also be effected through the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts.  A trade union, an association of employers or an individual employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a Registered Employment Agreement.  If, after investigating a complaint, the Court is satisfied that the employer is in breach of a Registered Employment Agreement it may by order direct compliance with the agreement.  Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.</p>
            <p eId="para_9265">Towards 2016, the partnership agreement for 2006-2015, provides for greater co-ordination between organisations concerned with employment rights compliance, with a view to realising the considerable potential for synergy that exists in this area.  In this regard the Office of the Director of Employment Rights Compliance (ODERC), which will be established on a statutory basis under legislation to be published in 2007, will develop an ongoing structured dialogue with all the parties to this Agreement, so that, building on close co-operation, a comprehensive and responsive system of compliance and enforcement can be developed.</p>

            <p eId="para_9273">I am aware of the ECJ ruling that the Deputy has referred to.  The September 12 decision from the ECJ confirms the earlier Opinion issued by the Court that the UK Controlled Foreign Companies (CFC) rules restrict the freedom of establishment principle and are only justified to the extent that they are applied to counter "wholly artificial arrangements".  Taxation is of course the responsibility of my colleague Mr. Brian Cowen TD, Minister for Finance, and I understand that officials in his Department are examining the longer-term implications of the judgement.</p>
            <p eId="para_9274">The business structures that multinational companies use to serve their markets from Ireland are legitimate and legal under European law.  Therefore in order to avail of our 12.5% Corporate Tax rate the taxpaying company must be trading and have real economic substance in Ireland.  The rate cannot be availed of by "brass plate" type operations, which are targeted by CFC legislation.  From an IDA perspective the decision has two positives: it clearly finds that the establishment of a subsidiary, in part, for tax reasons does not constitute an abuse of freedom of establishment; and it will discourage wholly artificial arrangements while encouraging locating economic value in Ireland.  IDA is only interested in attracting genuine economic activity to Ireland and therefore the ECJ decision is fully consistent with our existing policy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_9276">My Department has been making good progress in the relocation of 250 posts to Carlow under the Government's Decentralisation Programme.  The number of posts in Business Units decentralising to Carlow, as at 15th September, is 280.  Having regard to the agreed staffing protocols governing decentralisation, my Department has approached all General Service staff who expressed a first preference before 7th September 2004 i.e. "Priority Applications" for relocation to Carlow through the Central Application Facility, with good interest across all grades.</p>
            <p eId="para_9277">Officials in my Department have analysed the "Two to Ten" priority applicants — those who before the 7th September 2004 deadline identified Carlow as their 2nd or subsequent choice.  In addition, given that there still remains a deficit in some grades my Department has assessed the post September 2004 CAF applicants, in line with Department of Finance policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_9278">My Department currently has 102 Carlow-bound applicants assigned within the Department, with a further 76 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned to the Department.  It is hoped to have all decentralising posts filled in sufficient time to ensure that staff are adequately trained in advance of the move to Carlow.</p>
            <p eId="para_9279">With regard to the property side of the Department's move, the Office of Public Works completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre late last year.  On 31st May 2006, the OPW commenced the tendering process by seeking expressions of interest from developers in relation to the design, build, finance and maintenance of new office accommodation and car parking for the Department in Carlow.</p>
            <p eId="para_9280">On completion of this stage, a short-list of developers will be drawn up from whom tenders will be invited.  Following the tender evaluation process the preferred tenderer will be requested to seek suitable planning permission.  On obtaining this, the OPW will formally award the contract and construction will commence.  The OPW expect construction to begin late in 2007 and the construction phase may take up to 24 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_9281">In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, are actively exploring the option of an earlier move to Carlow, subject to securing high quality temporary accommodation.  This latter option could allow for the movement of approximately 80 decentralising staff to Carlow during 2007, on a voluntary basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_9286">Consumers enjoy certain statutory protections from the activities of unscrupulous traders.  The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 requires that in every contract for the supply of a service where the supplier is acting in the course of a business, the following terms are implied:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9287">that the supplier has the necessary skill to render the service,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9288">that he will supply the service with due skill, care and diligence,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9289">that, where materials are used, they be sound and reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are required, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9290">that, where goods are supplied under the contract, they will be of merchantable quality.</p>
            <p eId="para_9291">Accordingly where a trader or contractor does not have the necessary skill or does not carry out work with due care and diligence or does not carry out work in accordance with terms of the contract, a consumer may initiate proceedings against the trader on the basis of the above provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_9292">I agree with the Deputy that door to door traders should provide the fullest possible information in relation to their businesses to enable consumers to enforce their rights and where necessary pursue such traders for redress.  Under the European Communities (Cancellation of Contracts Negotiated Away from Business Premises) Regulations 1989 (known as the Doorstep Selling Regulations), contracts to supply goods or services which are negotiated away from a trader's business premises, including doorstep contracts, oblige traders to deliver to the consumer a notice in writing detailing certain information necessary to allow the consumer to exercise his statutory entitlement under the Regulations to cancel the contract within 7 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_9293">When launching the General Scheme of the Bill to establish the new National Consumer Agency last month, I announced my Department's intention to review all secondary consumer protection legislation.  I intend that in reviewing the Doorstep Selling Regulations to examine the possibility of expanding the information door to door traders are required to give to consumers under the Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_9294">The recently adopted European Directive concerning Unfair Business to Consumer Commercial Practices in the Internal Market contains a general prohibition on commercial practices that might be considered unfair, aggressive or misleading.  In particular Article 7(4) of the Directive provides that, where a trader invites a consumer to purchase a good or service, a failure on his part to provide a range of specified information to the consumer, including the trader's geographical address, is a misleading commercial practice which is prohibited under the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_9295">The Bill establishing the National Consumer Agency will also include provisions to transpose the Directive, including this important protection for consumers, into national law.  When enacted, the law will allow individual consumers or the new National Consumer Agency to seek a court injunction to prevent specific traders from engaging in such activities.  I am also aware of reported instances of some door to door traders engaging in acts of coercion and fraud against consumers, particularly vulnerable consumers.  It is important that all such instances are reported to the Garda who have successfully prosecuted such traders in the past.  It is my intention that the legislation establishing the new National Consumer Agency will include specific provisions enabling the Agency to share information in relation to suspected offences of the type referred to above with bodies such as the Garda.</p>
            <p eId="para_9296">I do not feel that introducing a form of registration for door to door traders would necessarily resolve the difficulties experienced by consumers at the hands of some of these traders.  Rather I consider that these difficulties can best be addressed by a combination of consumers themselves exercising due caution when considering engaging the services of a door to door trader together with the introduction and aggressive enforcement of the provisions of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive outlawing unfair and misleading trade practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_9297">Finally I would urge all consumers to exercise caution when entering into doorstep contracts and to fully acquaint themselves with their rights in such circumstances.  Any consumer who feels that he/she may have suffered at the hands of an unscrupulous trader should bring the matter to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs with a view to establishing their rights in the specific situation.</p>

         the steps his Department will take to off-set the major loss of industry in the South Kildare and Carlow region; the meetings he or his officials have had with the various companies involved in regard to seeking a solution to resolving the redundancies of those effected; the results of such meetings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_9320">I am very concerned about the job losses in the companies concerned and the impact on the workers, their families and the local communities.  Finding alternative employment for the workers is a priority for the State Development agencies and accordingly IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and FÁS will play their part in developing a way forward.  The role of the training agency FÁS is particularly important and, depending on the company concerned, FÁS either has been or will be actively engaged in providing a career guidance service and training for the employees effected.</p>
            <p eId="para_9321">To date, IDA Ireland has invested almost €11.5 million in developing the Carlow Business and Technology Park.  This includes a 17,000 sq. ft advance office building which was completed last November.  Discussions are on-going with a number of potential investors.  In June of this year, I announced that €300,000 had been approved for an expansion of Carlow Community Enterprise Centres Ltd.  Funding has also been provided for an Economic Promotion and Development Officer in Carlow.</p>
            <p eId="para_9322">As regards Kildare, a number of world class manufacturing companies have located there in recent years.  I am aware that there are 25 IDA supported companies in the county employing nearly 11,000 people.  Last October, I opened the first phase of a major new €40 million commercial business park in Athy which is having widespread positive implications for the development of Athy and the wider Kildare region.  This Athy Business Campus will extend to about 16 acres and is due for completion in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_9323">I am satisfied that the ongoing efforts of the Industrial Development agencies, including the County Enterprise Boards will continue to bring investment and job creation opportunities to the areas in question.</p>

Where a disqualified person makes this disclosure, it is available on the Register of Companies for public inspection.  Section 160 (1A) of the Companies Act 1990 (as inserted by section 42 of the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001) provides that where a person who is disqualified in another jurisdiction fails to disclose that disqualification, as required by Section 3A of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1982, that person shall be deemed to be disqualified in this jurisdiction.

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_9335">IDA Ireland is the Agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland, including its regions and areas.  The agency hosted 19 visits to Limerick and 6 visits to Clare since the beginning of 2006.  So far this year no visits have been hosted to North Tipperary.  Ultimately, decisions regarding where to locate, including what areas to visit as potential locations, are taken by investors.  As such it is not possible to predict with any degree of accuracy what further visits might take place to these counties during the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_9336">There are currently six IDA supported companies in North Tipperary, employing a total of 717 people.  The attractiveness of North Tipperary for inward investment has to be seen within a regional context, with the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) providing a framework for the achievement of this goal.  IDA Ireland's regional strategy reflects the NSS, with an emphasis on the gateway and hub locations.  IDA is committed to the development of North Tipperary and is actively promoting the County for FDI, as part of an integrated Mid West region.</p>
            <p eId="para_9337">IDA's strategy for the Mid West region and North Tipperary involves:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9338">Winning new FDI in innovation driven, high value, high skills sectors</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9339">Working with existing companies to help them expand their presence in Ireland by the addition of increased functions of scale, including, in particular, increased strategic functions</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9340">Pursuing balanced regional development</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9341">Facilitating the provision of tailored property solutions and the supporting infrastructure to meets the needs of inward investors.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9342">Working with local authorities and other partners to develop and strengthen the attractiveness of the region in an effort to help win new FDI.</p>
            <p eId="para_9343">In moving North Tipperary to a more knowledge based economy, IDA Ireland is partnering with educational institutions in the region, in particular UL, LIT and TI, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment in areas such as R&amp;D, corporate services, shared services, supply chain management, treasury management, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_9344">Responsibility for the provision of industrial property solutions within the Mid West region also lies with Shannon Development and IDA Ireland works closely with Shannon Development in the promotion and marketing of these tailored property solutions.  Initiatives undertaken by Shannon Development include the Development of the Tipperary Technology Park, which is an integral part of IDA's international marketing programme and will be pivotal to attracting new investors.  Shannon Development, in association with Local Authorities, is also spearheading the drive to bring high-internet access to the region.  Templemore, Nenagh and Roscrea have been scheduled as Priority Towns for Phase 2 of the Broadband roll-out programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9345">I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for North Tipperary and the Mid-West generally.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_1095">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_9347">The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational matter for the industrial development agencies and relevant County Enterprise Boards, and not one in which I have a direct role.  IDA Ireland continues to market South County Dublin, including Tallaght and its environs, as a potential location for new foreign direct investment (FDI), in order to secure new investment and additional jobs for the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_9348">IDA Ireland's strategy for the Dublin area is to attract and expand major FDI projects, moving up the value chain.  South County Dublin is well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment, with superb infrastructural facilities at Citywest and Grangecastle, and a supply of well educated labour from the third level Institute of Technology at Tallaght.  Both business parks, and the Institute of Technology are easily accessible to the population of Tallaght.</p>
            <p eId="para_9349">Companies present in the area such as Wyeth Biopharma and Takeda Pharma Ireland Ltd in the pharmaceuticals sector provide high value employment and act as excellent reference sellers for the area.  Planning Permission has recently been approved for an Advance Integrated Circuit Manufacturing and Research facility at Grangecastle.  This is the largest planning application to date in the State, and will be an invaluable tool for the future marketing of Grangecastle as a potential source of high quality and large-scale employment for the population of the environs, including Tallaght.</p>
            <p eId="para_9350">Enterprise Ireland works with companies in its portfolio to assist them to grow their sales and exports and improve innovation in order that they can compete on world markets.  The Agency is encouraging companies to adopt new technologies to add value to their products and services.  Since the beginning of 2003, Enterprise Ireland has approved over €8.5m and made payments of €7.2m in support of development projects for indigenous companies in South County Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_9351">Enterprise Ireland has provided funding for the development of Community Enterprise Centres in South Dublin such as Brookfield, Bolbrook and Killinarden.  These centres provide incubation space for start-ups and also provide ancillary services such as training, mentoring etc., to address the needs of local clients.  Enterprise Ireland also supports the development of business incubation workspace as part of its on-going commitment to fostering links between colleges and industry, and has approved funding for the development of incubation space at the Tallaght Institute of Technology.  It is anticipated that graduates from the college, or members of research teams based in the college, will be to the forefront in using the centre, and in creating new jobs, particularly in the high tech sectors.  The centre is almost finalised and is expected to be in operation in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_9352">In addition, the South Dublin County Enterprise Board (CEB) is proactively involved in the development of indigenous enterprise, and provides a source of support for small businesses in the region.  Since its inception, the Board has approved financial assistance of just over €3.4m to businesses based in Tallaght.  These grants and other financial supports have resulted in the creation and maintenance of 320 jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_9353">South Dublin CEB's 2006 budget allocation stands at over €1.1m, 16.5% higher than the allocation provided to the Board in 2005.  This increase enables the South Dublin Board to maximize entrepreneurial development in the micro-enterprise sector throughout the region, including the Tallaght area.  South Dublin CEB continues to assist micro-enterprises not just by direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters but also through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation and job creation.</p>

            <p eId="para_9374">If a recipient of a social welfare or Health Services Executive payment has exceptional heating costs due to ill health, infirmity or a medical condition which he/she is unable to meet out of household income, it is open to him/her to apply to the local community welfare officer for a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9375">In my reply to a previous question from the Deputy on 4 April 2006, I stated that the Mid Western Area of the Health Service Executive had advised that payment of a heating subsidy to the person concerned had been suspended from the end of February 2006 due to an increase in household means and that the application was under further review.</p>
            <p eId="para_9376">The Executive has advised that it was not in a position to reinstate payment of the heating supplement in this case as the changes to household composition resulted in an increase in overall household income and the person concerned had not provided sufficient documentation to indicate that exceptional heating costs had been incurred.  As an interim measure, pending the documentation being provided, the Executive issued the person with an exceptional needs payment of €200 in August 2006 as a contribution towards heating costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_9377">The Executive has further advised that it is open to the person concerned to contact the community welfare officer at any time to provide any additional information that would support his claim for a special heating supplement.</p>

I have been advised that it would not be possible to extend entitlement to free travel simply to Irish born people living abroad as to do so would be contrary to European legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality.

            <p eId="para_9431">Earlier this month the Government announced improvements in the household benefits package to protect recipients from the increased costs of gas and electricity.  As a result of these improvements, the present entitlement of 1,800 free units of electricity per annum will be increased to 2,400 free units per annum from 1 January 2007.  There will also be pro rata increases for customers who avail of the gas allowance and these will come into effect on 1 October 2006.  The allowances will continue to include payment of the standing charges.  I am confident that these increases will be of major benefit to these recipients.</p>

            <p eId="para_9433">The qualifying conditions for contributory old age pensions require a person to have paid at least 260 contributions at the appropriate rate, enter insurance 10 years before pension age and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their social insurance record from 1953 (when the unified system of social insurance came into effect) or the date of entry into insurance, if later.  A person's contribution record may also be averaged from 1979, but only to qualify for a full rate pension, which requires a yearly average of 48 contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_9434">Over the years a number of measures have been introduced to enable more people to qualify for contributory pensions.  These include a reduction in the average number of contributions required for a minimum payment from 20 to 10 and the introduction of a number of pro rata and special pensions to deal with perceived anomalies in the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_9435">The qualifying conditions for old age pension purposes were designed to ensure that those qualifying for payment have an adequate and sustained history of contributions to the social insurance fund over their working lives.  However, the system of averaging contributions can give rise to varying results, with people with the same total number of contributions receiving different rates of payment, or indeed failing to qualify for any payment, depending on when they commenced paying insurance.  People can have significant gaps in their social insurance records for a variety of reasons including years spent in education or caring, emigration, or periods where they were ineligible to contribute because of their income level or they were self-employed.</p>
            <p eId="para_9436">The Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the new social partnership agreement Towards 2016 with a view to developing a framework for future pensions policy.  The Green Paper will involve a comprehensive examination of the issues associated with our pensions system including those pertaining to social welfare pensions.  The operation of the average contributions test and other issues in relation to social welfare pensions will be considered in the context of the Green Paper and the associated consultation process.</p>

            <p eId="para_9439">There is a general rule in the social welfare code that a person who is entitled to more than one income maintenance payment at any one time may only receive one of these payments.  However, there are some exceptions to this rule which includes the treatment of persons in receipt of Survivor's Pension who, if they have sufficient PRSI contributions, may concurrently receive half-rate Disability Benefit up to a maximum period of 390 days.  The person in question did concurrently receive Survivor's Pension with half-rate Disability Benefit for the maximum period.</p>
            <p eId="para_9440">The person is not qualified for Invalidity Pension, a payment for people who are deemed to be permanently incapable of work, based on the required number of paid or credited PRSI contributions.  However, as there is a gap in medical certification for particular periods, the person may be entitled to receive credited PRSI contributions.  In order to progress this aspect, the person has been notified accordingly and asked to submit necessary medical evidence for the relevant periods.</p>
            <p eId="para_9441">Qualification for Invalidity Pension may, depending on the person's circumstances, be more advantageous as it would also allow qualification for receipt of the household benefits package (Electricity/Gas Allowance, the Telephone Allowance and the Free Television License) which is not generally available to recipients of Survivor's Pension until after age 66.

            <p eId="para_9456">I propose to take Questions Nos. 982 to 984, inclusive, and 988 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9457">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme, BSCFA, operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  The BSCFA scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra clothing and footwear costs when their children start school each autumn.  The allowance is intended as a contribution towards meeting the cost of school clothing and footwear.  It is not intended to meet the full cost and it is not intended to meet school book costs.  The Department of Education and Science operate a book grant scheme for primary and secondary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_9458">A person may qualify for payment of back to school clothing and footwear allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.  Family Income Supplement is a qualifying payment for back to school clothing and footwear purposes.  People in receipt of FIS qualify subject to the standard means test and any income received by an applicant in the form of family income supplement is not assessable.</p>
            <p eId="para_9459">Budget 2006 provided for a number of improvements to the scheme.  These include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9460">an increase of €40 in the rate payable which now means now means that from June 2006, an allowance of €120 is payable in respect of qualified children aged from 2 to 11 years, or €190 in respect of qualified children aged from 12 to 22 years.  This represents an increase of 50% and 26% respectively over the amount paid lastyear.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9461">Extension of entitlement to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance to recipients of guardian's (formerly orphan's) payments for the first time.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9462">an increase in the additional income disregard for entitlement to the scheme from €50 to €100.  The new income limits for the BSCFA scheme for 2006 are based on the maximum rate of state pension (contributory) (under 80) plus €100 in the case of married and cohabiting couples; and the maximum rate of widow's/widower's contributory pension (under 80) plus €100 for lone parents, plus child dependant allowance in each case.  This means that the income limits for a couple with one child is €441.40 per week while for a lone parent with one child it is €314.90.</p>
            <p eId="para_9463">It is estimated that some 78,000 families will benefit under the scheme this year at a cost of €25m.</p>
            <p eId="para_9464">The Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive which administers the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on behalf of my Department may make exceptional needs payments to help meet an essential once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  This exceptional needs payment is made solely at the discretion of the community welfare officer and is only made where exceptional circumstances exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_9465">I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain.  I am satisfied that the improvements to the scheme for this year provide a major boost to meeting the financial costs of clothing and footwear associated with return to school for those who most need assistance.  While further improvements to the scheme, including automatic entitlement for those getting family income supplement, would need to be considered in the context of the Budget and in the light of resources available to me for improvements in social welfare payments generally, I intend to keep the scheme under review and to explore how it can be best targeted in the end to support those who most need it.</p>

          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_1118">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_9551">I propose to take Questions Nos. 991 to 996, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9552">The decision to transfer certain functions from the Health Service Executive (HSE) to my Department follows on from recommendations made by the <i>Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service</i> in its report.  The Commission noted that, over the years, the health system had been assigned responsibility for a number of activities that might be regarded as non-core in the context of a health service.  In view of the range of challenges facing the health sector, it recommended that the Government consider assigning such non-core activities currently undertaken by agencies within the health service to other bodies.  The objective is to locate these functions more appropriately and allow the HSE to concentrate on its core health functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_9553">The decision does not present a clash of cultures between this Department and the Community Welfare Service.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive on my behalf.  The scheme is provided for in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.  That legislation currently provides that the scheme is administered by the Health Service Executive, under my general direction and control.  Indeed, the positive attributes of the service, to which the Deputy refers, reflect the values and objectives that I and my predecessors have established over the years as part of the general direction afforded to the Community Welfare Service.  This has enabled the Community Welfare Service to play a vital role within the overall social welfare system.  The existing mechanisms of delivery allow the service to be responsive, flexible and outcome focused.  These are attributes for which there will be a continuing need into the future.  I can assure the Deputy that the new arrangements will maintain and where possible, enhance the service in those respects.  The initiative also involves major organisational and human resource challenges for my Department and for the Community Welfare Service.  A working group comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive, has been established to progress its implementation.  The approach includes a consultative process which will involve all relevant stakeholders including the various unions representing staff interests both in my own Department and in the Community Welfare Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_9554">The implementation process will also include consideration of the legislative changes and, in that regard, I will consider any recommendations that may be made for strengthening the legislation with a view to improving the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_9555">As stated, the administration of the scheme by the Health Service Executive currently is subject to my general direction and control and is delivered in accordance with guidelines and circulars issued by my Department.  The Executive avails of advice and guidance from my Department but neither I nor my Department has any function in relation to decisions on individual claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_9556">My Department operates certain control measures across all its schemes where payments exceed specified amounts.  Where supplementary welfare allowance payments exceed the specified amount a superintendent community welfare officer is required to counter-sanction the payment.  If this sanction is not received within a specified period, normally 3 weeks, the payment is cancelled and a cheque will not issue.  I understand that the incidence of this arising is minimal.</p>

            <p eId="para_9558">The arrangements I have outlined are purely an administrative control function.  Decisions regarding entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance rest solely with the Health Service Executive and neither I nor my officials have any role in this matter.</p>

During the implementation programme, my officials will be available to meet the relevant unions and other shareholders.  I will continue to give a high priority to supporting the continued delivery of the high standard of service currently provided by staff in the Community Welfare Service.</p>

A detailed breakdown of this overpayment was sent to the Deputy when he raised this question originally in July 2006 along with a letter outlining the facts of the case.

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_9571">I propose to take Questions Nos. 999 to 1001, inclusive, 1018 and 1029 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9572">The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.</p>
            <p eId="para_9573">Some 264,400 people (145,800 with basic fuel allowance and 118,600 with smokeless fuel supplement) benefited from the scheme in 2005 at an annual cost of €85.4m.  It is estimated that some 274,000 people (151,000 with basic fuel allowance and 123,000 with smokeless fuel supplement) will benefit in 2006 at an estimated annual cost €125.1m.</p>
            <p eId="para_9574">In addition to the fuel allowance, over 320,000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of €109 million in 2005.  As currently structured, these allowances are linked to unit energy consumption, so that the people concerned are protected against unit price increases in electricity or gas.  As recently announced, free electricity units will be increased from 1,800 to 2,400 per annum with effect from 1 January 2007 with pro rata increases for those customers getting gas allowance from 1 October 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_9575">People who have exceptional heating costs, by virtue of a particular infirmity or medical condition which they are unable to meet out of household income, may apply to their local community welfare officer for a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9576">The cost of the fuel allowance scheme annually for the past 5 years has increased from €61m in 2001 to €85m in 2005. Details are set out in the table below.</p>
            <p eId="para_9577">Eligibility to the fuel allowance scheme is subject to means and other conditions.  The main conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, must satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or with a qualifying dependant.</p>
            <p eId="para_9578">People who already qualify for means-tested pensions or allowances such as old age (non-contributory) pension, long-term unemployment assistance or one-parent family payment do not have to undergo a further means test to qualify for fuel allowance.  The majority of people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_9579">In the case of contributory pensions such as old age (contributory) pension, retirement pension and invalidity pensions, which are not means tested, a person may have a combined household income of up to €51 per week, or savings/investments of up to €46,000, over and above the maximum old age (contributory) pension rate and still qualify for fuel allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_9580">The fuel allowance income limits increase each season in line with the increases in the old age (contributory) pension rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_9581">Any changes to the Fuel Allowance Scheme would have cost implications.  Changes would have to be considered in the context of the Budget and in the light of the resources available for improvements in social welfare generally.  It is estimated that abolishing the means test could more than double the cost of the scheme, while abolishing the means test for people aged 80 or more would cost an additional €23m perannum.</p>

            <p eId="para_9607">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1004  to 1007, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9608">There are currently 28 persons from Co. Mayo and adjoining counties awaiting an oral hearing of their appeal in hearing centres located in Co. Mayo.  The number of oral hearings held nationally each month in 2005 and in 2006 (to the end of August) is set out on the following table.  There are no specific figures available as to the costs of appeals determined by way of oral hearings.  Statistics are not maintained on the number of oral hearings held  for each county, or the average waiting times for oral hearings scheduled for appellants on a county basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_9609">The average length of time to deal with all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of an oral hearing) in 2005 was 20 weeks.  If allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time falls to 13 weeks.  Oral hearings are granted at the discretion of the Appeals Officer usually in circumstances where there is a conflict in the evidence presented by both parties or where an oral hearing is requested by the appellant in order to present his or her case.  Given the logistics involved in organising oral hearings, the average length of time is increased by about 8 weeks where an oral hearing is involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_9610">The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by my Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examinations by the Department's Medical Assessors in certain sickness related cases and the holding of oral hearings which are currently afforded in two out of every three cases determined by Appeals Officers.  Circumstances can arise, normally outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which can have the effect of unduly prolonging the time taken to process appeals.  For example, delays can occur where the appellant furnishes new evidence which requires investigation at a late stage in the proceedings or where an adjournment of an oral hearing may be sought by the appellant or his or her representatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_9611">The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration.  While improving processing times remains a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, it is necessary at all times to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</p>

        <b>Mr. O’Shea</b>
         asked the

         the progress which has been made in the case of a spouse in receipt of carer’s allowance who is also the adult dependant of the other spouse who is in receipt of old age contributory pension to allow for both carer’s allowance and old age pension adult dependant payment to be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_9652">The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_9653">The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual.  This ensures that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one person.  Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</p>
            <p eId="para_9654">In Budget 2006, I provided for a significant increase in the rate of carer's allowance.  From January this year, the rate of carer's allowance increased to €200 per week for carers aged 66 years and over.  This rate of payment may be higher in many instances than the rate of old age pension or qualified adult allowance payable to a person.  Such a person who is providing full time care and attention to a person who requires such care may be entitled to receive this higher rate of carer's allowance. I would strongly urge any person in this position to make enquiries of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_9655">In addition, from June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care regardless of their income.  Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding unemployment assistance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition.  This arrangement was introduced to acknowledge the needs of carers especially in relation to respite. Provision was made in Budget 2006 to increase the amount of the respite care grant from €1,000 to €1,200 from June 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_9656">I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me.  Those recommendations involving additional expenditure can only be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

         if his attention has been drawn to the growing disincentive for applicants of the financial contribution scheme for senior citizens to avail of the scheme due to the failure to update and raise the disregard threshold for means accruing from this scheme in line with house price inflation; will he immediately address the information deficit that currently exists for applicants in respect of the potential impact of the scheme on their social welfare entitlements; and will he immediately sign new regulations allowing for the disregard threshold to be updated.

            <p eId="para_9658">Financial contribution schemes are operated by local authorities in order to facilitate older people who wish to move from private accommodation, which may be too large for them, into local authority housing as tenants.  The issue for my Department is how the proceeds of such a sale are treated in the means test for social assistance payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_9659">Social assistance payments are designed to provide financial support for people who do not qualify for one of the contributory pension or benefit schemes. Entitlement to these payments is based on a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need.  Accordingly, any resources that a claimant and his or her spouse or partner may have are assessed.  These resources may include cash income, property, or an asset which could bring in money or provide the claimant with an income.  The value of a person's primary residence is not taken into account in the  means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_9660">The sale of residence provisions are designed to facilitate certain persons who are in receipt of a means tested payment from this Department in selling their principal residence for the purpose of:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9661">buying or renting alternative accommodation which s/he occupies as his/her only or main residence; or</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9662">moving into a private nursing home which has been registered under Section 4, Health (Nursing Home) Acts, 1990;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9663">moving in with their carer who is in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit in respect of them; or</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_9664">moving to sheltered or special housing in the voluntary, co-operative, statutory or private sectors that is funded under the Capital Assistance Scheme operated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_9665">Where alternative accommodation is being purchased the difference between the agreed sale price of the former residence and the agreed purchase price of the replacement residence, subject to a maximum of €190,461, is exempt from the means test.  Where no alternative accommodation is being purchased the gross proceeds of the sale are defined as the agreed sale price of the residence and are disregarded in the means test also to a maximum of €190,461.</p>
            <p eId="para_9666">These provisions apply to recipients of disability allowance, blind person's pension and those over age 66 years who receive a means tested payment from this Department and they are intended to facilitate choice for certain people who might previously have been living alone or in unsuitable accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_9667">Information on the means tests for non-contributory pensions is available from the Social Welfare Services Office, College Rd, Sligo.  Information booklets which include information on the means tests are available at local Social Welfare Offices and information is also available on my Department's website at <i>www.welfare.ie</i> or by telephoning the Department’s LoCall leaflet Request Line at 1890 20 23 25.  Information on entitlement to all social services is also provided by the Citizens Information Centres.</p>

         if he will extend the eligibility criteria for computer training courses to allow people who are the qualified adult dependents on their spouse’s pension or social welfare payment to earn a training allowance similar to lone parents and widows; the reason married women are being discriminated against and treated differently to others.

            <p eId="para_9692">Across the majority of social welfare payments, entitlement to an increase for a qualified adult is based, inter alia, on the spouse/partner's income.  An increase at the maximum rate is payable where the spouse/ partner's income is €100 per week or less, with a reduced or tapered rate payable where this income is between €100 and €250.</p>
            <p eId="para_9693">Since this Government came into office, a number of changes to these tapering arrangements have been introduced with a view to ensuring that the impact of increases in earnings are not negated for families where the spouse is the sole earner and is in low-paid employment.  Firstly, the range of income over which the increase for a qualified adult is withdrawn has been progressively extended.  Secondly, provision was made for the deferral of the loss of half the child dependant allowance until the earnings of the spouse/partner exceeds the upper bound of the income range, which has been increased in each successive Budget from €171.41 in 2000 to €250 during the course of 2006.  Thirdly, the qualified adult weekly rates have been increased annually in each Budget package.  It should be noted, therefore, that the increase for a qualified adult is now not fully withdrawn until the spouse/ partner's weekly income exceeds €250.</p>
            <p eId="para_9694">Where the spouse/partner of a claimant is in receipt of an allowance in respect of a full-time FÁS or VTOS course, s/he is not considered to be a qualified adult dependant.  The Training Authority/VEC is responsible for paying the spouse/partner a personal rate plus half rate child dependant increase (if applicable) for the duration of the course.</p>
            <p eId="para_9695">Where a spouse/partner is on a part-time FÁS/VEC course, the full increase for a qualified adult is payable where the spouse/partner's total gross weekly income (including training allowance) does not exceed €100.00.  Otherwise entitlement (if any) to a reduced increase is calculated in the usual way in line with weekly earnings between €100.00 and €250.00.  These rules also apply where a spouse/partner is participating in a full-time or part-time course which is not administered by FÁS or the VEC.</p>
            <p eId="para_9696">It should be noted that, for the purpose of calculation of means for one parent family payment and widows' pension, training allowances are assessed in the same way as earnings from employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_9697">One of the key objectives of the 2006 social welfare budget package was to protect and enhance the real value of all rates of payment.  In this context, it provided for increases in the main personal rates of weekly payments ranging from 9.4% to 14%.  The main qualified adult rates were also increased by the same percentages thereby ensuring that they did not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate. The lower threshold was increased from €88.88 to €100 and the earnings bands which dictated the rate of withdrawal of the increase for a qualified adult were extended from €6.35 to €10.</p>
            <p eId="para_9698">Any change in the current arrangements relating to the qualified adult increase would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in light of available resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_9705">The Family Income Supplement is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.  This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_9706">To ensure that families are made aware of these improvements, my Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign last March to promote and encourage a greatly increased take up of the family income supplement scheme for working families on low incomes.  This extensive week-long campaign included advertising on TV, on national and local radio and in the national and regional press.  A nation-wide poster campaign was also undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_9707">In addition, the scheme was promoted through my Department's network of Local Offices, Citizen Information Centres and Citizens Information Phone service and by Comhairle, the national information support agency.  Information was also made available through my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_9708">I am very pleased with the response so far to the campaign.  For example, from March to August this year my Department received 7,329 new FIS claims; this compares with 3,612 received in the same period in 2005.  My Department has received 9,734 new claims so far this year compared with 5,116 for the corresponding period in 2005.  The general trend for both new claims and renewals is for growth in the numbers applying for the scheme.  The advertising campaign has resulted in a higher than normal number of claims on hand (6,964) and I would expect a high percentage of these to translate into awards.</p>
            <p eId="para_9709">The increase in the numbers of persons receiving FIS is a positive development, reflecting the success of a range of Government measures which have improved net incomes for the low paid.  However, the significant increase in applications has resulted in a backlog in claim processing.</p>
            <p eId="para_9710">Entitlement to FIS is based on an applicant satisfying a means test and on certification of employment by the employer.  In some cases there is an unavoidable timelag involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable decisions to be made.  For example, there is an onus on applicants to furnish all necessary documentation.  Delays can occur through applicants not supplying all the necessary information in support of their claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_9711">My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  Some improvements have recently been introduced to directly address the efficiency of claim processing for FIS: A review of all existing processes and procedures has been undertaken with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing.  Priority is being given to claims where a claim is being renewed to ensure continuity of payment.  Additional staff resources have been assigned specifically to improve the delivery of service.</p>
            <p eId="para_9712">The impact of these measures will, over time, lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of claims on hand.  The position will be closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_9722">Guidelines are issued by my Department in relation to the legislation concerned to ensure consistency of decision making by Deciding Officers and these are also available to members of the public on the Department's website, <i>www.welfare.ie, </i>or on request from any social welfare local office.  In addition, training is provided to Deciding Officers on their statutory obligations and the application of principles of natural justice and fair procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_9723">Social Welfare legislation provides that decisions on social welfare claims must be set out in writing and, where the decision is unfavourable, the reasons for the decision must also be recorded and included in the notification to the person concerned.  Therefore, when a Deciding Officer has reached a decision, which is unfavourable to the claimant, s/he must give the grounds for the decision, that is, the statutory condition which is not fulfilled; and the reason why the grounds are not met.</p>
            <p eId="para_9724">Apart from the right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, a claimant may seek a review by a Deciding Officer in the first instance if there are any new facts or evidence that have not been taken into consideration when the initial decision was made.  This provides a means of having any adverse decisions reviewed as quickly as possible where new evidence becomes available.  The Deciding Officer re-examines the case quickly, and, if appropriate, the decision can be revised without having to go through the formal appeals process.  To this end, persons are advised of their right to seek a review of the initial decision. Where conflict remains, however, the person has the right to have his or her claim dealt with by way of appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_9725">If the claim has not been dealt with to the complainant's satisfaction, it can be brought to the attention of the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>

            <p eId="para_9809">The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season.  Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.</p>
            <p eId="para_9810">A number of improvements have been made to the scheme in recent years including the easing of the means test and extending the duration of payment from 26 weeks to 29 weeks.  Most recently, Budget 2006 provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of €5.00 from €9.00 to €14.00, or €17.90 in designated smokeless areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_9811">A detailed review of the fuel allowance was carried out in 1998.  This review looked at alternatives to the weekly payment method including a single lump sum payment.  A survey of recipients with the allowance on a customer panel showed that the majority (58%) preferred weekly payment, 22% wanted a once-off lump sum payment, 12% favoured direct debit to a supplier while 8% would rather have two lump sum payments during the fuel season.  The review recommended continuing with the weekly payment method.</p>
            <p eId="para_9812">I will keep all aspects of the fuel allowance scheme, including the issue of a lump sum payment, under review.  Any significant changes to the scheme that would require additional expenditure could only be considered within a budgetary context.</p>

        <b>Mr. Wall</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         the way in which his Department determines the value of the rent subsidy allocated by the community welfare office of the Health Service Executive on his behalf; the consultations that take place in such a determination; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [29367/06]

          </question>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_1142">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_9814">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_9815">Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_9816">In November 2002, when the Central Statistics Office Privately Owned Rent Index first showed signs of continued reductions in rent levels, regulations were introduced which set the maximum amount of rent in respect of which a rent supplement is payable.  These limits remained in place to the end of December 2003.  Further Regulations introduced in December 2003 prescribed the limits to be used between January 2004 and June 2005.  The current rent limits cover the period July 2005 to 31st December 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_9817">Under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent levels as an exceptional measure, for example: where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances for example, disabled persons in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons; where the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short period; where the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard and has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of Rent Supplement that is otherwise payable in the case.  This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9818">Despite recent increases in rent levels, the Central Statistics Office Privately Owned Rent Index shows that rent levels are currently at a similar level to that which applied in November 2002 when rent levels were first set by the Department.  In this context it is fair to say that the introduction of rent limits by regulation has had a positive impact on the rental market in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_9819">Officials from my Department are currently reviewing the existing rent limits in order to make recommendations regarding what limits should apply from January 2007 onwards.  This review will take account of prevailing rent levels in the private rental sector generally, together with detailed input from the Health Service Executive on the market situation within each of its administrative areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_9820">The review will also include consultation with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  In addition, it is expected that a number of the voluntary agencies working in this area will make detailed submissions to my Department.  This process will ensure that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country, and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_9822">The Pensions Board in its report on the national pensions review, published last January, suggested a number of measures in relation to social welfare pensions designed to encourage people to continue working after normal retirement age.  These included making such employment fully insurable for pensions purposes and allowing for enhanced payments when a person decides to defer claiming pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_9823">As indicated in reply to Question No 142, the Department is not in a position to operate such measures at present but that the matter would be further examined in the context of an overall review of the recommendations made by the Pensions Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_9824">Pensions was a major issue in the context of the negotiations on the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  Arising from these negotiations the Government is committed to publishing a Green Paper on pensions outlining the major policy choices, the challenges in this area and the views of the social partners Publication next year will be followed by a consultation process.  The Government are committed to responding to the consultations by developing a framework for comprehensively addressing the pensions agenda over the long-term.  The report of the Pensions Board on the national pensions review, and its recommendations, will be major inputs to this process.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_9826">Supporting and recognising carers in our society has been a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</p>
            <p eId="para_9827">Issues of taxation are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  However, I have introduced several improvements to payments from my Department in order to facilitate carers who wish to engage in employment.  From 1 June this year, I increased the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home and still satisfy the qualifying conditions for payment, from 10 to 15 hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_9828">In addition, in Budget 2006 I increased the length of time for which a person can claim carer's benefit from 65 to 104 weeks.  The duration of the associated carer's leave scheme has also been extended to two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_9829">Following significant progress in Budget 2006, the earnings disregard for a couple is currently set at €580 per week which is just at the level of gross average industrial earnings.  In accordance with the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, I am committed to expanding, subject to available resources, the income limits for carer's allowance aiming to keep the level of the disregard in line with average industrial earnings.</p>
            <p eId="para_9830">I am fully aware that co-operation between relevant Government Departments and Agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  In January 2005 the Minister for Health and Children and I established a Working Group on Long Term Care which comprises senior officials from both our Departments as well as the Departments of An Taoiseach and Finance and the Health Services Executive.  The report of this group is currently being considered by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_9831">The Government's commitment to cross-departmental co-operation is further reinforced in the new social partnership agreement 'Towards 2016' which commits my Department to leading the development of a structured consultation process to inform future policy in relation to carers.  This will involve an annual meeting of carer's representative groups as well as relevant Department and Agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_9832">Another key Government commitment in Towards 2016 is the development of a National Carer's Strategy by the end of 2007.  This strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community and will involve all relevant Departments and Agencies as well as the social partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_9833">I am committed to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families.  In that regard, I will continue to review the scope for further developments of the carer's allowance, carer's benefit and respite care grant.</p>

            <p eId="para_9835">The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  The basis of the restriction contained in the rules is the applicant's habitual residence.  The effect is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_9836">The operation of the habitual residence condition has been monitored closely by my Department since its introduction.  A comprehensive review of the operation of the condition which was undertaken in late 2005 by my Department was recently completed.  I intend to bring the Review to the attention of the Government with a view to publishing it in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_9837">It should be noted that between 1 May 2004 and end April 2006, over 34,000 claims, other than Supplementary Welfare Allowance, involving HRC issues from persons from over 150 countries have been examined by my Department.  This number includes claims to Child Benefit and social assistance, representing less than 10% of the overall number of claims for these schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9838">The main schemes affected are Unemployment Assistance and Child Benefit, which account for nearly 85% of the total number decided.  One Parent Family Payment and Disability Allowance claims account for nearly 10% of the total.  Of these claims: 34% referred to persons from some 130 countries outside the EU 25; 27% related to Irish nationals; 16% related to nationals from the EU 10; 13% related to claims from UK nationals; and 10% referred to people from the EU13, that is, EU 15 Member States other than Ireland and the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_9839">Over 26,000 (77%) of these claims were found to satisfy the condition and 8,000 (23%) were unsuccessful.  There were some 800 appeals against HRC decisions determined by the independent Appeals Office of which over 300 cases were determined in favour of the claimant.</p>

            <p eId="para_9841">The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</p>
            <p eId="para_9842">To qualify for participation in the BTEA scheme an applicant must, inter alia, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 6 months for a second level course or 12 months for a third level course.  This is reduced to 9 months if the applicant is participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process and where the third level course is approved by a FÁS Services Officer as part of that process.</p>
            <p eId="para_9843">This requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period of time has always been a feature of the BTEA scheme and is considered necessary in order to ensure that limited resources are targeted at those who are most in need.   The BTEA is an administrative stand-alone scheme and is not subject to legislation.  The primary reason for this is that it allows for a greater degree of flexibility in its administration.  Such flexibility is generally used to the benefit of the applicant.  With regard to the minimum qualifying period, officers may exercise a degree of discretion in circumstances where an applicant is short by a few days or a week at the most.</p>

            <p eId="para_9872">Workers are insured under social welfare legislation as either employed or self-employed contributors.  Employees and their employers generally pay contributions at PRSI Class A whereas self-employed workers generally pay contributions at PRSI Class S.  The class and number of contributions paid determine the range of benefits towards which contributors can build entitlement.  While employees who, together with their employers, are potentially liable for a total contribution of 14.05% under PRSI Class A, self-employed individuals pay Class S contributions at a rate of 3% and are potentially eligible for a narrower range of benefits than employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_9873">PRSI Class S contributors can be entitled to the following payments only: Widow's/Widower's (Contributory) Pension; Orphan's (Contributory) Allowance; Old Age (Contributory) Pension; Maternity Benefit; Adoptive Benefit, and Bereavement Grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_9874">When Class S was introduced for self-employed workers in 1988, coverage for short-term insurance-based schemes such as disability benefit, as well as illness or invalidity-related payments, was excluded on the grounds of cost and legal and administrative complexity.</p>
            <p eId="para_9875">The cost of introducing an insurance-based payment for self-employed workers with long-term illnesses would be contingent on the parameters to apply to the scheme.  Questions as to whether it would be aligned to existing disability benefit or invalidity pension schemes, whether an income cap would apply, or whether the worker would have to have a permanent or temporary incapacity would have to be examined. In relation to the personal scope, the questions for consideration would include whether it would apply to all self-employed workers or only to specific groups and whether it should be on a compulsory or voluntary basis.  Issues relating only to specific groups to the incidence of long-term disability among self-employed workers by comparison to employed workers would also need to be considered as would matters relating to the administration and monitoring of the scheme.  A previous estimate of the full year cost in 2003 terms, ranged from €67 million, if cover was extended to invalidity pension only, to €128 million per annum if the self-employed were covered for both disability benefit and invalidity pension.  Additional costs would arise on foot of improvements made to social welfare payments since.</p>
            <p eId="para_9876">There are no plans at present to extend cover for disability-related benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have to be considered in the wider budgetary context.  Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of PRSI Class S contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_9877">Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may claim supplementary welfare allowance, which is subject to a means test.</p>

            <p eId="para_9879">The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005, requires that the Minister undertake an actuarial review of the financial condition of the social insurance fund at five-year intervals.  The first actuarial review, as required under this legislation, was published in October, 2002, and reflected the position of the Social Insurance Fund at the end of 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_9880">A request for tender inviting interested parties to undertake a further review was issued in June 2006.  The focus of the Review is the income of the Fund (including the accumulated surplus), the contributory pensions and benefits paid from the Fund, including non-cash benefits (household benefits package) and other payments (redundancy and insolvency payments).  The period covered by the Review will be 55 years (from 2006 to 2061).</p>
            <p eId="para_9881">Following an evaluation process, a preferred bidder was selected from among the tenders received by the closing date 2 August 2006 and contractual arrangements are now being finalized.  The review will take approximately six months to complete and it is expected that the report will be published during the summer of 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_9883">Supporting and recognising carers in our society has been a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</p>
            <p eId="para_9884">One of the fundamental qualification conditions for carer's allowance is that the applicant must be providing full-time care and attention to a person who needs such care.  Since the introduction of the carer's allowance scheme this full-time care and attention requirement has been eased in order to facilitate carers in engaging in employment, education or training.</p>
            <p eId="para_9885">Until June this year people could engage in employment outside the home for up to 10 hours per week and still qualify for payment.  Since then, I have increased the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home and still satisfy the qualifying conditions for payment, from 10 to 15 hours per week.  This improvement applies to carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_9886">I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me and that recognise and support the valued and valuable contribution of all carers in a tangible way.</p>

            <p eId="para_9888">The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance.

            <p eId="para_9892">The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemakers scheme which was introduced from 1994.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9893">However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age must also be satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_9894">There is a proposal to replace the disregard system with one based on actual credited contributions and this is under consideration by my Department.  With regard to backdating the homemakers scheme, it is important to point out that in general, changes to insurability of employment arrangements are not back-dated and this principle was applied to the homemakers scheme in 1994.</p>
            <p eId="para_9895">The review referred to has not been finalised.  Instead, it has been decided that it will be encompassed in the Green Paper on overall pensions policy to which the Government is committed as part of the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  Publication of the Green Paper will be followed by a consultation process and a framework for future pension policy later in the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_9900">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1046 to 1049, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9901">The Outline Sectoral Plan, produced by my Department under the Disability Act 2005 and as part of the National Disability Strategy, proposed that Comhairle prepare a scheme relating to sign language interpretation (SLI) services in Ireland.  In preparation for this task, Comhairle commissioned consultants to review existing SLI services and requirements and to research international best practice.  This review was carried out and a report was completed in December 2005, and was presented to me in May 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_9902">The review aimed to establish the overall demand for SLI services and the extent to which this demand is currently being met.  The review also set out to establish the needs of the key stakeholders, to examine the models of good practice, including the use of technology, and to recommend models and structures for the future development of SLI services, including financial, governance and organisational structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_9903">The process included consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including the deaf community, representative bodies, service providers and Government Departments.  Following the publication of the Report, briefing sessions were arranged by Comhairle with a number of the key stakeholders at which the outcome of the study was presented, the proposed service model was set out and implementation of the report was discussed.</p>
            <p eId="para_9904">The report makes recommendations in relation to how SLI services might best be established and proposes a model for the development of the service, including the establishment of structures that would facilitate access to interpretative services for deaf people throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_9905">The two phased approach outlined in the report allows for the transitional and incremental changes necessary to facilitate the planning, managing and monitoring of the services during its implementation.  My Department will continue to examine the implications of the recommendations of the report throughout the development of the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_9906">The briefing sessions have now been completed.  The key stakeholders who took part in the briefings included Irish Sign Link, the National Association for the Deaf, the Irish Deaf Society and the Irish Association of Sign Language Interpreters.  In addition, meetings were held with the TCD School of Linguistics, Speech and Communications and Bridge Interpreting.</p>
            <p eId="para_9907">A Steering Group has been established by Comhairle to implement the report recommendations.  My Department is represented on the Steering Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_9908">The first stage of the implementation of the report will commence in early 2007.  A new entity will be established which will have clear responsibility for setting the strategic direction and for providing leadership in relation to the development of the services.</p>
            <p eId="para_9909">I am satisfied that the proposed future model will improve public services accessibility to the deaf community.</p>

            <p eId="para_9912">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1050 and 1051 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9913">The case to which the Deputy refers relates to Directive 80/987/EEC which provides for the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  The High Court in the U.K. referred a case to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling on whether Article 8 of this Directive requires "Member States to ensure, by whatever means necessary, that employees' accrued rights under supplementary company or inter-company final salary pension schemes are fully funded by Member States in the event that the employees' private employer becomes insolvent and the assets are insufficient to fund those benefits".</p>
            <p eId="para_9914">Article 8 of the Directive requires that "Member States shall ensure that the necessary measures are taken to protect the interests of employees and of persons having already left the employer's undertaking or business at the date of the employer's insolvency in respect of the rights conferring immediate or prospective entitlement to old-age benefits, including survivors' benefits, under supplementary company or inter-company pension schemes outside the national statutory social security schemes."  However, the Directive elsewhere enables Member States to limit the liability of the guarantee institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_9915">In Ireland, Article 8 of the Directive was implemented by Section 7 of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984.  This provides that in the event of an employer's insolvency, any contributions deducted from any employee in the 12 months prior to insolvency and which remain unpaid, and any contributions due to be paid by the employer into the scheme in the 12 months prior to the insolvency, unless a lesser amount would discharge the liabilities, may be made from the Social Insurance Fund into the occupational pension scheme.  In addition to the measures taken to implement this Directive, existing provisions are in place under the Pensions Act 1990 to protect members' benefits under occupational pension schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9916">Part IV of the Pensions Act 1990 sets out a minimum funding standard for defined benefit pension schemes.  This is a wind-up standard, based on the benefits a scheme is obliged to provide should the scheme be wound up.  In addition, having sufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme is now also a requirement under EU Directive 2003/41/EC, which my Department implemented in September 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_9917">The issues arising from this particular case relate to two Government Departments, namely, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has responsibility for the Insolvency Payments Scheme and which, under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984, administers the implementation of all of the provisions of the Directive, and my Department, which has responsibility for pension issues and the Social Insurance Fund, from which insolvency payments under the Insolvency Payments Scheme are made.</p>
            <p eId="para_9918">Given the similarity in pension systems it is no surprise to note that the UK implemented Article 8 of the Directive in much the same manner as Ireland.  A report from the Commission on 15 June 1995 analysing national laws transposing the Directive found that in the case of Ireland, there was no cause for objection.</p>
            <p eId="para_9919">In the context of this case, Member States were invited by the European Court to submit statements of case or written observations to the Court of Justice by the 25th October 2005.  Arising from this invitation, I and my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment accordingly arranged for the Attorney General to submit observations.  The observations were submitted having regard to the potential implications for Ireland of this case and in order to ensure that the Irish position was fully presented.</p>
            <p eId="para_9920">An oral hearing in this case was held on June 1st at which Ireland was represented.  Following the hearing, the Advocate General delivered her opinion on the 13th July 2006 in advance of the final ruling of the European Court of Justice.  While the Advocate General considers that the Directive in principle requires full protection of employees' interests with regard to prospective rights to pension benefits, she agrees with the UK Government and Ireland in their respective submissions that the Member States cannot directly incur liability under the Directive in respect of shortfalls in pension benefits that have not been adequately secured.  However, it would be premature to consider any possible implications of this case until the final ruling by the European Court of Justice, which is not expected until the end of 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_9923">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1052 and 1053 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9924">People providing full-time care who are in receipt of carers allowance, carers benefit or prescribed relatives allowance receive the respite care grant automatically, without having to apply for it.  The same applies where a constant attendance allowance is in payment.  Payment is made on or after the first Thursday in June of the year to which the payment refers.</p>
            <p eId="para_9925">Budget 2005 extended entitlement to the Grant to all full-time carers irrespective of means or contribution record but subject to certain conditions relating to the need for and the provision of full-time care and attention.  A section was set up in my Department to process applications from people in this newly entitled category.</p>
            <p eId="para_9926">The grant in respect of 2006 is payable to people who meet the qualifying conditions on Thursday 1 June 2006 and is payable on or as soon as practicable after that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_9927">To date in 2006, the grant has been paid to 26,000 people who are entitled to receive it automatically without having to apply.  Applications for the 2006 grant from those not entitled to receive it automatically by virtue of their primary payment, are being solicited in two phases.  Firstly, those who applied for and received the grant in 2005 have been written to enclosing a brief questionnaire to establish whether they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of the grant in 2006.  On foot of this initiative, approximately 6,500 applications have been received to date.  By its very nature, the receipt of a large volume of applications over a relatively short period puts pressures on the section processing applications and some delays in making payments ensue.  However, the 6,500 applications have been cleared and grants have been paid to 5,444 successful applicants.  Completed questionnaires continue to be received and these are being cleared on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_9928">Applications for the 2005 grant continue to be received and a number of applications for the 2006 grant have also been received from people who did not apply for the 2005 grant.  Between the two, there are approximately 950 cases on hands and these are currently being processed.  In addition, as the 2005 applications are processed, successful applicants are invited to apply for the 2006 grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_9929">The second phase of the campaign to identify those people who may be eligible for the Grant is currently underway in the form of a national awareness campaign to promote awareness of supports for carers, including the respite care grant.  This campaign, which began last Sunday, 24 September, includes extensive advertising for this week on television, national and regional radio and in the national and regional print media.  A LoCall telephone number, 1890 66 22 44, is provided which people can contact for further information.</p>

         the number of people who have received the carer’s respite grant in 2006; if he has satisfied himself that all those entitled to same are aware of this grant; if he will make further effort to make them aware; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_9938">People providing full-time care who are in receipt of carers allowance, carers benefit or prescribed relatives allowance receive the respite care grant automatically, without having to apply for it.  The same applies where a constant attendance allowance is in payment.  Payment is made on or after the first Thursday in June of the year to which the payment refers.  To date in 2006 the grant has been paid to 26,000 people in this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_9939">Budget 2005 extended entitlement to the grant to all full-time carers irrespective of means or contribution record but subject to certain conditions relating to the provision of full-time care and attention.  A section was set up in my Department to process applications from people in this newly entitled category.</p>
            <p eId="para_9940">The grant in respect of 2006 is payable to people who meet the qualifying conditions on Thursday 1 June 2006.  Applications for the 2006 grant from people in this category are being solicited in two phases.  Firstly, those who applied for and received the grant in 2005 were written to enclosing a brief questionnaire to establish whether they continued to satisfy the conditions for receipt of the grant in 2006 and, on foot of this initiative, grants have been paid to 5,444 successful applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_9941">The second phase of the campaign to identify those people who may be eligible for the grant entails a national awareness campaign to promote awareness of supports for carers, including the respite care grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_9942">The underlying objective of my Department's information policy is to ensure that all citizens, including carers, are made aware of their entitlements under a broad range of social insurance, social assistance and other supports and are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur.</p>
            <p eId="para_9943">Carers have been the target of a number of awareness campaigns undertaken by my Department in recent years.  In 2005, a major publicity campaign was undertaken to publicise the availability of the new respite care grant to carers providing full time care. The campaign included advertisements in provincial and national newspapers and a freephone helpline to explain the eligibility conditions for the grant.  A comprehensive information article on the respite care grant was prepared by my Department and distributed to all carers support organisations for inclusion in their publications and literature.</p>
            <p eId="para_9944">Information officers and other staff in my Department involved in providing information to Carers and Community Welfare Officers were provided with comprehensive briefing to enable them to provide guidance and assistance to carers enquiring about the scheme.  Posters were widely distributed throughout the country to all local offices of my Department, to the Citizens Information Centres and to some 800 Health Centres for public health nurses, GPs and other health care staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_9945">My Department is currently conducting a national awareness campaign to promote awareness of supports for carers, including the respite care grant.  This campaign, which began last Sunday, 24 September, includes extensive advertising for this week on television, national and regional radio and in the national and regional print media. A LoCall telephone number, 1890 66 22 44, is provided which people can contact for further information.</p>
            <p eId="para_9946">Comprehensive information on social welfare schemes and supports, including information on the respite care grant, is available from my Department's network of 125 social welfare local offices throughout the country.  Information is also available on my Department's website, <i>www.welfare.ie, </i>and any social welfare leaflet or application form can be ordered from our LoCall Leaflet Line 1890 20 23 25.</p>
            <p eId="para_9947">In addition to the information services provided by my Department, Comhairle, the national information agency under the aegis of my Department, has responsibility for supporting the provision of independent information and advice to citizens.  Citizens Information Centres based in 247 locations throughout the country provide information to members of the public on the full range of social services.</p>
            <p eId="para_9948">My Department will continue to work closely with voluntary and national organisations that provide support to Carers and every opportunity will be taken to promote schemes and services for Carers.  The provision of quality information to meet the particular needs of carers is a high priority for my Department in the drive to ensure that carers are aware of and claim their entitlements.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_9950">My Department operates a number of schemes which provide income support to persons with an illness or disability, including the disability benefit and invalidity pension schemes and the means-tested disability allowance and blind pension.  The number of people currently in receipt of these schemes and with comparative numbers for 1997 is: Disability Benefit 66,195 (42,460 in 1997); Invalidity Pension 60,537 (43,046 in 1997); Disability Allowance 81,315 (37,054 in 1997) and Blind Pension 1,959 (2,450 in 1997).</p>
            <p eId="para_9951">The increase in the number of recipients of the main schemes for illness and disability is reflective of an increased entitlement to benefits arising from the growth of the workforce generally as well as improvements made to the Disability Allowance scheme since its transfer from the then Health Boards in 1996.</p>
            <p eId="para_9952">Facilitating return to work and participation in the active labour force with a view to assisting people to become more financially independent is one of the main objectives of the social welfare system and a key goal in my Department's Statement of Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_9953">There are a number of specific incentives available within the system to encourage and facilitate people, including people with illness or disabilities, to take-up or return to employment, or to undertake education and training options.</p>
            <p eId="para_9954">These incentives include exemptions from the general "no work" conditions of the disability benefit and invalidity pension schemes to facilitate people to undertake work of a rehabilitative nature and there are over 6,200 people currently availing of such exemptions.  In addition, there are income disregards which fully exempt a portion of earnings (currently €120 per week) from the means-tested disability allowance and blind pension payments and over 6,600 people are currently availing of this disregard.</p>
            <p eId="para_9955">In order to improve the incentives for people with disabilities to take up and progress within employment, as part of the social welfare budget package 2006, a new 50% withdrawal rate of Disability Allowance and Blind Pension payments has been introduced, effective from June 2006, for earnings above €120 per week and under €350 per week.  This measure replaces the previous euro for euro withdrawal above the €120 per week disregard and will mean that a single person can earn up to €390 per week before their Disability Allowance or Blind Pension is fully withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_9956">Access to the Back to Work Allowance scheme, designed to assist people to return to employment, is also available (subject to certain conditions) to people in receipt of Disability Benefit, Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance and Blind Pension.  This is a weekly payment which allows people to take up approved employment while retaining a percentage of their social welfare payment for three years (four years in the case of self-employment) and to retain any secondary benefits to which they have been entitled for that period.  There are in excess of 1,400 people availing of the Back to Work Allowance who have been in receipt of illness or disability payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_9957">Access to the Back to Education scheme (subject to qualifying conditions) is similarly available for people in receipt of the aforementioned schemes.  This is an allowance paid at a standard rate, for the duration of the educational course which the person undertakes, at either second or third level.  Any secondary benefits to which the person had entitlement are also retained for the duration of the payment.  In addition, an annual cost of education allowance is payable at the commencement of each academic year to assist with the purchase of books and other relevant materials.  There are currently 695 people participating in the Back to Education scheme who had been receiving disability or illness payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_9958">My Department has recently published its Disability Sectoral Plan, in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act, 2005 and the National Disability Strategy.  While the primary focus of my Department is on providing and developing income support payments, it also has a role in providing opportunities to encourage and assist people to become less dependent on the social welfare system and to move to a position where they can, to a far greater extent, meet their income needs from employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_9959">I am also conscious of the need to recognise, in addition to economic outcomes, the potential for advancement through a variety of activation measures, such as furthering education or developing life skills.  In this context the sectoral plan outlines a significant proposal for a new economic and social model of participation, based on a life cycle approach for people of all working age, including people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_9960">I am committed to ensuring that no individual's talent or contribution is overlooked, and to helping our customers to achieve their full potential, both in terms of participation in the labour market and in wider society.</p>

            <p eId="para_9962">The living alone allowance or living alone increase as it is now known, is an additional payment of €7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes.  The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone. The payment was last increased in 1996.  If it had increased each year in line with inflation the rate of payment would now be around €10.13 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_9963">The living alone increase is a targeted measure aimed at a particular group of pensioners.  However, the policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than focusing on payments such as the living alone increase.  This approach ensures that resources are used to improve the position of all pensioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_9964">The Government is committed to increasing the level of the basic State pension to €200 per week by 2007.  Further significant progress towards achieving this target was made in Budget 2006, which provided for increases in pensions of up to €14 and €16 per week.  The maximum rate of the old age contributory pension is now €193.30 per week with the maximum non-contributory pension paid at €182 per week.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
          his views on extending the continuation of child benefit payments until the age of 22 in respect of young people who are in full-time education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_9966">Unlike other social welfare payments requiring qualifying contributions or assessment of means, child benefit is a universal payment, paid in respect of children up to the age of 16 years regardless of the level or source of parental income.  It continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_9967">The policy of the Government over the past number of years has been to substantially increase the amount spent on child benefit for all families.  Commitment to this policy is reflected in the significant resources invested in the scheme since 2001, increasing monthly payments to €150.00 for each of the first two children and €185.00 for the third and subsequent children from April 2006, increases of €96.04 (177%) and €113.89 (160%) respectively.  According to figures collected by the Central Statistics Office under the Quarterly National Household Survey for the period March 2006 to May 2006, there were an estimated 88,600 students aged from 19 years up to 22 years.  Extending child benefit to this category would therefore entail substantial cost, estimated to be in the region of €167 million annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_9968">In recognition of the need to target limited available resources at persons on low incomes with children in full-time education, a number of provisions have been introduced, including the extension of entitlement to child dependant allowance to age 22 where the parent of a full-time student (including third level) is in receipt of either a long-term social welfare payment, or a short-term social welfare payment for six months or more (short-term schemes include such payments as Unemployment Benefit and Assistance, Disability Benefit and Supplementary Welfare Allowance).</p>
            <p eId="para_9969">In addition, in-work cash payments are provided to low-paid employees with families through the family income supplement (FIS) scheme.  Under this scheme, a qualified child is any child under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 22 if in full-time education.  This supplement is paid where a family's weekly income is below a specified income limit for the family size, and is calculated at 60% of the difference between the net family income (gross pay less tax, PRSI, health contribution, superannuation) and the relevant income limit.  Further information regarding the FIS scheme can be obtained from any local office of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_9970">I will continue to keep further improvements to the child benefit scheme under regularreview.</p>

            <p eId="para_9972">The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity/gas allowance, telephone allowance and television licence schemes, is generally available to people living permanently in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition.  Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</p>
            <p eId="para_9973">The primary objective of the telephone allowance scheme is to ensure access to help in an emergency and to provide an element of security.  A secondary objective is to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_9974">The administrative and technical arrangements for payment of the household benefits were originally designed for a relationship with a single provider per utility market and are not sustainable in a deregulated energy market environment with multiple service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_9975">However, I am committed to the development of the telephone allowance scheme to respond to the expanding telecommunications market and to facilitate greater customer choice of telephone services including the use of mobile phones.  This is particularly important given the high level of mobile phone ownership in Ireland now and the fact that some households do not have land lines at all.</p>
            <p eId="para_9976">My Department has carried out a fundamental review of the operational arrangements with the various service providers which examined the position regarding the opening up of the telecommunications market, including mobile phone services and the impact this will have on the telephone allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_9977">When considering the extension of this scheme to cover mobile phones, there are administrative and technical issues to be resolved both internally within the department and externally in the market.  My Department is currently in discussion with the various stakeholders with a view to resolving their issues in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_9979">Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) is an important part of the social welfare system. Social Insurance provides a range of benefits to customers at certain specified times in their lives.  The integrity of the PRSI system is dependent on timely, appropriate contributions being made to the Social Insurance Fund by employers, employees and the self employed as laid down in social welfare legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_9980">Contributions due to the Social Insurance Fund are collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  My Department's Inspectorate also have responsibilities in relation to ensuring that employers and the self employed comply with their obligations in relation to Pay Related Social Insurance contributions.  Employer compliance in this regard, is monitored by Inspectors whose remit includes a detailed examination of employers' records to ensure that correct PRSI payments are being made in respect of all their employees.  In addition, any irregularity in a customer's PRSI record either detected at claim processing stage or reported directly by the customer, is referred to the Inspectorate for follow up action.</p>
            <p eId="para_9981">Where PRSI undercharges are confirmed, the Inspector sets out PRSI arrears/underpayment in respect of each employee for each tax year and issue a demand to the employer for payment.  Should the employer fail to respond satisfactorily, a statutory demand issues by registered post and the employer is given 14 days to respond. If the employer fails to respond the case may be referred for prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_9982">If the employer is not able to produce wage records, the employee is asked to complete a statement (Form IN12) detailing evidence of employment and payment of earnings is obtained.If the employment is confirmed either by way of wage inspection or employee statement, my Department's Central Records Unit is advised to update the employee's PRSI record for the period of employment in question. In cases where a customer makes a claim for a social insurance payment, entitlement to the payment is established using the information gathered during the investigation.</p>

            <p eId="para_9996">Primary responsibility for the promotion of the Irish cruise sector rests with Cruise Ireland.  Cruise Ireland is an all Ireland non-profit voluntary marketing initiative that was established in 1994, to promote Ireland as a destination for cruise ships.  The Cruise Ireland initiative originally brought together Bord Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, seven port authorities from the Republic, two port authorities from Northern Ireland and three tour operators.  All of these bodies, including Tourism Ireland, which is the all Ireland agency responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a holiday destination, are still actively engaged in supporting the Cruise Ireland initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_9997">Port companies play a key role in the promotion of cruise tourism and local tourism interests are being encouraged to play an increasing role in the promotion of the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_9998">The world cruise industry's major convention is held every year in Miami.  For the last three years, Irish Ministers of State have attended these Seatrade Cruise Conventions, to support the work of Cruise Ireland and the marketing of Ireland as a cruise destination.</p>
            <p eId="para_9999">The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO), the shipping sector's dedicated development agency, also supports the work of Cruise Ireland.  The IMDO estimates that the cruise industry was worth over €100 million to the economy in 2005.  Passenger numbers increased by 28% from 146,000 passengers in 2004 to over 187,000 in 2005, with an estimated 55% of those visitors being American nationals.  The IMDO forecasts further growth in cruise passenger numbers this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_10002">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1069 and 1103 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_10003">The Government's Ports Policy Statement, which I launched early last year, aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs.  One of the key challenges that lie ahead is the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, particularly for unitised trade.  The Policy Statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a coordinated manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_10004">As indicated in the Ports Policy Statement, the Government expects that the port companies, as commercial entities, should be capable of funding their operations and infrastructure requirements without relying on Exchequer support.  Such support would only be considered in cases where it was clearly demonstrated that State intervention was essential as the residual financier after opportunities available to the ports themselves (through efficiencies, optimum use of existing resources and port charge adjustments) and to the private sector (through direct investment and/or joint ventures) were exhausted and that the funding would contribute to national capacity requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_10005">Further to the Ports Policy Statement, my Department appointed in September 2005 a firm of consultants expert in this field, Fisher Associates, to help determine whether the anticipated capacity requirement to 2014 and beyond can be efficiently and adequately met through the successful advancement and implementation by the port sector of some combination of the various proposals currently under development in the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_10006">Detailed submissions outlining proposals for new capacity for unitised trade were received from the following ports and evaluated by Fisher Associates: Cork, Greenore, Dublin, Drogheda, Rosslare, Shannon Foynes and Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_10007">The final report of Fisher Associates was completed in June 2006. It is intended to publish the broad conclusions of the report in an Information Paper shortly, which will be available on my Department's website at <i>www.transport.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_10011">The Rural Transport Initiative (RTI) is a pilot scheme, under which funding is made available to thirty-four community-based organisations across the country, including two projects which are operational in County Kildare, to address the transport needs of their rural areas through the provision of local transport services.</p>
            <p eId="para_10012">Pobal administers the initiative on behalf of the Department of Transport, and makes specific allocations to individual project groups from funding provided by the Department. Neither the Minister for Transport nor his Department has any function in relation to specific allocations to individual project groups. Similarly, Pobal, together with the individual RTI project groups, are solely responsible for all the operational aspects of the initiative, including the specific services to be provided and the methods of provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_10013">Following the success of the pilot phase of the RTI, my colleague the Minister for Transport announced his intention to conclude this phase at the end of 2006 and to put the Initiative on a permanent footing from 2007 onwards.  Proposals in that regard have recently been the focus of a public consultation process and the Department will now proceed to finalise its policy options with due consideration for the comments received.</p>
            <p eId="para_10014">The Department has been steadily increasing the funding for the RTI in recent years.  Euro 4.5 million was provided for the RTI in 2005, which was a 50% increase on the 2004 allocation, while the 2006 allocation is Euro 5.1 million.  By the end of 2006 total funding for the initiative will have exceeded Euro 18.5 million.  This compares with the original proposed allocation of Euro 4.4 million in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_10015">Based on the 2005 allocation of Euro 4.5 million, and in parallel with the implementation of the Government's ten-year Transport Investment Framework, Transport 21, the Department will double the cash funding available to the RTI from 2007.  Thereafter, the funding available for rural transport services will steadily increase; ultimately to a cash level about four times the 2005 allocation.</p>

            <p eId="para_10017">In accordance with EU law, I have no direct responsibility in relation to setting motor insurance premiums. Insurance cover is provided by licensed companies based on actuarial or statistical date or other underwriting or commercial factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_10018">My Department, however, is taking the lead role in implementing the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board (MIAB).  This forms the bedrock of the Government's Insurance Reform Programme initiated in 2002 and I am pleased to say that the reform programme has been very successful to date.  In particular, we have been very successful in reducing the cost and increasing the availability of motor insurance.  Between April 2003 and August 2006, overall motor insurance premia have fallen by some 28.5 percent.</p>
            <p eId="para_10019">Unfortunately, the cost of insurance for young drivers has not fallen in line with the general downward trend in the cost of insurance.  This is mainly due to the proportionally higher incidence of collisions involving young drivers and, in particular, young male drivers.  Statistical and research data by the insurance industry have shown that young male drivers are high risk category and are priced by the industry accordingly.  However, my officials are aware of a number of companies who offer special discounts to young drivers based on those drivers fulfilling certain conditions. In accordance with the best consumer advice, I would advise young drivers to shop around for the best price that suits their particular circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_10023">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1073, 1116 and 1117 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_10024">The Road Traffic Acts provides that a member of the Garda Síochána may, where he or she is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, require that person to go to a Garda station and further require that person submit to a blood test or to provide a urine sample which will then be subject to analysis by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_10025">The Medical Bureau of Road Safety continues to analyse blood and urine specimens received under the Road Traffic Acts for the presence of a drug or drugs.  In 2004, 569 specimens were tested for the presence of a drugs or drugs.  354 specimens tested positive and 215 were found to be negative for the presence of a drug or drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_10026">There is no feasible basis for the introduction of a scheme of preliminary roadside testing for drugs at present.  However, screening devices based on oral fluid specimens are being developed for the purpose of carrying out roadside drug testing.  Such testing devices are in prototype stages and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is keeping abreast of developments in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_10027">The Bureau undertook a two-year research programme of drug analysis of blood and urine samples in 2001 and 2002.  The complete confirmatory results of the survey identifies trends in the types of drugs being taken, their combination with alcohol, and the incidence of polydrug use.  The confirmation analysis of specimens continued in 2003 and the data collection and report was published in June 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_10028">The study indicates that 15.7% of all tested drivers were positive for one or more drugs; that of the drivers who were under the limit for alcohol, 33.1% were positive for one or more drugs; and that of the drivers with very low or zero levels of alcohol, 67.9% were positive for drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_10029">The offence of driving under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent that the driver is incapable of having proper control of the vehicle attracts a disqualification of not less than 2 years in the case of a first offence, and, not less than 4 years in the case of a second or any subsequent offence.

            <p eId="para_10095">I set out the position in relation to the Integrated Ticketing project in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 456 on 6th July 2006 and announced that I was in the process of establishing an Integrated Ticketing Project Board with responsibility for delivering the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_10096">The Project Board has now been established and comprises an independent Chairperson, David O'Callaghan, the Chief Executives of the Railway Procurement Agency, Dublin Bus, Irish Rail, Bus Éireann and a representative of licensed private bus operators.  An Assistant Secretary from my Department is also on the Board and a senior representative of the Department of Social and Family Affairs also attends as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_10097">The Board is accountable to me and is required to formally report on progress in September 2006 and every 3 months thereafter, or more frequently if circumstances require.  On its establishment, I set the Board a number of immediate tasks:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10098">review and settle by way of agreement the scope, timelines and budget for the phased completion of the integrated ticketing project;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10099">review the ticketing plans and associated timelines of the transport agencies to satisfy itself on their compatibility with the integrated ticketing project;</p>

            <p eId="para_10103">I have asked the Project Board to report back to me by  the end of September, 2006 with an agreed delivery strategy for the integrated ticketing project. I expect to receive this report in the next few days.  Some €10.5 million has been paid out to date by the Exchequer on integrated ticketing since commencement of the project in 2002.</p>

            <p eId="para_10105">Since 1999, Iarnród Éireann has invested over 1.5 billion euro in rebuilding the railways, with Government and EU support for the investment programme.

            <p eId="para_10106">Iarnród Éireann has made progress in growing the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, including mineral ore and pulpwood.  For example Iarnród Éireann has:</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10109">modified surplus platform wagons to provide a trainload service for containers between Ballina and Waterford Port.</p>
            <p eId="para_10110">The position regarding competition in the rail freight market is that the European Communities (Access to Railway Infrastructure) (Amendment) Regulations, 2005 (S.I. 780 of 2005), allow for the opening of the freight market to competition from 1 January 2006, in the case of international freight, and from 1 January 2007 for domestic freight operations.  No formal applications have been received by my Department to date, for a Railway Undertaking licence or for track access.  The feasibility of transporting organic farm produce from the West of Ireland by rail is a matter for consideration in the first instance by those involved in the business and Iarnród Éireann.</p>

The text was unanimously endorsed at the December 2005 Transport Council subject to sufficient progress by the US side on opening up ownership and control of US airlines to EU investors.  The formal US process of changing its ownership and control rules was expected to be concluded in August 2006 so that a final decision could be taken at the October Transport Council.  However, due to difficulties on the US side the rule-making process has been extended.</p>
            <p eId="para_10121">I am fully committed to the view that the liberalisation of air transport services between Ireland and the US will deliver major benefits for Irish business and tourism.

            <p eId="para_10278">The most serious driving offences, including dangerous driving, can attract automatic disqualification upon first court conviction and are therefore not within the penalty points system or the system of fixed charges.</p>

By the end of 2007, a programme of investment in automating level crossings on the Dublin to Westport/Ballina route will have been completed.

When the new rolling stock comes into service, Iarnród Éireann has indicated that it proposes to increase the daily frequency of services on the line from three services each way to five services each way, and to provide a mix of direct services and services between Westport/Ballina and Athlone, connecting to Galway to Dublin trains.</p>

            <p eId="para_10304">There is a system of recognition of licences from non-EU countries for licence exchange, and licences from a number of countries are so recognised. Under this system, persons holding a valid driving licence from a recognised state may exchange their licence for an Irish driving licence where they take up residence here, without the need for a driving test.  Ireland does not, however, have a bilateral agreement with New Zealand for the exchange of driving licences.  For licence exchange purposes the licensing system of the country being recognised must meet EU standards as laid down in EU directives on driving licences.</p>

            <p eId="para_10323">The nature of the problems identified in the VOSA report are not unique to Irish vehicles and drivers.  Of course, the UK authorities are entitled to prosecute any vehicle driver for failure to comply with relevant UK legislation and that is a matter for the UK authorities to pursue.</p>
            <p eId="para_10324">Insofar as improving vehicles standards and enforcement in the State is concerned, the Oireachtas recently enacted the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 which strengthens the institutional framework for improving enforcement levels for vehicle and driver legislation and for increasing cooperation with the Garda Síochána, which is responsible for the enforcement of Road traffic law.  The authority, which was formally established on 1 September 2006, has now taken over responsibility for matters relating to vehicle standards, roadworthiness testing and enforcement of drivers hours, tachograph and licensing regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_10325">The chief executive of the authority is putting in place the necessary resources to fulfil its mandate and in that regard four vehicle testers have been recruited by the authority recently.  The addition of these testers combined with the recruitment of four new engineers, which is currently in process, will significantly strengthen the capacity of the authority in vehicle standards.  Further resources will be procured by the authority as and when the need arises.  Over time the number of serving transport officers will double from the current nine to 18.  The CEO has met recently with the Department for Transport (UK) and VOSA to agree protocols for joint working.  In addition the Road Safety Authority is working in partnership with the Irish Road Haulage Association to address standards in the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_10326">As far as enforcement is concerned, the Garda Síochána has brought the traffic corps within a more unified structure under the direction of the Commissioner.  There has been a significant increase in the strength of the Garda traffic corps.  The corps is being increased from 500 in early 2005 to 800 by the end of this year and 1,200 by 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_10327">There is ongoing and close cooperation between the Irish and UK enforcement agencies in the enforcement of drivers' hours rules.  This cooperation includes regular coordinated enforcement checks organised between the two jurisdictions and regular exchange of intelligence.</p>
            <p eId="para_10328">I am satisfied that the institutional arrangements now in place will strengthen the regime for monitoring compliance with vehicle standards and drivers hours rules.</p>

            <p eId="para_10338">Park and ride facilities have an important role in making it easier for people to access and transfer to public transport.  Last summer I approved a Dublin Transportation Office (DTO) strategy for rail-based park and ride facilities, which envisages facilities at 22 locations on the existing and proposed rail network within the greater Dublin area.</p>
            <p eId="para_10339">This year I set aside €5 million in capital funding for the development under Transport 21.  Applications will be evaluated according to their business cases and against the strategic value they offer, as assessed against the DTO strategy.

            <p eId="para_10340">The DTO has been consulted on preliminary designs for a 320 space park and ride at Leixlip/Louisa Bridge Station that is being proposed by Iarnród Éireann and my Department has approved funding for this project.  The DTO has recently worked with Iarnród Éireann and Meath County Council to progress the provision of a new 250 space park and ride facility at Laytown rail station, replacing a 90 space car park.</p>
            <p eId="para_10341">Funding is also being made available under Transport 21 for bus priority measures and park and ride in the regional cities.  It is a matter for the local authorities in each regional city to prioritise the most suitable locations for park and ride and to apply to my Department for funding for the capital cost of appropriate park and ride facilities.  Any applications received from local authorities will be considered on a first come first served basis and will be evaluated according to their business cases.  I have not yet received any applications for the development of park and ride facilities in the regional cities in 2006, but I understand that several authorities are considering possible sites.</p>

            <p eId="para_10356">The scheme of community support for older people is aimed at encouraging and assisting the community's support for older people by means of a community based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members.  This is why the scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_10357">In addition to funding the once-off cost of installing socially monitored alarm systems, the scheme also provides funding for door locks, window locks, door chains, security lighting and smoke alarms.  There is also provision for interior emergency lighting for older people living on our offshore islands.</p>
            <p eId="para_10358">Maximum individual grants under the scheme are as follows: €300 in respect of socially monitored alarms; €200 in respect of physical security equipment; €200 in respect of security lighting; €50 in respect of smoke alarms; €150 in respect of interior emergency lighting, for qualifying older people living on our offshore islands.</p>
            <p eId="para_10359">For the 2006 scheme, which I launched in May, I introduced a number of important changes, which followed a consultation process my Department had conducted with a range of community and voluntary groups.  One of the most important of these changes was to open the scheme for applications throughout the year.  Previously, there had been a set closing date for receipt of applications each year and this had resulted in the full annual batch of applications being received at the same time with an obvious impact on their processing.</p>
            <p eId="para_10360">While we are still at an early stage in the cycle of applications, it is clear that this change has already resulted in applications now being processed in weeks rather than months.  This change also allows groups to apply for funding under the scheme at any time throughout the year to address the needs of the older members of their communities as they arise.  Overall, I am confident that the open application process has been very well received by the local community and voluntary groups who administer this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_10361">Another change I introduced this year is the payment of an administration subvention to these voluntary groups who deal with the applications on behalf of the older people in the communities.  This is a recognition of the important work such groups do on an ongoing basis.</p>

Bíonn plé rialta ag oifigigh mo Roinne leis an Údarás faoin gcóras rialaithe seo.  Chomh maith leis sin, ar ndóigh, déanann an tArd-Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste cuntais Údarás na Gaeltachta a iniúchadh gach bliain agus leagtar cóip de na cuntais sin, maraon le tuarascáil bhliantúil na heagraíochta, faoi bhráid Thithe an Oireachtais.</p>

            <p eId="para_10631">Council Regulation (EC) 1 of 2005 on the protection of animals during transport harmonises EU rules on the transport and care of animals and will apply on a phased basis from January 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_10632">The Regulation provides for graduated rules in respect of the transport of animals for three categories of journeys: up to 65 kilometres; over 65 kilometres and under 8 hours, and long journeys over 8 hours. Farmers here will fall into the first two categories.</p>
            <p eId="para_10633">I am aware that in general Irish farmers and transporters operate to the highest animal welfare standards.  The new rules will specify the standards to be applied and they will be operated in a sensible manner that will ensure compliance with the legislation, no additional cost to farmers and no disruption to trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_10634">Basic minimum provisions relating to animal welfare will continue to be required in respect of the transport of animals regardless of duration.  For journeys up to 65km, farmers (or others) will not require any authorisation or specific training.</p>
            <p eId="para_10635">Persons transporting animals beyond 65km will have to be registered with the District Veterinary Office and from 2008 will have to demonstrate competence.  However, farmers using their own vehicles will not have to undergo any specific training as they will be deemed to have the required competence based on the levels of farmer training undertaken in Ireland, the approval process for herd numbers and the availability of a Department issued leaflet on animal transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_10636">There is scope in the Regulation to exempt certain activities from the general rules.  In this way the transport of animals to agricultural shows will be facilitated.</p>
            <p eId="para_10637">I am satisfied that properly regulated transport of animals plays an essential role in supporting both our indigenous farming activity on this island and our export trade in live animals.  I am also satisfied that Ireland will meet the requirements of the Regulation without imposing additional obstacles or costs on farmers or livestock marts.</p>

            <p eId="para_10652">Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 lays down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption. Household catering waste is classified as a low risk (Category 3) animal by-product for the purpose of the Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_10653">Composting and biogas plants using animal by-products must meet the requirements outlined in Chapter II, Annex VI of the Regulation, in relation to premises, equipment, microbiological testing, hygiene, processing standards, sampling, collection and transport of material.</p>
            <p eId="para_10654">Under Article 6 of S.I. 248 of 2003, the European Communities (Animal By-products) Regulations 2003 (as amended by S.I. 707 of 2005) which implements the above Regulation, I may grant an approval, attach conditions to an approval, revoke or vary a condition, withdraw an approval or refuse an application to operate a composting or biogas facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_10655">My Department has been phasing in the implementation of regulations in this area over the past two years, and interested bodies have been notified that 30 September 2006 is the deadline for formal approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_10656">The composting process involves the breakdown of organic material by microbes. Representative samples of the digestion residues or compost taken during or immediately after processing at a biogas or composting plant must comply with standards specified in Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 in relation to Escherichia coli and Enterococaceae. Representative samples of the digestion residues or compost taken during or on withdrawal from storage must comply with specified standards in relation to Salmonella.</p>
            <p eId="para_10657">Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 specifies standards and requirements relating to raw material particle size, and minimum processing temperature and time.  However in the case of a plant where catering waste is the only animal by-product to be used as a feedstock, other operating parameters may be accepted. The plant must produce documented evidence/research to guarantee an equivalent effect regarding the reduction of pathogens, unless the method employed is otherwise officially approved by the EU Commission as an acceptable alternative treatment method.</p>

These discussions are almost completed and the likely outcome is that Member States wishing to change the age limit for testing for BSE in healthy animal slaughtered for human consumption will have the opportunity to seek this in the context of requests which they can make for revisions to their annual monitoring programmes based on the improvement of the BSE situation of the country, on the basis of as yet to be agreed criteria and which may take some time to finalise.</p>

The suitability of the current tag and that recently selected for use in the Irish bovine identification system was determined by reference to a range of criteria designed to select an effective and secure identification and traceability system so that customers and consumers of Irish beef can be assured of the traceability of the product.</p>
            <p eId="para_10698">It is virtually impossible to guarantee that all tags inserted will remain in place indefinitely in a farming environment. The likelihood of tags remaining in place depends to some extent on their proper insertion in the animal's ears and in this regard improved insertion techniques have greatly assisted in maintaining identification of cattle in recent years. All farmers should follow the guidelines in relation to the insertion of tags in order that this is carried out in the safest and most effective manner possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_10720">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1183 and 1186 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_10721">The application of fertiliser in forestry is governed by the Code of Best Forest Practice, Forestry and Water Guidelines and Forestry and Aerial Fertilization Guidelines, all issued by the Forest Service of my Department.  These Guidelines, which reflect scientific findings and international good practice, set out requirements for permanent fertilizer-free buffer strips adjacent to waterways, methods of application, fertiliser formulation, rates and times of application and other stipulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_10722">A forest rotation in Ireland is typically 35 to 45 years or longer.  If phosphate fertiliser is required, it is typically applied at the time of initial afforestation at a rate of 250 kilogrammes of rock phosphate (14.5% Phosphorus) per hectare.  Rock phosphate is a slow release fertiliser.  On unenclosed land the maximum amount permitted at this time is 350 kilogrammes of rock phosphate per hectare.  In a minority of cases one or more additional applications may be necessary during the rotation.</p>
            <p eId="para_10723">As regards ‘hand fertilisation' or ‘manual application', this is the typical method used in the early life of a forest before it closes canopy, i.e. before the crop is circa 10 years of age.  This is well within the period for which premiums are paid by my Department.  After the forest closes canopy, the only practical way to apply fertiliser is by air and this requires specific approval from my Department.  In such cases, the maximum amount permitted is 350 kilogrammes of rock phosphate per hectare at a concentration of 11-16% Phosphorus.</p>

            <p eId="para_10725">The information required for felling licence applications is prescribed under legislation in accordance with the Forestry Act, 1946 (Part IV) Regulations, 1949 and is furnished by way of a Felling Application and Notice submitted by the landowner.</p>
            <p eId="para_10726">Part I of the Felling Notice contains particulars relating to the applicant and the land on which the trees stand together with a declaration of intention to replant and the extent of replanting to be undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_10727">Part II contains details of trees to be cut down including species, number and age of the trees together with an estimate of the value of the timber and reason for proposed cutting or uprooting.</p>

            <p eId="para_10729">In addition to the above, the application must also include a 6-inch Ordinance Survey map indicating the location of the plantation.  A separate report may also be required detailing the felling and replanting operations it is proposed to undertake.</p>
            <p eId="para_10730">The follow up inspection procedures for approval of licence applications include an assessment of the environmental considerations for the sites in question.  This can entail referral of the application to the various consultation bodies such as National Parks and Wildlife Service, Fisheries Boards and Local Authorities for their consideration and recommendations if applicable.  Any recommendations made are taken into account by the Forest Service in their decision to grant or withhold a licence.</p>

The EU has agreed that sugar beet will be eligible for aid under the scheme and may also be grown as an energy crop on set aside land.  At the February Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting I called for a review of the energy crop premium.  The EU Commission has just published a Report on implementation of the scheme since 2005 and on how the efficiency of the scheme could be further improved.  My Department is currently studying the Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_10752">I am confident that the recently announced Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme valued at €205m will help drive additional demand for the production of energy crops.  When fully operational in 2008, it will deliver some 163 million litres of biofuels per year and should result in Ireland achieving 2% market penetration of biofuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_10753">There has been renewed interest among some producers in growing miscanthus and willow as a feedstock for bioenergy purposes.  My Department has received a number of proposals for the introduction of establishment grants and these are currently being considered. The introduction of establishment grants will require EUapproval.</p>
            <p eId="para_10754">I am also working closely with Ministerial colleagues to promote the development of an indigenous biofuels sector in Ireland.  The Government have recently established a Ministerial Taskforce on Bioenergy to prepare a firm road map to develop Ireland's bioenergy resources to 2020.  This will ensure a cohesive approach to the development of bioenergy across Government Departments, state agencies and relevant stakeholders.  The Taskforce will prepare a comprehensive national Bio-energy Action Plan by the end of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_10761">Following the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme last year, farmers now have the freedom to choose whatever farming enterprise is most appropriate to their circumstances.  Under the agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime, the Single Payment Scheme is being extended to cover sugar beet compensation.</p>
            <p eId="para_10762">The sugar reform agreement also provides for the introduction of aid for diversification measures where sugar beet production completely ceases.  This aid, worth almost €44m, would be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme.  Under the Commission implementing regulation, Ireland will be required to submit the restructuring programme to the Commission by the end of thisyear.</p>
            <p eId="para_10763">I am aware there has been renewed interest among farmers in growing energy crops as a feedstock for bioenergy purposes following the closure of the sugar industry.  The key issue for farmers considering energy crops, as an alternative crop, is the expectation of a good economic return.  In this context, the Government announced in the last budget, an expanded excise relief scheme valued at €205m to stimulate the demand for biofuels.  At farm level, support by way of a premium of €45 per hectare is currently available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme.  I called last February for the premium to be reviewed and the EU Commission undertook to review the operation of the scheme.  Last week, the Commission published a Report on the implementation of the scheme, which my Department is examining.</p>
            <p eId="para_10764">I believe the development of an indigenous bioenergy industry would not alone create new opportunities for farmers to diversify into growing energy crops and other forms of renewable energy, but is important for environmental and energy supply reasons.  A Ministerial Taskforce has been established to oversee preparation of a National Bioenergy Strategy by end 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_10768">There is considerable potential for the use of forestry-based biomass, such as thinnings, as a source of renewable energy.  A pilot study is underway in Co. Clare, with funding from my Department, on the feasibility of establishing a locally-based wood fuel economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_10769">COFORD, the National Council for Forest Research and Development, is conducting trials on the harvesting, chipping and transport of forest biomass, under the ‘Forest Energy 2006' banner.  The overall objective is to demonstrate ways to produce high quality wood chip fuel from forest plantations, suitable for the heating and/or power generation sectors.  In conjunction with the trials, field demonstrations of harvesting equipment and techniques have been held at six locations, in collaboration with Teagasc forestry staff.  These have attracted many hundreds of forest owners and contractors. Bord na Móna has also been involved in the programme of work, through the investigation of wood chip transport and roading logistics.  Results from the trials, in terms of machine productivity, thinning systems, fuel quality and logistics are currently being collated and will be presented at a COFORD conference in December.</p>
            <p eId="para_10770">COFORD has also commissioned work on the potential supply of forest biomass from thinnings and other sources.

            <p eId="para_10866">The Report of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources made a number of recommendations under the theme of ‘Sustainable Energy Policy' to support the production of biofuels in Ireland.  This included a recommendation that the possibility of providing state assistance to encourage the conversion of the Mallow sugar factory to bioenthanol production should be investigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_10867">The Council Regulations mentioned by the Deputy give effect to the reform of the EU sugar regime which was agreed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in November 2005 after protracted and difficult negotiations.  One of the regulations, Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006, governs the EU restructuring scheme for the sugar industry.  Restructuring, in this context, refers to the abandonment of sugar quota production and the allocation of restructuring aid to the affected processors, growers and machinery contractors.  The maximum rate of restructuring aid is available where a sugar quota is renounced and the redundant sugar plant is fully dismantled.  However, the regulation also provides an option to apply for a reduced rate of aid (75%) where a sugar plant is to be partially dismantled and used for non-food purposes, such as bioethanol production.  The availability of this option reflects the fact that the EU Commission is favourably disposed towards the conversion of former sugar plants for biofuel production.  However, a decision on which option to pursue is entirely a matter for the sugar processor concerned.  Greencore has already submitted an aid application which involves full dismantling of the Mallow plant.  The Carlow plant, which closed early in 2005, is not covered by the restructuring scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_10880">The EU rural development support framework forms part of the common agricultural policy.  I believe that it is a very important element of that policy and that the priorities identified for the forthcoming programming period are the correct ones.  These cover the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sectors, the environment and the countryside, and quality of life and diversification of economic activity.  Within each priority, there is a range of possible support measures available to member states.  This approach affords a necessary element of choice without detracting from the overall priorities.  It is also worth noting that the rural development support framework is designed to complement other support mechanisms available in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_10881">In liaison with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, my Department is currently finalising a draft rural development programme for 2007 to 2013.

            <p eId="para_10895">Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, manufacturers and importers of farm plastics — that is, silage bale wrap and sheeting — are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market, or alternatively to contribute to and participate in compliance schemes to recover the waste in question.

As part of this process, and in relation to the registration of post-primary teachers, the Teaching Council has continued to operate with the same regulations that were used by the Registration Council.  These regulations are set out in my Department's publication: "General Information on Post-Primary Teaching in the Republic of Ireland including Teacher Qualification Requirements".</p>
            <p eId="para_10939">This publication outlines the criteria for the registration of teachers in voluntary secondary schools as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_10953">As Minister for Education and Science I am always concerned for the general welfare of children and any negative experience that interferes with a child's potential for learning is of particular concern to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_10954">The Department issued new child protection guidelines to primary schools in
         2001 and to post-primary schools in 2004.  These guidelines, which are based on
         the Department of Health and Children national guidelines Children First, set
         out the steps to be followed by a school in dealing with allegations or
         suspicions of child abuse.  The Guidelines state that the protection and
         wellbeing of the child is the most important consideration in dealing with such
         cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_10955">The Children First guidelines for schools require each board of management to
         designate a senior member of staff, normally the principal, as the Designated
         Liaison Person (DLP) for the school.  The DLP acts as a liaison person with the
         health authorities and other agencies on child protection issues and as a
         resource person to any staff member who has concerns in this regard.  Where
         there are reasonable grounds for an allegation or suspicion of child abuse, the
         school DLP should report the matter without delay to the Health Services
         Executive (HSE) which has statutory responsibility for child protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_10956">The Department has provided an extensive in-service training programme for
         school principals and teachers to assist them in dealing with child protection
         issues and in implementing the Department guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_10957">The teaching of a personal safety programme to ensure child protection is now

            <p eId="para_10961">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at
         both primary and post-primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the
         current school year there are no less than 4,000 extra teachers in our primary
         schools, compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is
         24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including
         resource teachers etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_10962">Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more
         support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</p>
            <p eId="para_10963">Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government,
         recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the
         expansion of free education.  Over the next two school years even more teachers
         will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and
         special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing
         schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_10964">As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one
         classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or
         two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for
         just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is
         at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next year
         (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom
         teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_10965">A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has
         been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school
         year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced
         specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each
         year, as is the case in many schools.  Some 170 such posts were sanctioned in the
         2005/06 school year, compared to 105 in 2004/05.</p>
            <p eId="para_10966">This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our
         schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_11115">The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.  The relevant circular (0023/2006) issued to all schools in March 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_11116">Under the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for the allocation of an additional post where a school experiences rapid growth in its enrolment.  In such cases, an additional post, referred to as a developing school post, may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.  Application(s) for an additional post(s) under developing school criteria must be submitted on or before 10 October, 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_11117">The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy on 30th September 2005 was 325 pupils, which warrants a staffing of a Principal and 12 mainstream class teachers for the 2006/2007 school year.  The school also has the 3 learning support/resource teaching posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_11118">To ensure transparency and openness in the system an independent Appeals Board is now in place to decide on any mainstream staffing appeals.  The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Primary Circular 0024/2006, which is available on my Department's website.  The closing date for receipt of appeals for the next Appeals Board meeting is 18th October 2006.</p>

These criteria apply to all the Maintenance Grant Schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_11182">An approved course for the purpose of the Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full time postgraduate course of not less than one year's duration pursued in an approved institution.

The schemes also provide that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification.</p>
            <p eId="para_11183">Notwithstanding this condition, candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are progressing to a further postgraduate course which represents progression from the level at which the previous postgraduate qualification(s) was attained, may be deemed eligible for grant aid.</p>

            <p eId="para_11193">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_11194">The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation
         in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my
         Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the
         Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_11195">As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to
         participate in the SSP.  These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town
         schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_11196">A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did
         not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regarded
         themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to
         warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the
         direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant
         identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of
         schools applying for a review.</p>
            <p eId="para_11197">An application for review was received from the school referred to by the         Deputy  and was thoroughly examined by the Review Group.  In accordance with the         recommendations of the Review Group, the school has not been identified for         inclusion in the School Support Programme and the Principal was informed by         letter on 4th August.</p>
            <p eId="para_11198">Schools which have not qualified for the new School Support Programme and which
         are receiving additional resources, both human and financial, under
         pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing concentrated disadvantage,
         will retain these supports for 2006/2007.  After that, schools will continue to
         get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_11199">The DEIS action plan states that, as well as the provision being made under the
         new School Support Programme for schools with a concentrated level of
         disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other
         primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.</p>

            <p eId="para_11201">At primary level it is a matter for each Local Authority to provide a library service for schools in its area.  While my Department has no involvement in the actual operation of this service, it does make a grant available to each Local Authority on an annual basis to enable Local Authority Librarians select, purchase, and deliver books to the primary schools in its area.  The grant is based on the number of pupils enrolled in primary schools in each Local Authority area.  Expenditure on the library grant at primary level was €2.07 million in the current year.  Further increases in the level of the grant in future years will be considered as part of the normal estimates process.</p>
            <p eId="para_11202">In Decmber, 1998, as part of a special literacy initiative £3.997m was disbursed to primary schools by way of a once-off library grant.  All primary schools received £1,000 under the scheme with an additional £2,170 per school allocated to schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  A second grant issued to all primary schools in December, 1999 as part of the national reading initiative. Under the terms of this grant primary schools received a payment of £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £462 was issued to all schools with 60 pupils or less.  The total value of these two grants was approximately £7.7 million (€9.8 million).</p>
            <p eId="para_11203">At post-primary level my Department provides a library of 100 metres squared in schools with an enrolment of 200-499 students while it provides 136 metres squared of accommodation for a library in schools with more than 500 students. Schools below 200 are examined individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_11204">Responsibility for the stocking of post-primary school libraries falls to be met by individual school authorities from within normal school budgets.  In recent years two grants have issued to post-primary schools in the Free Education Scheme to assist them with the development of their library resource materials.  The first grant, which amounted to £2,500 or £5,320 in the case of disadvantaged schools, was called a library grant and was issued by my Department in December, 1998.  A second grant issued to all post-primary schools in December, 1999 as part of the national reading initiative. Post-primary schools received £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £1,540  was paid to all schools with less than 200 recognised pupils.  Total expenditure on these two grants amounted to £5.2 million (€6.6million).</p>
            <p eId="para_11205">Schools were informed that the grants were to be used to improve the range and quality of library books and an information note offering advice on book purchases was issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_11206">Under the Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP) new school libraries were set up in 11 participating post-primary schools for students up to Junior Certificate.  The libraries are staffed by full-time qualified librarians. Reinforcing the concept of the whole-school approach to tackling literacy problems, the 11 schools were asked to draw up and implement library based strategies to tackle the literacy difficulties experienced by many JCSP students.  On the basis of positive evaluation findings the project is being extended on a phased basis to additional schools participating in the Programme.</p>

         has recently been rezoned by the local authority for educational use.  This
         proposal is being considered by my officials at present.  When a final decision
         is taken on the site for the school, the building project required to
         facilitate delivery of the school building will be considered in the context of
         the School Building and Modernization programme 2006 — 2010.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_11233">My Department provides a range of supports to second level school management to enable schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs including the needs of pupils with autism.  The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_11234">As the Deputy is aware, there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_11235">At second level, approximately 1,820 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs.  This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils.  In addition, there are 533.50 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,319 whole time equivalent special needs assistants (SNAs) in our second level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_11236">With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision.  The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005.  The Council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_11237">The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_11238">The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_11239">Deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_11240">Deciding on applications for special needs assistant (SNA) hours;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_11241">Processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_11242">My Department supports the education of individual students with autism in various second level schools throughout the country.  The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved.  Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support.  In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response.  Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios.</p>
            <p eId="para_11243">In recent years, my Department has supported the establishment of a number of special classes for pupils with autism in mainstream post primary schools.  The organisation of such provision is a significant task of the National Council for Special Education. Special classes are currently in operation in a number of post primary schools throughout the country including schools in Fairview and Finglas in Co. Dublin.  Discussions are ongoing between the NCSE and a number of other post primary schools with a view to establishing further classes of this nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_11244">The NCSE, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome.  It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_11245">In addition, my Department's Teacher Education Section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs.  This involves a major expansion of the range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to support schools staff locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_11246">My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs.  I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require.</p>

            <p eId="para_11257">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1285, 1320, 1326, 1395, 1406 and 1409 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_11258">The OECD Report examined changes in expenditure since the mid-1990s.  It shows that expenditure on education in Ireland has increased substantially between 1995 and 2003 at all levels, even when allowing for inflation.  I am pleased to say that investment in education has also increased substantially since 2003, the financial year indicated in the OECD Report referred to by Deputies.</p>
            <p eId="para_11259">According to data provided by my Department, per pupil expenditure in Ireland at primary level has increased by 16% from €4,567 in 2003 to €5,300 in 2005 (and by 96%, from €2,706 in 1997).  At second level per pupil expenditure has increased by 11% from €6,605 in 2003 to €7,347 in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_11260">With regard to staffing, major improvements have been made at both levels in recent years.  There are 4000 more teachers in our primary schools now than there were in 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level- including resource teachers etc.  The mainstream staffing schedule for primary schools was improved this year and the Government has committed to hiring extra teachers to improve primary school staffing even further in the 2007/08 school year.  At second-level there is now one teacher for 13 students.</p>
            <p eId="para_11261">Indeed, with the thousands of extra teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.</p>
            <p eId="para_11262">Day to day funding for our schools has also increased significantly in recent years.  Since the financial year referred to in the OECD report — 2003 — second-level schools have benefited from substantial increases in funding.  The standard capitation grant of €266 per pupil in 2003 now stands at €298 per pupil from 1 January last.  In addition, the support services grant for secondary schools has been increased from €127 per pupil in 2003 to €159 per pupil from January last.  This per capita grant is in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to some €15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_11263">Similarly at primary level, schools have benefited from substantial increases in funding since 2003.  The standard capitation grant has increased from €111.58 per pupil in 2003 to €145.58 from 1st January, 2006 while the Ancillary Services grant has been increased from €127 in 2003 to €139 in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_11264">These significant increases in the funding and staffing of schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_11291">As previously outlined to the Deputy, it is my Department's policy to ensure that schools in an area can between them cater for all pupils seeking places.  This not alone maximises the use of available accommodation in the interest of tax payer expenditure but also ensures that no school is developed to the detriment of another.  Schools are expected to implement enrolment policies to underpin this position.</p>
            <p eId="para_11292">With regard to the school concerned, and consistent with the policy outlined, a decision was taken earlier this year not to provide it with extra accommodation because of the availability of vacant accommodation in schools within a reasonable distance namely: St. Anne's National School and Ard Mhuire National School.  This decision still stands.  The Department is replacing some substandard accommodation at the school in question and it awaits quotations from the school authority in this regard to progress the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_11293">My Department is aware that there are significant developments planned for the Tallaght area and it is liaising with South Dublin County Council regarding future school requirements for the area on this basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_11294">In this context, the Department has also requested the school to which the Deputy refers to submit an application for large scale capital investment which will be assessed in the context of the overall need of the area rather than on a piecemeal basis in the interests of meeting the long term needs of the community as a whole.</p>

            <p eId="para_11318">School authorities need to take account of Circulars SNA 15/05 and 0059/2006 which deal with contracts of employment and seniority issues for special need assistants.  The revised contract has regard to the fact that all newly approved special needs assistant posts are related to the special needs of one or more pupils in respect of whom the posts are sanctioned, and may be utilised by the school having regard to the needs of those pupils and the duties of the post.  The practice of issuing child specific contracts ceased at the end of the 2004/05 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_11319">I am of the view that it may be beneficial for a child with Asperger's syndrome to retain the same special needs assistant, but it is not necessarily a critical consideration in every case.  The best approach might be for the school management to prepare and manage change where such is inevitable.</p>

            <p eId="para_11321">The Deputy will be aware that in accordance with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education with effect from 2007/08 academic year.

            <p eId="para_11322">To effect this requires the introduction of a new statutory basis for the scheme to replace the existing arrangements which involve a mix of statutory and non-statutory administrative schemes.

The service may be reckoned following appointment to a permanent teaching post and is subject to the payment of appropriate pension contributions.  Arrangements are currently being made, following discussions with the INTO and having regard to recent pension reforms, for the reckonability of substitute service given prior to 1991, whether the teacher was qualified or unqualified at the time the service was given.  Similarly, it is proposed that service given in a temporary unqualified capacity will also be pensionable.

            <p eId="para_11349">The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_11350">The focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible, by way of permanent accommodation.  In order to reduce the amount of temporary/prefabricated accommodation at primary level and to upgrade existing facilities, two new initiatives, the Permanent Accommodation Initiative and the Small School Initiative, were launched in 2003 on a pilot basis.  The purpose of these initiatives was to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money as opposed to the provision of temporary accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_11351">The feedback has in general been very positive, the number of schools participating has increased year on year and many schools are anxious to be included.  In order to maintain this momentum I invited 210 schools to participate in these schemes in 2006.  This brings to 520 the number of schools invited to participate since 2003.  As a result of these schemes the amount spent on the purchase of prefabricated buildings has been significantly reduced.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_11386">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at both primary and post-primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4,000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_11387">Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_11388">As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_11389">A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in many schools.  170 such posts were sanctioned in the 2005/06 school year, compared to 105 in 2004/05.</p>
            <p eId="para_11390">At second level too major progress has been made.  The pupil teacher ratio fell from 16:1 to 13:1 during the period from 1996/97 to 2005/2006.  The reduction in the ratio was achieved through the creation of over 2000 additional posts and the retention of over 2100 posts which would otherwise have been lost due to the fall in enrolments.  This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_11392">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new action plan for educational inclusion will focus on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school through second-level education (3 to 18 years).  The action plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).</p>
            <p eId="para_11393">The aim of DEIS is not simply to give additional supports to schools serving the most disadvantaged communities, but rather to help support schools and their communities to achieve equality in terms of educational participation and outcomes in line with national norms.  DEIS is designed to ensure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities benefit from the maximum level of support available.  Over the years, no less than 8 separate schemes for disadvantaged primary schools have been put in place.  Some schools were benefiting from just one or two of these and others were benefiting from more.</p>
            <p eId="para_11394">The DEIS initiative is designed to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from a comprehensive package of supports, while ensuring that others continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.  As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the new School Support Programme.  These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_11395">The tables list all  833 schools who accepted the invitation to participate in the new Programme.  The schools are listed on a county basis as requested by the Deputy.  These documents are also published on my Department's website.  An additional 40 schools are currently being added to the overall number arising from the recent appeals process and the complete listing will be available on my Department's website shortly.</p>

The Preliminary Census results for 2006 are also of use in identifying, early on, broad trends in total population by country and local area.

            <p eId="para_13737">It is important for me as Minister for Education and Science to reiterate at the outset of this answer that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are available on my Department's website.  Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_13738">Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department's Website.  The prioritisation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_13739">NEPS provides assistance to all schools and school communities that experience critical incidents, regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them.  Also, in relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for Reasonable Accommodation in Certificate Examinations and responds to queries in relation to individual children from other sections of my Department and from the specialist agencies.  NEPS also provides a service to children with visual impairment irrespective of the schools which they attend.  The assignment of schools to psychologists in my Department's National Educational Psychological Service is subject to change for a variety of reasons, particularly at the beginning of each school year.  A number of factors are taken into account and these include the desirability of providing a direct NEPS service to the majority of schools identified in the DEIS policy, the retirement and the resignation of psychologists and other management considerations.</p>
            <p eId="para_13740">Four psychologists from NEPS have been assigned to the recently established National Behaviour Support Service.  These psychologists will be replaced from the current recruitment panel by the end of this year.  Four newly appointed psychologists have been appointed in September to the Mid West region and one other  to the South East region.  These psychologists will be assigned to schools following an induction period of two months.  A number of other appointments will be made a soon as possible.  The range of coverage for schools in the school year 2006/2007 with a direct service from NEPS will be available in November.</p>

            <p eId="para_13742">Our schools promote, support and encourage physical exercise in a range of ways.</p>
            <p eId="para_13743">The subject Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is part of the core curriculum for all pupils in primary schools and in the junior cycle of second level schools.  The SPHE curriculum offers particular opportunities, in an age-appropriate way, to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual.  It includes such issues as nutrition, and the importance of exercise and healthy lifestyles.</p>
            <p eId="para_13744">Physical education is also part of the curriculum and plays a key role not just in giving students an opportunity to exercise during the school day but also in encouraging a positive attitude towards physical activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_13745">At primary level, Physical Education is one of seven curriculum areas within the revised Primary School Curriculum which was introduced in 1999.  A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_13746">In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum.  The programme that each school delivers should be based on the Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable.  The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_13747">The Physical Education curricula at both primary and second level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available to schools vary.  Consequently, they offer a level of flexibility that allows each individual school to design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_13748">Apart from the formal curricula, schools can take a range of measures to encourage physical activity among students during the school day and many provide extensive, broad-based programmes of co-curricular physical activities that are highly rewarding for both pupils and teachers alike.  In particular, schools play a major role in nurturing and promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community.  Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland provide extensive opportunities for such participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_13749">There are no plans to extend the length of time for PE in schools.  This is not feasible in terms of the range of curricular options which must be facilitated, or the industrial relations and cost implications.  Together, the above initiatives ensure that children not only get opportunities to exercise at school but also learn about balanced nutrition and making good food choices.  Schools are playing their part in the battle to tackle childhood obesity.  However, it should be remembered that children only spend 20% of their time at school and that a healthy home environment is vital to ensuring that they do not suffer from obesity.</p>

         her views on the OECD report which shows Ireland’s percentage of GDP spent on secondary level education to be higher only than the Slovak Republic. 
        [29391/06]

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_1417">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_13758">As the Deputy will be aware, given the distinctive structure of the Irish economy and specifically, the comparatively high proportion of our GDP that is expatriated as profits of foreign direct investment enterprises, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is not a good indicator of the relative resources available in the case of Ireland.  For example, the difference in magnitude between Ireland's GDP and Gross National Income (GNI) was 18% in 2003.  This means that standardised expenditure data for Ireland would be higher if GNI (or GNP) were used instead of GDP.  For most OECD countries, however, the difference between GDP and GNI is negligible and the vast majority of other countries are quite happy to continue using GDP to standardise international data on expenditure.  Department of Education and Science expenditure on education in Ireland in 2003, the reference year used in the latest ‘Education at a Glance' report, represented 4.9% of Gross National Income.  This increased to 5.2% in 2005 (provisional).</p>
            <p eId="para_13759">The Deputy should also note that spending by my Department on second level education increased by 17% between 2003 and 2005.  In 2005 €2.7 billion was spent on second-level education, up from €2.3 billion in 2003 and €1.25 billion in 1997.  This Government has dramatically increased investment in education in recent years.  However, it is simplistic to just say that increasing spending will result in better outcomes as evidenced by the relatively poor educational outcomes of some high spending countries.  What we all wish to see is the resources targeted towards education being used to best advantage at all levels.</p>

            <p eId="para_13761">My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them to cater for students with special educational needs including children with hearing impairment.  The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_13762">As the Deputy is aware, there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.  At second level, approximately 1,820 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs.  This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils.  In addition, there are 533 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,319 whole time equivalent special needs assistants (SNAs) in our second level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_13763">With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from the Department of Education and Science in relation to special educational provision.  The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005.  The Council acts under the broad policy direction of the Department of Education and Science but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_13764">The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/special needs.  The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13765">Deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13766">Deciding on applications for special needs assistant (SNA) hours;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13767">Processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_13768">The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved.  Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support.  In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response.  Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios.  Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_13769">The NCSE, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome.  It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.  In the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, an additional allocation of 3.74 teaching posts and 3 special needs assistant posts has been granted to cater for the special educational needs of its pupils including the needs of the pupil in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_13770">Pupils with disabilities are encouraged to indicate this on their CAO application form.  The sole purpose of this is to allow Higher Educational Institutes to consider, in consultation with the pupil, any specific support needs the pupil may have.  Some Higher Education Institutes may also take account of such disabilities of specific learning difficulties in considering the provision of special admission procedures.  My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs.  I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require.</p>

            <p eId="para_13776">Significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools have been made in recent years.  In addition to the increases in the standard per capita grant that now stands at €298 per pupil from January last, voluntary secondary schools have benefitted additionally by the introduction of grants under the School Services Support initiative.  The standard support services grant that was increased to €107 from January 2006, has been enhanced in the case of voluntary secondary schools by a further €10 per pupil since January 2006 bringing the overall grant for such schools to €159 per pupil.  This enhanced grant of €52 per pupil is paid in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 (€44.44 per pupil) per annum that have also been approved for voluntary secondary schools.  Schools have considerable discretion as to how this funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils and schools.  My approach has clearly shown my commitment to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity highlighted by the voluntary school sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_13787">My Department provides funding to VECs to assist towards the childcare expenses of participants in certain further education programmes in order to facilitate the enrolment on these programmes of people for whom they were designed but who had been unable to enrol on them because of childcare responsibilities.  One of these further education programmes is the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS).  The other programmes are Youthreach and Senior Traveller Training.</p>
            <p eId="para_13788">The amount of grant that each VEC receives is determined by reference to the number of students it has enrolled on these programmes who require childcare assistance and the total amount provided to the Department for this purpose.  The administration and disbursement of these grants are matters for each VEC.  Students in the relevant programmes who feel entitled to such grants should apply to their VECs.</p>
            <p eId="para_13789">The funds provide for:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13790">direct provision of creche facilities in centres or in rented premises, including staff, equipment/refurbishment, rental, insurance and other overheads; or</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13791">the purchase of places in existing community or commercial creches.  This is subject to payment of a maximum of €63.50 per week per child for a full-day session, with pro-rata adjustments for sessions of lesser duration; or — the payment of childminders, subject to a maximum of €63.50 per child per week for a full session, with pro-rata adjustments for part-time sessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_13792">The grant is intended as a contribution to costs. VECs determine the level of childcare provision and have the discretion to bridge any gap between the Department's grant and actual costs they approve.  Expenditure by my Department on further education childcare grants to VECs has grown from €3.25m in 2001 to €5.45m in 2005.  The provision for 2006 is €5.69m.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_13794">Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_13795">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act.  In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful.  In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_13796">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level —  including resource teachers etc.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_13797">Under the staffing arrangements for primary schools, there is provision for the allocation of an additional post to a school where the school experiences rapid growth in its enrolment.  In such cases, an additional post, referred to as a developing school post, may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_13798">For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in areas of rapidly increasing population such as County Kildare.  170 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2005/06 school year, compared to 105 in 2004/05.  This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</p>

         her plans, to combat alleged increased incidents of school bullying; if she has received indications of bullying of pupils or students by their peers or the bullying of teachers by pupils or students; the structures currently available to deal with such issues; the number of occasions in which her Department has become aware of or directly involved in the matter in the past five years, notwithstanding the fact that no direct line of communication between her Department and the schools exists at present; if she will address the issue in the near future; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_1428">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_13800">I share the Deputy's concern that any child would feel upset in school because of bullying — be it physical, verbal or cyber and I assure him that supports are in place to enable schools both to prevent bullying and to deal with cases that may arise.  For a start, each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline.  Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_13801">My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.  My Department, through the National Centre for Technology in Education has also developed Policy Guidelines and Advisory Notes for schools and parents which deal with the issues of internet and mobile phone bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_13802">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is at present developing further guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  Work on the guidelines is at an advanced stage and will be informed by broad consultation.  It is envisaged that implementation will commence in the current school year.  Once the NEWB Guidelines are in place, my Department will commence the process of revising and updating its own "Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour".</p>
            <p eId="para_13803">This review will take into account issues such as legislative developments, the involvement of the support services available to schools, technological advancements such as use of the Internet, e-mail, mobile phones and camera phones and the latest developments in International best practice on dealing with bullying behaviour.  These guidelines, on top of those that are already in place, will provide vital guidance for schools in fulfilling their responsibilities in relation to this issue.  The Deputy may also be interested to know that dealing with bullying has also been incorporated in training for principals through the Leadership Development for Schools programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_13804">I have also stressed to the teacher unions the importance of not just having a written policy on bullying but also ensuring a climate in which it is not tolerated in any form and in which children know that if they make a teacher aware of bullying that it will be dealt with.  The Deputy will also be aware that the education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum.  SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_13805">In relation to the Deputy's query about reports to my Department, there is no requirement for schools to report incidents of bullying to my Department, nor do I believe that this should be the case.  Bullying must be tackled at local level.  While incidents of bullying are brought to my Department's attention from time to time, it would take an inordinate amount of time to compile the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the past five years.  Responsibility for tackling bullying naturally falls to the level of the individual school as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established.  I am, however, anxious to support schools in tackling bullying and it is for that reason that so many supports have been put in place in recent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_13837">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at both primary and post-primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_13838">Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_13839">As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that – with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_13840">A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in many schools.  170 such posts were sanctioned in the 2005/06 school year, compared to 105 in 2004/05.</p>
            <p eId="para_13841">At second level too major progress has been made.  The pupil teacher ratio fell from 16:1 to 13:1 during the period from 1996/97 to 2005/2006.  The reduction in the ratio was achieved through the creation of over 2000 additional posts and the retention of over 2100 posts which would otherwise have been lost due to the fall in enrolments.  This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_1441">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_13843">The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.  Liaison with existing schools is also an important part of the process, as the school authorities would usually alert my Department where, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.  In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity or provide new infrastructure where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_13844">Over and above the statutory consultation provisions in relation to draft area development plans, the Department has in recent years worked to strengthen contacts with local authorities to enable informed decisions to be made in planning future educational provision.  It's obvious that plans for new schools must be backed up by a significant structural programme and that the most urgent schools feature in a capital programme.  To achieve this, each application for capital funding is measured against published prioritisation criteria.  Under the criteria, projects in rapidly developing areas, such as Co. Kildare, are assigned a band 1 priority rating which is the highest priority possible.  This is clear evidence of my Department's commitment to ensuring that the needs of rapidly developing areas are met as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_13845">To underpin the prioritisation criteria, standard/generic designs have been developed by Building Section for 8 and 16-classroom schools to fast track delivery.  Use of these designs essentially means that the time spent on the traditional early stages of architectural planning has been removed and now, once a site has been acquired and is suitable, the plan can be submitted for planning permission after site orientation has been carried out.  Where a Generic Repeat Design is not suitable due to site restrictions, School Building Section can use the Design and Build approach to effect a fast delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_13846">My Department is also working proactively with some local authorities to explore the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities.  This enhanced cooperation has the effect of minimising the Department's land requirements and thus reducing site costs while at the same time providing local communities with new schools with enhanced facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_13847">Under the provisions of the Strategic Development Zones (SDZ) it is generally the position that sites must be reserved for schools and that the schools must be developed commensurate with housing and other developments such as community facilities.  This approach ensures that schools are delivered commensurate with housing developments and it one that should be considered for replication by local authorities up and down the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_13848">The Department has recently adopted an area based approach to school planning where, through a public consultation process involving all interested parties, a blueprint for schools' development in an area for a 10 year timeframe is set out.  The draft should be ready to go for public consultation in a matter of weeks.  The purpose of this new approach to school planning is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties in the locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_13849">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at both primary and post-primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</p>

The school was given approval to enrol two Junior Infant Classes per year and, when fully occupied, will operate as a two-stream 16-classroom school.  This incremental development is common to all newly established schools to ensure that a shortage of accommodation at the school is avoided by an over enrolment in the early stages and crucially, to ensure that the enrolments and staffing levels in other schools in the area, where older pupils would inevitably be drawn, are not adversely affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_13856">Notwithstanding this position and as an exceptional matter, the school authority has been given approval to enrol three junior infants classes for the 2006/07 school year only, on the grounds that this will not impact negatively on the other schools in question.  Approval has also been given to enrol an additional 40 pupils up the classes that could not obtain places in other schools in the area.  Pupils moving into the area in the course of the school year can also enrol in the school on the same basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_13873">The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works which acts on behalf of my Department in relation to site acquisitions generally was requested to source a site for a new national school in Kill.  Agreement has been reached, subject to contract, on the acquisition of a site for a new school at Kill, Co. Kildare.  Draft contracts have been exchanged but the conveyancing process is delayed by the vendor, pending the outcome of a planning application.</p>

            <p eId="para_13875">The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department.  However, if the Deputy wishes to request details on a specific school, my officials will provide the required information.  The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_13876">The focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible, by way of permanent accommodation.  In order to reduce the amount of temporary/prefabricated accommodation at primary level and to upgrade existing facilities, two new initiatives, the Permanent Accommodation Initiative and the Small School Initiative, were launched in 2003 on a pilot basis.  The purpose of these initiatives was to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money as opposed to the provision of temporary accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_13877">The feedback has in general been very positive, the number of schools participating has increased year on year and many schools are anxious to be included.  In order to maintain this momentum I invited 210 schools to participate in these schemes in 2006.  This brings to 520 the number of schools invited to participate schemes since 2003.  As a result of these schemes the amount spent on the purchase of prefabricated buildings has been significantly reduced.</p>

            <p eId="para_13881">Under my Department's Free Fees Initiative the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate courses in the State.  The Free Fees Initiative does not extend to postgraduate study in Ireland, however if a candidate qualifies for the means-tested maintenance grant he/she could have their fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of €5,730, for the 2006/07 academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_13882">Under the terms of my Department's Third Level Maintenance Grant Schemes, which are administered on behalf of the Department by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees, the position is that, generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  An approved course for the purpose of the Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and full time postgraduate course of not less that one year's duration pursued in an approved institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_13883">In relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation as per the consumer price index.  The reference period currently used is the increase in the period to December of the year prior to the relevant academic year.  An increase of 3% rather than the 2.5% in the December to December period was approved in respect of the ordinary rates of maintenance for 2006/07 academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_13884">The Special Rates of Maintenance Grant, usually referred to as "top-up" grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000/01 academic year.  The higher, non-adjacent special rate of maintenance is based on the maximum personal rate of Social Welfare Unemployment Assistance.  An increase of 22.5% in the ‘top-up' maintenance grant for 2006/07.  Students qualifying for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant will receive €5,970 in the 2006/07 academic year.  The higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable to all eligible mature students.</p>

            <p eId="para_13886">Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U. Member States and in non EU countries.  Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local Tax Offices or alternatively from Revenue's Internet site at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_13905">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.  The relevant circular (0023/2006) issued to all schools in March 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_13906">Under the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for the allocation of an additional post where a school experiences rapid growth in its enrolment.  In such cases, an additional post, referred to as a developing school post, may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.  Application(s) for an additional post(s) under developing school criteria must be submitted on or before 10 October, 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_13907">The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy on 30th September 2005 was 428 pupils, which warrants a staffing of a Principal and 15 mainstream staff teachers for the 2006/2007 school year.  The school also has the services of 2 disadvantaged concessionary posts, 3 learning support posts, 1 home school liaison post and 1 temporary post for non national pupils.</p>

            <p eId="para_13911">The Deputy will be aware of the enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers and other supports in our schools which are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.  I wish to assure the Deputy that I am most anxious that all children, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, receive an education appropriate to their needs.  It is in recognition of this that my Department currently provides the following facilities for the education of children with autism:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13912">159 Special Classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13913">15 pre-school classes</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13914">5 Special classes for children with Asperger's Syndrome</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13915">12 Stand-Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology.</p>
            <p eId="para_13916">I can confirm that I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education, ensure that all children with special needs are adequately resourced.</p>
            <p eId="para_13917">The litigation the Deputy refers to is brought not by the State but by parents seeking a particular form of provision for their child.  The State makes every effort to reach an accommodation with parents while having regard to their genuine concerns and wishes, Government policy, the best interests of the child and the expert advice available to it.  In the last 6 years, only 3 cases have gone as far as being ruled upon by the Courts, all of which the State successfully defended.  A 4th case is currently awaiting judgement.</p>
            <p eId="para_13918">To date in 2006 my Department has spent a total of approximately €454,680 on legal costs and settlements associated with court cases relating to educational provision for children with special needs compared to a total of approximately €1.6 million in 2005, €5.64 million in 2004 and €4.3 million in 2003.  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department is not complacent in dealing with these cases and it attempts, whenever possible, to reduce the potential for litigation and the levels of legal costs where litigation arises.  Quite often, however, the issue of the plaintiff's legal costs become a barrier to reaching a settled compromise.</p>
            <p eId="para_13919">The number of cases taken against the State is showing a downward trend and I believe that the establishment of the National Council for Special Education will further assist the reduction in litigation in providing through its special educational needs organisers, a more focused and local response to individual needs.  In addition, with the staged implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, parents who believe their child's needs are not being met will have a process of mediation and appeals open to them.  These are likely to prove more appropriate, and less costly, forums in the future than pursuing these matters through the courts.</p>

            <p eId="para_13930">Under the provisions of the Education Act, 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school.  In general, the Board has the responsibility to ensure that the school operates efficiently and effectively and also has responsibilities in relation to the action of its employees.  The Board must manage the staff in the school and intervene when it considers necessary to resolve matters relating to the actions of its employees.  The Board of Management is the employer and has similar powers to any other employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_13931">With regard to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, the Patron of the school dissolved the Board of Management in March, 2006 and, with my approval, appointed a single manager to manage the school for a period of six months in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Education Act, 1998.  I am aware that, since his appointment, the single manager has been making strenuous efforts to address the difficulties at the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_13932">The Patron has recently requested my approval for an extension of six months to the term of office of the single manager.

            <p eId="para_13951">Government commitment to the PLC sector, by reference to the resources applied in teachers' pay, non-pay running costs, student support and certification costs, is very significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_13952">We have increased the number of PLC places by 60% since 1996/97.  Indeed, the number of PLC places approved for 2005/2006 is up by more than 1,600 on the 2004/05 level.  The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188.</p>
            <p eId="para_13953">We also extended the provision of maintenance grants to PLC students with effect from September 1998.  The PLC maintenance grant scheme operates on the same basis as in higher education.  There were nearly 8,000 PLC grant holders in 2005 and they received some €23 million in direct support.  Tuition fees for PLC courses are also waived.</p>
            <p eId="para_13954">PLC students are included in the calculation of non-pay budgets issued to schools in respect of running costs.  A supplementary non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable.  This amounted to €5.5 million in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_13955">Other developments funded by my Department of direct benefit to the PLC sector include the provision of national certification under the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the development of progression links with higher education in the Institutes of Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_13956">The McIver Report contains 21 over-arching recommendations, incorporating 91 sub-recommendations.  It has been estimated, in consultation with management and staff interests, that the recommendations for staffing would involve at a minimum the creation of at least 800 new posts at a cost of over €48 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_13957">The recently published Towards 2016: Ten Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement  2006-2015 has noted that having regard to developments in the PLC sector, including the McIver report, concrete prioritised proposals in relation to PLC provision and focused in particular on the larger PLC providers will be prepared and will be the subject of further negotiations between management and unions.  The level of resources for the PLC sector will be determined in the light of resources generally and the implications for other areas of education.  Student numbers will be subject to audit on an ongoing basis.  The scope for rationalisation of provision will also be examined having due regard to ensuring appropriate provision on a geographic basis and the necessary critical mass for delivery of a quality education service.</p>

            <p eId="para_13967">The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary and post-primary level in any given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for school places.  Officials of my Department's School Planning Section meet on a regular basis with the Planning Department of South Dublin County Council with a view to identifying the need for additional educational provision and reserving sites for schools, where required.  As part of this process, my Department has received details from South Dublin County Council with regards to the proposed new Tallaght town centre, and in particular, details regarding the scale of development and its possible implications for the population of Tallaght.  A study of current capacity in existing primary and post-primary schools was also  undertaken in the Department and arising from this, a submission has been made on estimated school site and school requirements for inclusion in the local area plan.  My Department has requested that two sites be reserved for the provision for four additional primary schools.  Owing to the level of spare capacity in existing Post-Primary schools in the area, my Department is not proposing additional post-primary provision at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_13969">The Higher Education Grant Schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  Under the terms of these Acts a mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on the 1st of January of the year of entry to their third level course.  Under the terms of the Higher Education Grants Schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents.  An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.  Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</p>
            <p eId="para_13970">My Department understands that the student in question has been resident in America from August 2004 to April 2006.  Accordingly, she is ineligible under the terms of the Higher Education Grant Scheme to be assessed as an independent mature candidate or a dependent mature candidate as she fails to meet the residency requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_13971">Clause 4.1.1 of the Higher Education Grant Scheme states that the candidate's parents or guardians, or in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate herself/himself, shall be ordinarily resident in the administrative area of the Local Authority from 1 October 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_13973">Officials in the School Planning Section of my Department have not been made aware of any shortage of places in post-primary provision in Swords.</p>
            <p eId="para_13974">My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places.  This may result in pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_13975">Swords is an area of population growth and while there may be a demand in future years for additional provision at post primary level, the Department is satisfied that, between them, the four existing post primary schools has adequate provision to cater for current demand.  There is, therefore, no obligation on patents to queue for school places, this is done as a matter of choice — a point which has been reflected in media coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_13976">Officials in the School Planning Section of my Department are carrying out a review of educational needs in the North Dublin/East Meath/South Louth area (including Swords) by way of a Draft Area Development Plan.  The need for additional future post primary provision in Swords is being considered in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_13977">The Draft Plan is nearing completion and will be published shortly.  Following this, a public consultation process will be conducted by the Commission on School Accommodation.  The process will culminate in a final Area Development Plan which will provide a blueprint for educational infrastructure in the area for the next decade including the need or otherwise to provide additional post primary school provision in Swords.</p>
            <p eId="para_13978">The school referred to by the Deputy has an application with my Department for major capital funding.  The application, which is for ancillary accommodation and not to increase the capacity of the school, has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and progress on the project will be considered in the context of the overall educational plan for the Swords area.</p>

            <p eId="para_13980">The specific information requested in relation to class size at post primary is not readily available within my Department.  However, in relation to teacher allocations for second level schools the following is the general position.</p>
            <p eId="para_13981">Allocations are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment.  In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post leaving Cert courses and Leaving Cert Applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_13982">Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils' needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation.  Significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years.  The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 13:1 in the 2005/06 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_13983">The rules for allocating teaching posts provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet essential curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support.</p>
            <p eId="para_13984">An independent Appeals Committee is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.</p>

            <p eId="para_13994">In-service training has been provided in recent years to support the introduction of new curricula in Junior Certificate Science and in Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology.  The number of teachers who received training and amount of money expended on such training are included in the attached table.  In relation to the expenditure, it should be noted that the table includes the direct costs of providing training which excludes the salaries of teachers seconded from schools to work on these in-service programmes.  It is not possible to provide this information within the time-scale for the Deputy's questions but this information can be provided by my officials at a later stage directly to the Deputy if she requires it.</p>
            <p eId="para_13995">The statistics provided in respect of Physics, Chemistry and Biology refer in some cases to multiple in-service events held during the relevant year.  The intensive phase of the Physics and Chemistry support programmes concluded in August 2003 at which time they came under the auspices of the SLSS (Second Level Support Service).  The intensive phase of Biology was completed in August of 2004.</p>

            <p eId="para_13999">The Deputy will be aware that my Department is engaged in the roll-out of broadband internet connectivity to all recognised primary and post-primary schools.  This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry following the establishment of a three year €18m joint Government — IBEC/TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) Fund to provide local broadband connectivity to schools.  The broadband connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network supported by HEAnet, which will provide managed Internet access, email, security controls, content filtering and other services designed to enhance the educational process.  A Broadband Support Service Desk has also been established to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network.  The total cost of the project for the three year period will be in the region of 30m.</p>
            <p eId="para_14000">Following a public tendering process, contracts were finalised in 2005 with six Service Providers for the provision of local access connectivity to 3,925 schools and with a further Provider for the installation of a broadband router at school level where appropriate.  The count of the number of schools countenanced under this arrangement has since been amended to take into account the effect of a number of school closures, amalgamations and new opening and stands currently at 3,936.  As of Friday 22nd September last some 3,684 of these schools were fully installed with broadband under this process, some 50 others had a partial installation in place.  Of the remainder, some 19 schools, as yet to be accommodated under the programme, had a locally organised broadband connection.  In addition to the above some 72 school have been provided with broadband connectivity separately by my Department under two pilot projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_14447">I understand that this question relates to pension increases due to retired civilian employees of my Department.  I should explain that the Office of the Paymaster General, Department of Finance, is responsible, upon the receipt from my Department of the pension rate in each particular case, for the payment of pensions to retired employees.  Over the past number of months, my Department has undertaken a review of the rates of pension paid to retired civilian employees.  The need for the review arose because of a circular issued by the Department of Finance outlining a revised formula for the calculation of pension rates.  This is a time-consuming process, where the level of pension awarded to each retired civilian employee has to be re-calculated.</p>
            <p eId="para_14448">To ensure that this major undertaking was completed as soon as possible, additional staff were assigned for a number of months to work on a dedicated basis in this area.  In many cases, the review has resulted in increased levels of pension being awarded to the retired employees.  In addition, the opportunity has been taken to apply the benefits of any outstanding pay agreements to the levels of pension.  At this stage, the review of a majority of the cases has been completed and the revised rates for the pensioners concerned have been notified to the Office of the Paymaster General for payment.  It is anticipated that the review of the pension rates awarded to the remaining pensioners will be completed shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_14466">The two principal organisations officially recognized by my Department and the Defence Forces as being representatives of retired Defence Forces personnel are: the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and Women Teo. (ONET), which represents all ranks of retired Defence Forces personnel and provides support such as sheltered accommodation for ex-service personnel; and the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA), which represents all retired military personnel who have served on United Nations duty overseas and celebrates all United Nations commemorative occasions.  Her Excellency, An tUachtarán is patron of ONET.</p>
            <p eId="para_14467">A third organisation, the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers (ARCO), which represents retired commissioned Officers  countrywide, although not officially recognised, is very active in supporting the Cadet School as well as other activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_14468">These organisations have proven themselves to be responsible in their dealings with the Defence Forces, the Department of Defence and other Government Departments and represent their members in a very capable manner.  The official recognition of a limited number of organisations greatly facilitates the two-way flow of information between ex-servicemen and women on the one hand and the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces on the other, and prevents needless overlap and duplication.</p>
            <p eId="para_14469">I have sought the views of the Defence Forces, and the position is that it is considered inadvisable to afford official recognition to a multiplicity of local/regional/specialist organisations as this would create difficulties that would be detrimental to all concerned in the longer term.</p>
            <p eId="para_14470">I understand from the military authorities that, notwithstanding this, ONET is willing to discuss the affiliation of any other organisations who may wish to represent ex-service personnel from specific geographical areas, or from special service categories or groups.  Affiliation would ease the interaction between those being represented and the Department and the Defence Forces, while also allowing the affiliating organization to benefit from the vast experience of ONET.</p>
            <p eId="para_14471">The existence of a large number of organisations operating independently would be detrimental to maintaining coherent and effective contacts with the Department and Defence Forces over time.  A system of affiliation would allow organisations to pursue their own specific aims within the overall ambit of ONET in a more effective manner, using the experience of that umbrella organisation.  This course of action has been recommended to a number of organizations that have previously requested official recognition.  It is not intended to change this policy.</p>

At the request of the relevant agencies, Irish Water Safety undertakes risk assessments at waterways, both inland and coastal, and advises on appropriate safety measures which would include the provision of ring buoys.</p>

No discrepancy or source of inaccuracy has been found in completion figures in 2005, nor is there any need to change the method of calculation for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_14561">An issue that has arisen in relation to the data, is the use of house completions as a measure of residential construction activity.  I am aware that these data are used by economists, and the Central Statistics Office, as a measure of the level of activity and value added from housing construction.  In April 2006, the CSO contacted my officials to query the data published for 2005 as they considered that growth in construction employment suggested that the level of residential construction activity should be higher than the house completion data indicated (albeit that 2005 was a further record year for house completions with almost 81,000 units completed).</p>
            <p eId="para_14562">On foot of enquiries to the ESB, it emerged that the ESB had experienced longer delays in meeting the demand for connections than in previous years.  The ESB estimated that there was a higher level of work-in-progress than usual, of about 5,200 units over the course of 2005, which we have been advised was cleared during the course of the first half 2006.  These units were not completed and not available, and could not be counted as house completions, but the information was relevant in looking at trends in housing activity.  Therefore, we provided this information publicly at the earliest possible time, which was when I released the house completions figures for the first 5 months 2006 on 10 July 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_14563">As I have indicated at the outset, the ESB connections series reflects the number of homes completed and does not include work-in-progress and there are no plans to make any changes to this series.</p>

            <p eId="para_14567">The National Climate Change Strategy set out a policy framework to enable Ireland meet its International obligations to address climate change, and comprises a comprehensive programme towards achieving the necessary greenhouse gas emissions reductions across all sectors of our economy including transport and energy, which are primarily responsible for the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_14568">I recently launched a report on the implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy, entitled Ireland's Pathway to Kyoto Compliance.  Copies of the report are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The report provides the basis for a public consultation, which will inform the preparation of a revised National Climate Change Strategy.  The report shows that at least 8 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions will be removed through policies and measures already in place over the period for compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, 2008-2012.  This reduces, by more than half, the gap to Ireland's Kyoto target identified in the National Climate Change Strategy.  There are three strands to the Government's approach to achieving the further reductions needed to bridge the remaining distance to target: emissions reductions, or purchase of carbon allowances, by installations participating in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme; use of the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms by the Government to purchase credits for carbon reductions elsewhere in the world; and measures to reduce emissions throughout the economy, in addition to those set out in the National Climate Change Strategy and those introduced subsequently.</p>
            <p eId="para_14569">I have published the recent updated report to permit consultation on a range of options for Ireland to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions even further.  The more measures Ireland puts in place now, the more we will be able to reduce our emissions between now and 2012 and the better prepared we will be to take on potentially more demanding targets beyond 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_14570">The public consultation on the review of the National Climate Change Strategy will run until 30 September. The Government will publish a revised National Climate Change Strategy before the end of 2006.  I am confident that Ireland will meet its Kyoto targets.  At an international level, Ireland also supports the proactive position of the European Union on achieving the ultimate objective stated in Article 2 of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>

            <p eId="para_14580">There are various general legislative provisions applicable to noise nuisance, as well as a number of practical arrangements to reduce the instances of unnecessary noise from alarms and to tackle persistent incidence of such noise.</p>
            <p eId="para_14581">Section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides local authorities with powers to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise.  In the case of a faulty alarm, a local authority may serve a notice under this section.  Where the Council receives a complaint, an advisory letter is issued to the owner/occupier advising of the terms of the current standards for intruder alarms systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_14582">A European Standard for external intruder alarms (EN50131) has replaced all national standards, and incorporates considerably stricter controls, regarding minimum and maximum duration for the sounding of alarms.  The new limits are 90 seconds minimum and 15 minutes maximum duration from the sounding of external alarms in buildings; the alarms must cease automatically after the maximum duration.  This standard has been applied by the National Standards Authority of Ireland for intruder alarms installed by certified installers since 1 March 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_14583">The Private Security Services Act 2004 provided for the establishment of a Private Security Authority to licence, control and supervise all alarm installers of security equipment, and for the Authority to have powers to maintain and improve standards in the provision of services, including standards for intruder alarms.  I understand that with effect from 1 November 2005, installers of alarms were required to register with the Private Security Authority and with effect from 1 August 2006, installers cannot operate without a licence, the granting of which will require proof that the installer has attained the EN 50131 standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_14584">In addition, I understand that the connection of monitored business intruder alarm systems to Garda Síochána stations is contingent upon, inter alia, the use of alarm systems which are certified by the NSAI and installed by certified installers.  The current European Standard along with improved equipment and the co-operation of the installers certified by the NSAI, should together ensure that the incidence of false alarms and the failure of audible alarms to cut off will be significantly reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_14585">Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994, a local authority or any person may seek an order in the district court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.  A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available from my Department or on <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</p>

A quarry which commenced pre-1964 but intensified operations post 1964 to the extent that there could be said to have been a material change of use will also require planning permission.  Similarly, in a case where a quarry commenced pre 1964 but the use was abandoned post 1964, planning permission is required for a re-commencement of operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_14588">Section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which was commenced in April 2004, introduced a new registration system for quarries.  All quarries except those which obtained planning permission in the 5 years before the commencement of the section were required to register with the planning authority by 27 April 2005 and those quarries failing to comply become unauthorised development regardless of their previous status.  Following registration a planning authority may restate, modify or add to conditions on the operation of a quarry that has received planning permission more than 5 years ago or may require certain pre 1964 quarries to seek planning permission and if necessary to submit an environmental impact statement.  Under Section 261(7) of the Act, a planning authority must require a quarry which is pre-1964, is greater than 5 hectares and would be likely to have significant effects on the environment, to apply for planning permission and to submit an environmental impact statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_14589">A small number of quarries, principally quarries directly associated with activities which are, in their own right, subject to Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control licensing or quarries from which material with significant mineral content is extracted, are currently licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Environmental Protection Agency Acts 1992 and 2003.</p>

These include in particular the enactment of the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003, which addressed a number of legislative changes called for in the Review.  In addition, a new Framework for Major Emergency Management, on which local authority, Health Service Executive and Garda Síochána Major Emergency Plans are based, has been issued and this will be implemented over the next two years in accordance with a programme approved by the Government.

This Programme sets out the strategy for the future development of the fire service and includes measures addressing the development of community fire safety programmes, the development of a risk based approach to the determination of fire cover standards, the introduction of a competency-based approach to recruitment, retention and career progression in the fire service and the enhancement of health, safety and welfare programmes within the fire service.  Work on the Change Programme is being carried out by a dedicated Project Team and is progressing satisfactorily.  My priority under the Fire Services Change Programme is to use the available resources to bring about direct improvements in these key areas of the fire service rather than prioritising purely institutional changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_14625">Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this.  In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider.  Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  I have asked local authorities to engage with commercial waste collectors to agree on arrangements to assist lower-income households by offering alternative payment methods to an annual lump-sum.</p>
            <p eId="para_14626">I have recently published a consultation paper on the possible economic regulation of the waste sector.  Submissions have been invited on whether there is a need for a regulator for the sector, on what model of regulator might be most appropriate and on what powers any such regulator should be given.  Among the possible powers discussed in the paper is the power to impose a public service obligation.  This is a feature of regulation in some other sectors, and effectively requires contractors to operate cross-subsidisation so that services can be provided where they would not otherwise be economically feasible.  Submissions in response to the consultation paper are being taken until October 6, and I will then consider what policy proposals to bring to Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_14679">Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may include in their development plans objectives regulating, restricting or controlling development in areas at risk of flooding.  Where development is proposed in an area at risk of flooding, it is a matter for each planning authority to evaluate such risk, on the basis of a flood risk assessment where appropriate and planning permission may either be refused, or, if granted, can be made subject to conditions requiring the implementation of measures necessary to alleviate or avoid damage due to flooding.</p>
            <p eId="para_14680">Draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on the preparation of Development Plans were published for public consultation last April.  These draft Guidelines advise that, in addressing the issue of flooding, development plans should identify areas that experience or are at risk from flooding, drawing from the process of flood risk mapping currently being undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  Local development plan policies should then outline the considerations that will arise in relation to development within or near such areas from the point of view of managing existing flood risks or avoiding the generation of new flood risks.</p>
            <p eId="para_14681">The draft Guidelines also suggest that development plan policies dealing with flooding also need to recognise the uncertainties inherent in the prediction of flooding and the fact that flood risk is expected to increase as a result of climate change.  Development plan objectives could also include policies indicating that developers will be required to support the funding of flood defences needed for particular developments, either partially or fully, depending on the circumstances involved.  It is expected that the Guidelines will be finalised in the near future.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_14693">The Government have taken action on a wide front to maximise access to home ownership, particularly through measures to promote adequate supply of housing to meet very strong demand.  In addition, we have supported first time buyers through a range of targeted measures, notably affordable housing schemes, tax reliefs and stamp duty reduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_14694">The delivery of over half a million new homes since 1997 has enabled an unprecedented number of first time buyers to access home ownership during the period.  Almost 81,000 houses were built in 2005 compared to less than 31,000 ten years ago.  In the first seven months of 2006, 51,752 houses and apartments were completed nationally.  This represents an increase of 23.6% on the corresponding period in 2005.  Supply in Dublin has also increased significantly.  18,000 new homes were completed last year, double the output of ten years ago.  Completions in the first seven months of 2006 amounted to 10,869 units, an increase of 13.5% on the corresponding period in 2005.  The Government will continue to focus on maintaining overall housing supply at a level consistent with the continuing strong demand and maximising the availability of affordable housing through a range of instruments including investment in infrastructure, streamlining of planning and more effective use of land.</p>
            <p eId="para_14695">A number of measures to assist those who cannot access affordable housing without assistance have been put in place.  In 2005 the Government established the Affordable Homes Partnership to accelerate the delivery of affordable housing in the Greater Dublin area, where availability is most acute.  The Partnership, whose remit has recently been extended, is making very good progress in their work.  Eligibility and subsidy levels under the various schemes were increased in January 2006.   The partnership agreement Towards 2016 has set an ambitious target of delivering some 17,000 affordable homes over the period 2007 to 2009.  This represents a significant increase on the rate of output of affordable housing over the past three years and will make an important contribution to addressing affordability problems.  Investment of some €4 billion will be made under the various schemes over the next three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_14696">On the fiscal side first time buyers are entitled to mortgage interest tax relief on higher amounts of interest, up to €8,000 in the case of a couple, for the first 7 years of the loan.  Reduced stamp duty yielded significant savings for first time buyers and has been particularly beneficial for people saving for a deposit.</p>

            <p eId="para_14700">The compilation and publication of the register of electors is a matter for each local registration authority in accordance with electoral law.  While I have put in place a programme of measures to assist and support local authorities in their registration work, it is the duty of local authorities to ensure as far as possible the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register; in carrying out this work, local authorities depend to a significant degree on the cooperation and engagement of the general public.</p>
            <p eId="para_14701">Section 8 of the Electoral Act 1992 states that to be eligible for registration as a Dáil elector a person must be ordinarily resident in a constituency on the qualifying date (1 September in the year preceding the year in which the Register comes into force).  Section 11 of the Act places a prohibition on a person being registered as an elector more than once in any registration area or in more than one registration area.</p>
            <p eId="para_14702">Long standing guidance from the Department suggests that students be given the option of being registered at their parents' home or at the students' residential address.  While the guidance further suggests that persons who normally return to their parents' home at the weekends and for holidays should be registered where they live for work purposes, the determination of ordinary residence is a matter for decision by the local authority (or the County Registrar in the case of a claim) in the light of the circumstances of each particular case.</p>
            <p eId="para_14703">I understand that Mayo County Council, the registration authority concerned, has indicated that fieldworkers who are currently conducting house-to-house enquiries are advising people in such cases that they should register where they are residing for work purposes.  However, the Council also confirmed that each case will be considered on its merits and exceptions may be made where there is a compelling case to include an individual on the Register.  In addition, the Council stated that, on publication of the Draft Register of Electors on 1 November, individuals if they wish can make a claim to have their registration details altered and the matter will be determined by the County Registrar.</p>

The operative date of 1 January 2007 is subject to a transitional exemption period for new dwellings for which planning permission had been applied for before 1 July 2006, provided substantial work is completed by 30 June 2008.  The amended Part L of the Building Regulations 2005-(Conservation of Fuel and Energy) and the related Technical Guidance Document L which is operative from 1 July 2006, introduced a building energy performance methodology for new dwellings, as required by the Directive.  The methodology for demonstrating compliance with Part L is known as the Dwellings Energy Assessment Procedure (DEAP), which was published by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) in June 2006.  DEAP will also be the method used to produce Building Energy Ratings for new dwellings.</p>

While current arrangements for schools may, as with other non-domestic users, be based on fixed water services charges, Cork City Council, in common with other local authorities and in line with the above policies, are now moving towards the metering of all non-domestic water use.  This is to provide a transparent and equitable cost recovery mechanism for water services, which should incentivise all non-domestic users, including schools, to conserve their use of water and thus minimise this element of their running costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_14718">My Department will have regard to the recently published preliminary Census data, as well as the further reports to be prepared by the Central Statistics Offices over the coming months deriving from the 2006 Census, when reviewing relevant policy areas for which the Department is responsible.  For example, the Department will examine the potential implications of the preliminary data for the National Spatial Strategy, the Regional Planning Guidelines and City and County Development Plans and associated Housing Strategies.  This examination will assist in ensuring more effective infrastructural investment, and sustainable and balanced regional development over the coming years and will inform investment in social and affordable housing programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_14719">Government policy on the control and regulation of numbers in the public sector, including local authorities, was announced in the Minister for Finance's Budget statement of 7 December 2005.  I am continuing to keep the overall employment position in the sector under regular review, having regard to the need to deliver quality front line services and achieve value for money within the parameters of Government policy on public service employment generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_14720">Details of approved water services schemes for the Greater Dublin Area are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005 – 2007 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  In June 2006 all local authorities were asked to produce updated assessments of the need for new water services infrastructure in their areas in light of economic, demographic and other developments since the previous assessments were completed in 2003.  Local authorities would have had regard to the preliminary results of the 2006 Census in that context.  The infrastructural priorities identified by authorities in these latest assessments of needs will be taken into account in the selection of new schemes for funding under the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme and in the context of the National Development Programme for 2007-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_14721">Population is one of a range of factors which are used in determining general purpose grant allocations from the Local Government Fund.  The results of the 2006 Census Preliminary Report will be taken into account for that purpose.</p>

            <p eId="para_14726">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1514 to 1516, inclusive and 1551 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_14727">Accommodation provided under my Department's social and affordable housing programmes includes a range of delivery mechanisms including new build, Part V, turnkey developments and acquisitions.  The composition and ongoing management of the housing stock, including matters arising from the acquisition of apartments in private developments and consequential membership of the relevant management company consisting of all the apartment owners concerned, is a matter for individual housing authorities having regard to their particular circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_14728">In general, apartment complex management companies are constituted under the Companies Acts and are required to comply with the provisions of company law which is a matter for Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment.  I understand that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment hopes to bring proposals for amendment of company law to Government later this year, which are expected to include certain changes relevant to management companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_14729">As many of the legal issues relating to the establishment, operation and control of management companies are generally outside my Department's area of responsibility my Department is engaging with a number of relevant agencies regarding aspects of the issue, including the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Law Reform Commission, the National Consumer Agency.  My Department is also engaging with local authorities and the construction industry on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_14730">A Law Reform Commission Working Group is currently examining legal aspects generally regarding management of multi-unit structures and its consultation paper is expected shortly.  The Government will consider the recommendations in its final report including the need for any new measures to be taken in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_14731">The Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) will have the function of licensing, regulating and dealing with complaints relating to managing agents.  These are commercial firms engaged by management companies to carry out day-to-day management and maintenance.  The Authority will also have a public information function in relation to property management. The PSRA, and its functions, will be provided for in legislation that is being prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I understand that an Implementation Group and a Director Designate are already in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_14732">The National Consumer Agency is to publish a report on the issue very shortly and also intends to publish a consumer information document.  I and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have also responded on the above lines to concerns raised by Deputies in representations on behalf of the constituents, including in relation to the Tallaght Area.</p>

            <p eId="para_14734">My Department issued a circular letter (PD 5/06) to planning authorities on 5 July 2006 regarding planning conditions and management companies.  That circular advised planning authorities that they should only attach planning conditions in relation to the ongoing management of shared facilities in circumstances where they judge that those are clearly required for the benefit of residents of an estate.  It also advised that the existence of a management company to maintain elements of common buildings, carry out landscaping, etc. must not impact upon the decision by the authority to take in charge roads and related infrastructure where a request to do so is made.</p>
            <p eId="para_14735">The circular indicated my intention to establish a Working Group, representative of local authorities and a range of other interests, including consumer interests, to look further at this matter.  The Working Group will hold its first meeting on 28 September 2006.  My Department will bring the issue raised in the Question to the attention of the Working Group.</p>

            <p eId="para_14802">I announced on 3 May this year as, part of a series of measures to build on the successful farm plastic collection scheme, that five local authorities — Clare, Galway, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford County Councils — would provide designated facilities on a temporary once-off basis where farmers could deposit waste silage/bale wrap free of charge.  Funding was made available to these local authorities from the Environment Fund to meet the costs associated with the operation of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_14803">The initial trial has now concluded in all five counties and information was sought by my Department in relation to, <i>inter alia</i>, the volumes of farm plastics collected and the costs associated with the baling, transport and onward recycling of all such material.  All of the evidence available suggests that the pilot scheme has been extraordinarily successful and well supported by farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_14804">While final returns are awaited from the participating councils, on the basis of information received to date from the local authorities concerned, it is estimated that in excess of 9,300 tonnes of waste silage/bale wrap has been recovered at a cost of approximately €1.8 million.  One significant finding from the pilot scheme was that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators.  Accordingly, it will be necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.  In addition, it was noted that there was a high level of demand for collection in counties with a high proportion of farmers participating in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS).  Arising from a comprehensive examination of the information available, I will be announcing an extension of the scheme shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_14812">The tabular statement gives details of the combined capital allocation for disabled persons and essential repairs grants notified to each local authority and the combined expenditure on the schemes by each local authority in 2005.  In 2005 the capital allocation for these schemes was €74.5 million.  Actual expenditure, notified to the Department by local authorities was €64.6 m, of which €60.2 million was spent on disabled persons and essential repairs grants for private dwellings with a further €4.4 million spent on works of adaptation to make local authority dwellings more suitable for a disabled member of the household.</p>
            <p eId="para_14813">The combined capital allocation to local authorities for the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes represents not a capital grant, but the total amount which authorities are authorised to spend on the schemes in the year in which the allocation is made.  Expenditure on the grant schemes is funded by the two-thirds recoupment available from my Department together with the one-third contribution from the revenue resources of the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_14814">The final out-turn reflects the expenditure by local authorities on approved applications.  The initial allocations presented the local authorities' best estimate of the likely level of grant approvals during 2005.  However, some grant approvals by local authorities may not subsequently be taken up by applicants.  In addition, if there are delays in applicants completing the approved works, either due to a delay in getting contractors or for other reasons, the ultimate spend may arise in later years.</p>
            <p eId="para_14815">Local authorities were notified in June 2005 of their combined capital allocation and were requested on a number of occasions to notify the Department if it became evident that the allocation notified was likely to be inadequate or surplus to requirements.  Increased allocations were approved for a number of local authorities.  The Department stressed the need to ensure that, in the light of the high level of demand for these grants, the available allocation is expended in full and to ensure that the level of their approvals was such that would facilitate expenditure of the full allocation.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_15395">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1541 and 1555 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_15396">The WEEE scheme came into effect in August 2005 and has been a remarkable success.  In the first 12 months of operation, 27,700 tonnes of household WEEE was collected.  This represents approximately 2.3 million electrical and electronic products. This contrasts to the 5,510 tonnes of this waste type which was recovered in 2004 and indicates widespread public support for the scheme.  Under the terms of the WEEE Directive, financing the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment is now solely a producer responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_15397">The Directive places two distinct obligations on producers: producers must finance the recovery and recycling of any item of household electrical and electronic equipment they themselves have placed on the market since 13 August when it reaches end of life; and producers must finance the recovery and recycling of all household electrical waste that arises from goods sold before 13 August 2005 (known as "historic WEEE") in proportion to their current market share.  This includes paying for all historic waste as it arises whether it is taken back by a retailer on a one-for-one basis or deposited at a local authority recycling centre.  It also includes paying for waste from producers who are no longer in the market or who cannot be traced.  The Directive allows producers to show the cost of recovering and recycling "historic" household WEEE, in recognition of the substantial legacy of old waste which is now the financial responsibility of current producers.</p>
            <p eId="para_15398">The EMCs show the costs of recovery and recycling based on data submitted by producers to the WEEE Register Society Limited, the industry-based national WEEE registration body, which has an independent Committee of Management.  The approval of EMCs is a matter for WEEE Register and my Department has no function in the matter.  EMCs are not imposed by, or remitted to, the Government, but are paid by producers to the two collective compliance schemes operating in Ireland, WEEE Ireland and the European Recycling Platform who are operating the Producer Responsibility Initiative.  Both organisations operate on a not for profit basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_15399">Following a thorough review of the initial EMCs the WEEE Register announced reductions for most categories of electrical and electronic equipment in July last and these were implemented with effect from 1 August 2006.  A further review of the EMCs applying to fridges and fridge-freezers has now been completed by WEEE Register and reductions in these were announced this week.</p>

            <p eId="para_15403">In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority.  It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.  In April 2006, I announced a package of measures to assist local authorities in their work on preparing the 2007/8 Register, which included the use of Census enumerators or other temporary personnel to support local authorities in preparing the next Register.  The CSO contacted census enumerators seeking expressions of interest in the work; lists of enumerators expressing such an interest in each city and county council area were made available to local authorities.  This cleared the way for recruitment and deployment, as appropriate, by local authorities of additional temporary staff for the registration campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_15404">In addition, my Department worked with a group of local authority managers and senior officials to put in place an enhanced programme for improving the next Register.  Detailed procedures for the carrying out of registration fieldwork were finalised and issued to local authorities in early July.  New supplies of the electoral registration (RFA) forms were distributed to all local authorities in June (significantly earlier than in previous years).</p>
            <p eId="para_15405">I also committed to providing additional ring-fenced financial resources to support local authorities' own spending in respect of the register campaign and have advised authorities that a contribution of some €6 million can be made available in this regard.  An initial allocation of some €3 million was made available in July to local authorities for registration work.</p>
            <p eId="para_15406">As regards publicity and awareness, a two-stage approach has been developed, involving information notices followed by an intensive media campaign.  Information notices were published in the national press on 19-21 August, urging co-operation with local register campaigns.  In addition, a national publicity and awareness campaign involving TV, radio, press and outdoor advertising commenced on 11 September and will run until 25 November (the closing date for submitting corrections to the Draft Register).</p>
            <p eId="para_15407">An online register search facility is now available through local authority websites.  A link from the Department's website (<i>www.environ.ie</i>) to the relevant search facility has also been provided.  New arrangements for the deletion of names of deceased persons from the Register are now in place: the new system allows for the efficient and timely deletion of the names of deceased persons from the Register using the Death Event Publication Service which has been developed by Reach in association with the General Register Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_15408">New guidance for local authorities on Preparing and Maintaining the Register of Electors was made available to authorities in electronic format on 31 May.  Printed copies of the guidance were subsequently sent to all local authorities, returning officers and relevant Government Departments.  In the final version of the guidance, the importance of local authorities cross-checking the Register with other databases available to them is stressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_15409">The measures I announced in April are important supports for action by local authorities to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register in their areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_15413">Pursuant to Council Decision 2002/358/EC, Ireland is required to limit its emissions to 13% above 1990 levels during the period for assessing compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, 2008-2012.  The Government is committed to meeting this requirement.  The most recent projections of greenhouse gas emissions for the 2008-2012 period, which include the expected effects of all measures in place by March 2006, show that Ireland at present faces an average annual distance to its Kyoto Protocol target of approximately 7 million tonnes over the 2008-2012 period, a reduction of approximately 2 million tonnes per annum on previous projections.</p>
            <p eId="para_15414">There are three strands to the Government's approach to achieving the further reductions needed to bridge the remaining distance to target: emissions reductions, or purchase of carbon allowances, by installations participating in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme; use of the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms by the Government to purchase credits for carbon reductions elsewhere in the world; and measures to reduce emissions throughout the economy, in addition to those set out in the National Climate Change Strategy and those introduced subsequently.</p>
            <p eId="para_15415">A report on the implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy, Ireland's Pathway to Kyoto Compliance, was published in July 2006 and sets out options for further measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>

            <p eId="para_15417">Under the planning code, planning permission is normally required for telecommunications masts.

The committee, on which my Department is represented, is constituted provide advice to the Government on the appropriate action to be taken on foot of the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Committee report.  The work of the committee and expert group is in train and I understand that their report is expected to be made to the Government by the end 2006, following which the Government will address appropriate action.</p>

            <p eId="para_15441">I very much welcome the publication of the Third Report of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government on Recycling of Household Waste in Ireland.  The percentages for recycling given in Table 1 of the Report are based on returns submitted by 19 out of 34 city and county councils surveyed.  The average household diversion rate reported by Councils that made a return was 27.75%, a very significant increase on the 19.5% diversion of household waste from landfill reported by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the National Waste Report 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_15442">The Oireachtas report, along with Service Indicators in Local Authorities 2005 recently published by the Local Government Management Services Board, allows elected representatives and the public to scrutinise the performance of their local authority with a view to identifying where improvements in services can be delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_15443">My Department will continue to provide support to local authorities as part of an overall waste management policy that has seen dramatic improvements in waste management performance in recent years as evidenced by increases in national recycling rates to over 34%, and of the other key significant achievements in this area includes: doubling the number of bring banks over the period from 1998 to 2004, rising from 837 to 1,929; increasing the number of recycling centres substantially from 30 to 69 over the same period; diversion of household waste from landfill rose 8 fold from 37,000 tonnes in 1998 to almost 300,000 tonnes, in 2004; the roll-out of segregated collection of recyclables grew from 70,000 households in 1998 to over 560,000 by 2003 and is continuing to rise; of packaging waste (bottles, cans, cardboard etc) recycled in 2004, one year ahead of the 50% target required under EU Law, up from 15% in 1998; the EPA estimate that  85.2% of construction and demolition waste was recycled in 2004.</p>

            <p eId="para_15445">My Department in conjunction with the EPA, local authorities and other agencies is also pursuing a comprehensive range of measures to protect and improve water quality generally in the context of implementation of the Water Framework Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Nitrates Directive and related EU legislation.  Under the European Communities (Water Policy) Regulations 2003, which transposes the Water Framework Directive, into national law, local authorities are required to take a coordinated approach to water management in respect of whole river basins with a view to preventing any deterioration in the existing status of any waters and achieving at least "good status" in relation to all waters by 2015.  In this regard the river basin district projects, led by local authorities and funded by my Department, play a key role.</p>
            <p eId="para_15446">Local authorities are required to bring forward by 2008 proposals for River Basin Management Plans, including comprehensive programmes of measures, so as to achieve the environmental objectives laid down by the Water Framework Directive.  The Tramore river is included in the South Western River Basin District Project, which is being led by Cork County Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_15448">The new partnership agreement, Towards 2016, contains a commitment that minimum private rented housing standards regulations will be updated and effectively enforced.  Earlier this month I announced an Action Programme which comprehensively addresses the standards issue involving a combination of promotion, information, appropriate regulation and strategic enforcement, backed up by funding for local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_15449">In relation to enforcement, local authorities are being asked to prioritise action to improve enforcement of the regulations through a planned and strategic approach, focussing particularly on the accommodation most likely to be deficient, while avoiding, as far as possible, adverse impact on tenants.  Increased funding is also being provided to local authorities from the proceeds of tenancy registration fees for the enforcement of the regulations.  Interim payments totalling €1m have recently been made to local authorities in respect of 2006.  The distribution of the balance of the 2006 funds will take account of enforcement performance.  Local authorities will be required to provide returns on enforcement for inclusion in the Housing Statistics Bulletin.  All future payments will be related to these returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_15450">In addition, the Centre for Housing Research will undertake a study of measures to promote improvement in private rented accommodation standards and develop good practice guidelines to assist housing authorities in their functions relating to the private rented sector with a view to achieving increased effectiveness, including more strategic and proactive approaches to enforcement.  I am confident that the proposed measures will result in greater enforcement by local authorities.</p>
