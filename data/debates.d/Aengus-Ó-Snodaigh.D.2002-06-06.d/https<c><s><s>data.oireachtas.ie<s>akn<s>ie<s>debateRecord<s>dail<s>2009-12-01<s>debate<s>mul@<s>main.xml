            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_4">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">The legislative priorities of the Government for the current Dáil session are set out in the legislation programme published on 16 September 2009 and the Government will publish its legislation programme as usual at the beginning of each session throughout the remainder of the Thirtieth Dáil.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">Apart from the Statute Law Revision Bill, which was passed by the Dáil on Thursday 19 November, my Department has no legislation planned for the current Dáil session.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_7">The Murphy report into child abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin reveals a litany of abuse of staggering proportions.  Those in a position of authority within the Church who knowingly allowed this to continue deserve condemnation.  In his capacity as spokesperson on children for the Fine Gael party, Deputy Alan Shatter pointed out that both the State and State agencies are still failing to protect children, protection to which they are properly entitled.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">We now accept, as does the Government, the advice of the Attorney General and the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children that there is no need for a referendum on legislating for soft information.  The failure of the Government to implement one of the key recommendations of the Ferns report means that at this moment children are vulnerable and subject to predators in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">Will the Taoiseach see to it that the child protection guidelines, Children First, will be put on a statutory footing?  Will he see to it, as Taoiseach, that this legislative proposal gets absolute priority for implementation early in 2010?  Will he give a commitment to hold a referendum on children's rights so that recognition of children can be expressed in the Constitution, as committed to on more than one occasion by this Government and its predecessor?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_10">As the Deputy said, the report outlines a harrowing litany of abuses suffered by children at the hands of clergy operating under the aegis of the Dublin archdiocese.  The report also made a number of comments on how the State acted with regard to allegations of abuse made against clergy members.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, and his officials will consider the Dublin report with a view to establishing what must be done in addition to what was planned for implementation in the plan developed by the Minister of State in response to the Ryan commission report, published in May.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">Concerns have been expressed about the statutory powers of the HSE to deal with child sexual abuse by non-family members.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will be consulting further with the Office of the Attorney General to seek clarity in that regard.  It should be noted that the HSE has powers under section 3 of the Child Care Act 1991 to promote the welfare of children not receiving adequate care and protection.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in co-operation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has commenced the process of preparing heads of a Bill in respect of the use of soft information.  Other Departments, An Garda Síochána and the HSE are being consulted on the draft heads.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">Soft information is information available to authorities in respect of which the person to whom it relates has not been charged or convicted of a criminal offence.  The proposed legislation on soft information will need to have regard to the constitutional rights of persons, including the rights to equality before the law, to a good name, to privacy and to earn a livelihood.  It will also have to address the right to fair procedures and have regard to the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">A revised edition of the Children First guidelines is to be published shortly and the guidelines will be promulgated throughout the public service.  In addition, the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is committed to the preparation of legislation to ensure that State employees and staff from key agencies in receipt of Exchequer funding and who are working with children will have a duty to comply with the Children First guidelines.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusKirk" as="#Ceann_Comhairle" eId="spk_4">
            <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
            <p eId="para_14">We need to consider the appropriateness of asking questions on legislation that pertains to Departments other than the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_15">As the Taoiseach rightly pointed out some days ago, he chairs an all-party committee dealing with areas other than those that pertain to his own Department.  I have no doubt he is well able to answer these questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">For quite some time, we have been told about draft heads of Bills being circulated.   This matter is obviously very serious and sensitive, but the State is now in a position to drive through the legislation on soft information expeditiously.  It is very important.  It has taken the Government a number of years to come around to the opinion that one does not need a referendum to legislate for soft information.  While I recognise there must be consultation, all I want from the Taoiseach today is a commitment that the Government will prioritise the legislation, which is critical for children who are vulnerable or are likely to be victims of predators of the kind in question.  When the consultation is taking place, can I take it that the spring legislative agenda will accord priority to legislating for soft information in the House?  This side of the House will support the Government in passing and implementing the legislation as quickly as possible.  I did not catch the Taoiseach's reply on whether a referendum on children's rights will be a commitment of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">The former chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency appeared before an Oireachtas committee and criticised Government policy in respect of NAMA.  The Inland Fisheries Bill now states: "In carrying out duties under this section, the chief executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such policy."  Is it a new departure that a provision such as this is to be inserted in all legislation such that people will not be able to speak their minds or tell the truth before Oireachtas committees?  Is this change being made because of what occurred at the committee meeting at which the former chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency gave his view on NAMA?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_6">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_18">On the second point, I am not aware there is any connection between those two issues.  The Deputy had better ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about the Inland Fisheries Bill.  The person to whom Deputy Kenny referred, who appeared before a committee, indicated subsequently that he was not opposed to the policy but that he was just giving some views on how it was developing.  Having been involved in many of the discussions that took place on how we would deal with the situation, he recognised the agency would be important in that respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">To come back to the point regarding the first series of questions Deputy Kenny asked, as I said the heads of the Bill are being prepared and it will be dealt with as a priority issue.  It is a complex area.  It was not a question of the Bill simply being delayed.  It was discussed in an all-party committee context to see whether the issue would be dealt with through a constitutional referendum or through legislation.  It is an important issue, which has again been highlighted as important to proceed with.  The Government will proceed with the Bill and I do not think anyone would question the commitment of the Minister of State at the Department ofHealth and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, to move these issues forward as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_20">The question of a referendum on children's rights is a matter the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, is considering and has been examined by previous Administrations.  It is a matter to which we can give consideration but the immediate priority has to be the legislative proposals to which the Deputy referred.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_21">I understand there are only nine sitting days left for this session of the Dáil.  The Standards in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 went before the Seanad on 4 July 2007.  It is still on the Order Paper after two years.  The Taoiseach is aware that when he was Minister for Finance the main provisions of the Bill were to raise the value of a gift Ministers and Ministers of State can receive from €650 to €2,000.  Things have changed since then.  What is the current status of the Bill?  Is it intended to put it before the House, leave it on the Order Paper or change the levels which were determined at the time?  The value of a gift which would not impinge upon the work or intention of a Minister or Minister of State in Government was determined to be €2,000.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_8">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_22">I take the Deputy's point. As the Bill is still on the Order Paper, it is a matter for the Whips and the organisation of the House to decide how and when it can be taken.  The Department has been dealing with other important legislation which is of a higher priority.  It remains on the Order Paper and I understand Second Stage has not yet been taken.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_23">I am sure when the Taoiseach or Ministers carry out official duties around the country communities give them mementos of their visit.  Does the Taoiseach think that a gift to the value of €2,000 is somewhat excessive?  The members of the Cabinet have acquired many pieces of glass and bog deal from the official openings they conduct.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_10">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_24">I cannot recall the exact provisions of the Bill as it is a long time since it was discussed in the Seanad, but I understand it relates to an issue which arose at the time, that is, people who receive support from people other than family members or those working in an official capacity.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_11">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_25">Last year, only 25 Bills were enacted, the lowest number for more than a decade.  This year, 20 Bills were listed by the Government for legislation when the Dáil resumed on 16 September, only four of which have been published.  I understand there is a Cabinet committee on legislation, for which the Taoiseach's Department is responsible.  In the context of the protection of children and the aftermath of the publication of the Murphy report, I would like to raise three issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">Following on from the Taoiseach's previous reply, has he a date in mind for the introduction of a Bill concerning soft information?  In the Murphy report, problems regarding soft information were central to the strategy of various clerical paedophiles in terms of being protected and not properly investigated.  A number of bishops were criticised in the report.</p>

          <speech by="#SeamusKirk" as="#Ceann_Comhairle" eId="spk_12">
            <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
            <p eId="para_27">The Deputy's questions would be more appropriate to another Minister.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_13">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_28">The issue was that soft information was obviously not shared among parishes or dioceses or at an all-Ireland church level so that the children could be protected.  When will the legislation to protect children and dealing with soft information be brought before the House?</p>
            <p eId="para_29">Many of the serving bishops mentioned in the report are patrons of primary schools that are funded by the State, but under the patronage of the Catholic Church and other bodies.  Does the Government plan to introduce any legislative changes to address this issue?  Does the Taoiseach consider it appropriate for patrons, who have been identified in the report as having behaved wrongly when it came to trying to apprehend and stop paedophiles, to continue to be patrons?</p>

Only four Bills of 20 promised have been published this session.  What is the problem with promised legislation?

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_40">Regarding the legislative programme, since the Government came to office after the last general election on 14 June 2007, some 73 Bills have been enacted.  There was not a pre-existing raft of legislation that was coming from the previous Dáil as all of that legislation was cleared.  It enabled us to enter the Thirtieth Dáil without that backlog of work to be conducted as well.  In the summer session 29 Bills were published.  As Deputies, and particularly Deputy Burton will be aware, in the current autumn session some landmark legislation has been introduced and this has rightly taken up much of the legislative time of the House because of its importance.  I refer to the National Asset Management Agency Bill and other financial-type Bills that needed to be dealt with.  In the current autumn session seven Bills have been published to date and I understand the remaining Bills on the A list will also be published before the end of the session, which is the normal criteria for putting Bills on the A list at the beginning of any parliamentary session.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">Deputy Burton then referred to other questions she wishes to ask arising out of the Murphy report.  The question of the ownership of schools and those involved in the management of schools has been evolving for some time now.  For many years the vocational education system has been dealing with the vocational stream of second level education, post-leaving certificate courses, further education centres and so on.  In addition, we have Educate Together and the gaelscoil movement.  Thus, there are various models; there is not a uniform school management structure.  This has evolved over time and will continue to do so.  During a discussion in the House some time ago, various public statements were made — including one by the then Archbishop of Dublin — about the possibility of bringing together a forum to deal with these matters and look to the future.  The situation is developing.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">To answer the Deputy's question directly, there has not been a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee on legislation, at which these matters could have been considered, since the publication of this report last Thursday evening.  Both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs have given detailed statements on behalf of the Government concerning the work that has been done and remains to be done arising from this report, as well as the Ryan report, from which many recommendations have emerged.  The general policy question raised by the Deputy is one that will evolve over time.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">Does the Taoiseach have a date for the legislation dealing with soft information?  Does he consider it to be urgent?  Does he think the bishops who have been severely criticised in the Murphy report are suitable persons to remain as patrons of primary schools which are educating young children?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_27">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_46">It is important to point out that the role of patron does not involve any executive function in the management of schools.  In many cases the positions have arisen from the historical involvement of religious denominations — not a particular church — in education.  I have explained to the Deputy that this structure has evolved and changed over time to reflect the social changes that have taken place.  Further policy development in this area will be required in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">With regard to the legislation that was mentioned, the heads of the Bill are being prepared as a matter of priority by the Minister and, I understand from his comments in recent days, will be brought to Government within the next month or so.  We will then proceed through the legislative process to a more detailed drafting of the Bill.  The matter will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible given the criteria that must be taken into account, which are complex, although this should not provide a reason for undue delay.</p>

            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_48">In view of the recent flooding emergency and the specific role of the Department of the Taoiseach with regard to the Office of Public Works, is legislation being planned to give more power and funding to the OPW to build flood protections, particularly in areas such as Gort, Cork and Clonmel?  These areas have had other major flooding events but the problem was never addressed.  In view of the failure of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to carry out its remit, legislation should be introduced to give the OPW the power to deal with this issue, which has been in the news of late because of the disaster that has struck those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">I am also seeking information on other legislation because when Deputies ask questions on the Order of Business, we do not always receive a full answer.  Given the Taoiseach's role in the Cabinet sub-committee on legislation, he may be able to provide us with some information.  Is legislation planned to establish an independent electoral commission to take over the running of elections and the drawing of constituency boundaries and to develop a new electoral system for the Seanad?</p>
            <p eId="para_50">The following is another area in which legislation is desired, but perhaps the Taoiseach has moved forward in this regard.  Some of his Cabinet colleagues seem to be in favour of a more open and transparent system of appointments to public bodies.  Is that legislation forthcoming?</p>
            <p eId="para_51">The final matter I want to ask the Taoiseach about today is the proposal which his Government colleagues in the Green Party have suggested in the past.  Is there legislation for a new system of financing local government?  Hopefully, the Taoiseach will be able to address some of those matters.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_29">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_52">On the flood relief schemes, etc., as I stated last week there is approximately €34 million being spent in programmes this year.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh mentioned Clonmel.  Phase one of the Clonmel scheme has been completed.  Phases two and three are gone to tender, with construction probably due to start in March.  On my visit there one could see the significant benefit of that project.  It certainly saved that part of the town from flooding on this occasion.  Similar defences in Kilkenny and Carrick-on-Suir have provided that sort of protection for many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_53">Clearly, what has emerged is that part of the assessment now must be what work needs to be done in the longer term as a result of the very considerable flooding in recent weeks.  There are plans in the Office of Public Works for continuing to provide flood relief works and schemes.  They have certain plans up to 2014 subject to budgetary requirements.  These are issues that will receive priority and have been receiving priority even at a time of tight financial constraints being imposed on the Government, and this will continue.  There is also a great deal of technical work ongoing at present, all of which must be considered.  There is in the Office of Public Works a recognition that this is important infrastructural work that must take place.  Existing priorities and the revision of priorities arising out of what has emerged in recent weeks will form the basis for further work by the OPW in the years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_54">On some of the issues Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised, in the revised programme for Government there is a commitment to establish an independent electoral commission incorporating the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission with enhanced powers of inspection.  That commitment will pass to the line Minister for progressing over the course of the remainder of the term of this Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">The Deputy spoke about the question of open and transparent appointment of persons to State bodies.  That does not necessarily need a legislative base.  Practices have been initiated in some instances where, for example, the committees have had a say in the establishment of the NAMA commission, and the Minister for Finance invited proposals from Opposition Deputies for consideration.  At the end of the day, it is the prerogative of Government to make these appointments but, obviously, one always seeks to appoint persons who fulfil the criteria necessary, who have a competence and an interest in the area, or who have shown by their activities in other occupations or professions to be capable and competent to serve on a board.  This is an issue that is there for consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">My Department has supported the international financial services industry in Ireland since the establishment of the IFSC in 1987.  It does so through the mechanism of the clearing house group, the working groups in the areas of banking and treasury, funds, insurance, pensions and a task force on asset management.  These dedicated working groups and the task force report to the clearing house group on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">The clearing house group is chaired by the secretary general of my Department and its membership includes senior public and industry representatives.  Industry members of the groups include representatives of industry associations and of prominent figures from the international financial services industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">There are also representatives from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Financial Regulator, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and the Stock Exchange.  The clearing house group identifies and considers issues of major concern to the long-term development of the international financial services industry in Ireland.  These issues include the strategic development of new business areas and opportunities, the progress of relevant legislation and responsibility for overseeing and reporting to the Government on any initiatives undertaken in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">Last February, my Department consulted industry at a facilitated workshop with the intention of considering the major issues of concern to them in the current environment and to identify lines of action and initiatives to chart the way forward for the industry.  The recommendations and proposals put forward at this workshop are being worked through by various Departments and agencies.  The work is guided by the 2006 strategy document "Building on Success".</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_65">Three years ago next week, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, launched "Building on Success", which was a new strategy for the future development of the financial services industry.  That was followed by a progress report in July 2008.  The development of the financial services industry is a critical part of Ireland's economic success, our reputation and our standing.  As the Taoiseach pointed out, the Government's clearing house group, within his own Department, monitors commitments made in the strategy.  As the situation has changed so dramatically in the past two years, can we expect another progress report on the financial services industry similar to the one in 2008?</p>
            <p eId="para_66">At the launch of the "Building on Success" document in 2007, the then Taoiseach referred to the establishment of what is known as the centre for financial services skills before mid-2007.  What is the current status of that centre?</p>

            <p eId="para_70">I thank Deputy Quinn.  The current Taoiseach established the financial legislation advisory forum in May 2007 when he was Minister for Finance.  Its remit was to consolidate and modernise legislation governing financial regulation.  The forum's primary objective is to provide expert advice and support.  The Bill was to have been published within two years of the establishment of the forum.  What is the status of that Bill?  Where is it?  Why has the Government Whip not yet got his hands on it?  When can we expect to see it on the list of legislation to be brought before this House?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_71">The financial regulation legislation is being incorporated in the context of the Central Bank reforms that will take place.  The need to review fundamentally our whole financial regulatory structure arose in the aftermath of the financial crisis, which began to emerge in autumn 2008 and came to a very serious turn this autumn.  It is important to recognise — and I am sure the Deputy does — that the legislation concerning reform of the Central Bank is now a priority that is being attended to in the Department of Finance in the aftermath of the successful enactment of the NAMA legislation.  This is another enormous body of work that has to be undertaken in the interim, at a time when other projects were being mentioned.  I do not have the information regarding the group referred by the Deputy in the first part of his supplementary question but I can get it for him.</p>

            <p eId="para_72">The clearing house group has another function in respect of the document published by the Government a year ago, Building Ireland's Smart Economy, which has implications for the long-term development of the international financial services industry.  I understand that the clearing house group has met five times this year.  Will the Taoiseach say what advances or decisions have been made in respect of Building Ireland's Smart Economy, the report on a framework for sustainable economic renewal, by the clearing house group, with particular reference to the long-term development of the International Financial Services Centre, as envisaged in the report?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_73">The clearing house group is a technical group of people from various Departments as well as the Revenue Commissioners and the Stock Exchange, which identifies whether there are operational issues arising that need to be addressed.  It has met for that purpose on a number of occasions this year.  It also provides an informal opportunity to determine whether other opportunities might be identified for the financial services sector in Ireland, including those arising in the green financial services sector, for example.  The intention also is to see in what way we can assist in maintaining the levels of business, particularly regarding management of assets that have been grown over many years within the IFSC.  This is a very competitive area and it is a question of keeping in touch with the industry in terms of identifying what trends and practices are taking place, to see whether we can stay with the competition while at the same time protecting reputational issues for the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">On the question of the restoration of Ireland's reputation in terms of financial services and financial probity, what is the Taoiseach or the various committees doing to seek to restore the country's reputation in the context of the banking crash, and all the other events that have happened?  Has the Taoiseach or his Government had any contact with the new EU Commissioner Barnier, who will be dealing with the whole issue of financial markets regulation?  Does he foresee any further regulation of the IFSC, because international companies that locate there effectively want a gold-plated assurance scheme to the effect that regulation is of the highest level, particularly American companies reporting to their home jurisdictions?</p>

            <p eId="para_76">Did the Taoiseach see the recent remarks of Mr. David Went, chairman of the consultative industry panel, where he warned against excessive or intrusive regulation?

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_78">This is all about financial services regulation, as the Taoiseach knows.  We discussed this on many occasions when he was Minister for Finance.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_45">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_79">While I know Mr. Barnier, we have not as yet have had discussions with him.  He has not as yet been appointed Commissioner.  He has been nominated for the position and will not be <i>in situ</i> , probably, until February next year, when all the various hearings have been completed.  I am sure he will be successful since he is a former Commissioner, as well as a former Minister for Agriculture in the French Government.  Mr. Joaquin Almunia, who will continue in that role, has been a very competent person and Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, who was responsible for the Internal Market side of the equation, has done his job very well and capably.  The issue of regulation in the aftermath of what has happened is not simply European in scope, but requires global synchronisation in order to have a broad regulatory framework under which everyone can operate.  Obviously, financial services operate as a global market.  It is anticipated that at the next European Council meeting on 10 and 11 December, there will be a discussion on financial services both generally and in respect of certain regulatory aspects of the financial service industry.  While this will be dealt with in the first instance by ECOFIN, it also will be discussed by the Heads of State and Government at that Council meeting.  I expect this to be the next occasion on which there will be a detailed discussion on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">Certainly, the entire thrust has been to bring forward a regulatory regime which will be both more robust and ensure that financial services in Europe are competitive.  In the past, it is clear the level of financial innovation was such that the regulatory regime did not keep pace with it and some of the unfortunate consequences that arise from that have become evident.  While I do not know the context in which Mr. Went made his comments, it is important to find the balance between the need for adequate regulation that enables regulatory authorities to have the requisite information in sufficient time for them to do their job and the need to ensure the existence of a regulatory regime that is commensurate with the burdens that are being placed on other financial services industries in other countries and which is consistent with the need for a more prudential approach than was the case in the past, when the dangers of what has emerged subsequently had not been realised.</p>

            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_81">Can the Taoiseach tell Members what has been the level of job losses in the international financial services sector of late?  Does he know what proportion of the approximately 420,000 people who are unemployed were laid off from this sector and whether there is a pattern of such services moving from Ireland and from the international financial services sector in particular?  Is a strategy in place to retain and to create additional sustainable jobs in this sector?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_47">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_82">While some jobs have been lost in this sector because of the overall environment, the IFSC has withstood the worst aspects of the financial crisis creditably well.  Significant numbers of people are still employed there in well-remunerated jobs.  At individual company level, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are supporting an increasing number of multinational and indigenous financial service companies to invest in dedicated research and development activities to develop the next generation of products and services that will meet the changing market requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">Norkom Technologies and Citi constitute two good examples of companies leading the way in this regard.  I recently opened Citi's research, development, innovation and learning centre in the IFSC and the value and scale of the activity which is being carried out there is an example of the way forward for the industry.  Increasing product, services and business model innovation is particularly important and is a real potential source of competitive advantage.  Enterprise Ireland and the IDA would like to see more companies engage in such activities and can offer specific support for companies interested in investing in research and development.  This is a challenging area and as was noted previously, a clearing house group meets and works closely with industry towards achieving the objectives in our smart economy framework, for example.  This is an area for potential growth in the future despite the retrenchment that has been evident in recent times.</p>

        <b>Deputy Brian Hayes</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         his views on the fact that funds generated from third level college registration fees are used to supplement core funding for higher level institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_48">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_85">The student services charge is levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and student services.  The range of services may include such facilities as on-campus medical and counselling facilities for students, access and disability services, careers office services, student facilities, student clubs and societies.  It should be noted all students who are eligible for means-tested grants have the charge paid on their behalf by the local authorities or vocational education committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">As already announced, the Government indicated it was prepared to accept increases in the level of this charge for the academic year 2009-2010 to bring it to a limit of €1,500 in individual higher education institutions.  In the previous academic year, the charge stood at €900.  The increase in the charge for the 2009-2010 academic year enabled individual institutions to bring the amount contributed by students more into line with the real cost of providing student services in those institutions.  This was agreed on the understanding that the revenue generated by the increase adopted by each institution would reflect their requirements in defraying the full cost of items that fall to be funded by the charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">Where income from the charge did not previously meet the full cost of these services, this required an effective cross-subsidisation by institutions from their general block grant funding.  The overall block grant allocations made to institutions for 2010 took account of the anticipated additional revenue available to institutions from an increase in the charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">Systems of local accountability to students are in place across higher education institutions for the use of resources generated by the charge.  The Higher Education Authority has issued a framework of good practice for the provision of student services to the publicly funded higher education institutions. It consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source with particular emphasis on principles of transparency and accountability.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">The authority has written to all institutions on several occasions to ensure correct procedures are in place and to remind them of their function with the student services charge, in accordance with the framework of good practice.

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_64" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_107">In recent talks between my Department and the bishops of the Catholic Church, there was a wide-ranging and constructive discussion about the different issues that may arise in planning for the future development of provision for primary education.  The Catholic school patrons and my Department agreed it was essential to engage in planning for change.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">However, given the complexity of the issues involved and the necessity to take the wishes of local communities into consideration, the bishops did not feel they were in a position to provide a list of schools at this time.  To advance the matter, my Department agreed it would instead explore the range of issues involved by identifying specific geographical areas where a change of patronage might be relevant.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">The geographic areas chosen would be in areas of low-to-moderate demographic growth where the existing number of schools would not need to be increased in the foreseeable future but where a change of patronage might be relevant to cater for diversity.  In areas of rapid population growth requiring new schools, the choice of patron for a new school would continue, as at present, to have regard to the need for diversity.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">In this context, departmental officials are carrying out an assessment to identify a number of locations where changes to patronage may be warranted, given changed demographic profiles in recent decades.  Clearly, any implementation framework developed to facilitate the possible transfer of patronage would need to be planned and managed.  It would be important in individual school cases for consultation to take place with all relevant stakeholders, parents, teachers and local communities.  Any changes could only come about by agreement between the various stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">While I would not rule out the possibility of holding a further forum on school patronage in the future, considerable further thought must be given to the timing and format of such an event.  The results of the assessment being undertaken by my Department will also provide useful information in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">My interest in this matter, and that of the Labour Party, is not to disrupt the day job of schools or the delivery of quality education in the classroom.  It is, however, to reflect the frustration felt by parents in many built-up areas that they can no longer get their children into schools of their choice of ethos.  This is because of overcrowding and the schools, for the first time, having to ration places on the basis of baptismal certificates and household bills.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">I welcome the Minister's reply but will he agree that with rapid growth in the population we do not have the time for the normal speedy response of the Department of Education and Science?  Will he agree that a convention with all stakeholders would fast-track this necessary exercise?  I welcome the Minister's commitment in principle, and the commitment evinced by the Catholic bishops, that in a built-up area like my own constituency, for example, they are open to provide for diversity where growth is solid but not excessive and at the same time meet the needs of children and their parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">I find them outstanding, but that is another matter.  In our discussions with the Catholic bishops, Archbishop Martin has indicated clearly that where there is not a demand for a Catholic ethos or patronage in a school, the church is willing to consider that option.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">My officials met with the archbishop and Bishop O'Reilly last week or the previous week.  At that meeting we thought they might outline exactly what schools they had in mind in terms of a change of patronage.  They did not do that, but they indicated clearly that where we could identify areas where a change of patron might be deemed appropriate, they would consider them, but that it would only be done on the basis of discussion between the parents, teachers and general community.  We undertook to look through the geographical system that we have in place to consider not developing areas because they will be catered for anyway, but other areas of slow growth to examine whether there is a need for change.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">I welcome what the Minister has said.  We will have more time elsewhere to explore the matter.  In the light of the recent reports, specifically the Ryan report from earlier this year on religious congregations involved in primary and secondary education and its devastating conclusions, and now the mind numbing revelations from the Dublin archdiocese, as contained in the Murphy report, does the Minister personally feel it is appropriate for a Catholic archbishop with a track record of a diocese such as Dublin, or Cloyne which is closer to the Minister's constituency, to remain as patron of a primary school given his stewardship and management of deviant priests?</p>

            <p eId="para_121">It is important that we recognise the difference that exists between church and State, but as a Government we also recognise that the law will take its course for any bishop or archbishop who colluded in any way or who was responsible in any way for ensuring that the truth did not manifest itself.  The Garda will investigate and those people will be brought before the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">In terms of patronage, it is important that we understand exactly what happens.  In many instances bishops are patrons of schools.  They appoint two nominees and there are two parents' nominees.  The principal teacher of the school is on the board of management and there are two further nominees.  It would not be tolerated that the outstanding people across the country who are acting as members of boards of management would in any way be involved with the archbishops or anyone who broke the law.  The current management of schools is working exceptionally well.  The patron is in place in terms of ethos but has nothing to do with the overall management of schools.  That is the responsibility of the board of management.</p>

Those bishops who have been named in the Murphy report, who are now bishops in their own right in one of the 26 dioceses around the country, are patrons of schools and they have been deemed to have acted inappropriately.</p>

            <p eId="para_126">The Government and the Department are examining patronage in general.  We are involved in a wide-ranging review.  A steering group has been set up.  In addition, a group has been set up to consider new, developing areas, new patronage for schools and international experience in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_127">There have been dramatic changes in school patronage.  The Department is purchasing many sites now and the boards of management of those new schools that are set up are independent and separate from the Catholic Church.  Where school patrons have broken the law, we depend on the Garda to investigate to ensure that such persons are brought through the courts and that the appropriate punishment is administered.</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_129">I have had meetings with a number of groups on this issue.  The most recent such meeting was on 21 October when I met with the Committee on Management for Protestant Schools.  I extended an invitation to that committee to join a working group with my officials to identify particular measures to support the schools and to consider options that might deal with their needs.  Regrettably, the committee declined that invitation.  On 18 November, senior officials from my Department met with some of the bishops to consider how the issues could be progressed.  An arrangement is now in place to provide particular information that can assist my officials in their work on identifying measures aimed at sustaining schools in the Protestant sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">What has been sought at the meetings with me is a simple reversal of the budget measures, determined solely on a denominational criterion.  As I have explained previously in this House, that is not legally possible.  The Constitution, in Article 44°, permits State aid to denominational schools, but only on the basis of no discrimination between schools under different religious management.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">I am concerned at some of the claims that have been made on why legal advice was sought on the matter.  I welcome this opportunity to clarify the position in respect of the legal advices.  Work was under way in a more general context to identify legal advice on a range of issues.  However, this specific issue arose when, following an oral parliamentary question from Deputy Quinn on 18 October 2007 on the block grant and Article 44° of the Constitution, the Secretary General of my Department asked for an assessment of all legal advices and legal opinion on the difference in funding arrangements for Catholic and Protestant fee-charging schools.  That work identified a number of advices from 1983 onwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">The legal advice was brought to my attention during the preparation of savings options for consideration by the Government prior to budget 2008.  The issue was raised between the Attorney General and me in the context of the budget in October 2008.  It is clear that the provenance of the legal advices did not relate to the outcome of a High Court hearing, as has been claimed.  The High Court hearing concerned did not take place until June 2008.  My Department acted correctly in both ensuring that the lawfulness of the funding arrangements for fee-charging schools was considered and in identifying its relevance in terms of decisions taken collectively by the Government in budget 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_133">The words of Mandy Rice-Davies come to mind.  She famously said "Well, he would, wouldn't he?"  The same applies to the Minister and his Department.  We have been through this previously.  Angry words have been expressed on all sides of this House.  I am only concerned with one thing, namely, sorting out this issue and resolving it.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">I wish to make a proposal to the Minister for his consideration.  Whatever about his position on the auxiliary grants that, in effect, he took from the 21 Protestant fee-paying schools in last year's budget, would he consider an increase in the block grant, which as the Minister is aware, is administered by the SEC, which, in effect, is ring-fenced to poorer Protestant children who attend those schools?  As I noted recently in a reply the Minister made to a question of mine, that would not present any constitutional difficulty.  In lieu of the reductions the Minister has made to a range of grants to those schools in last year's budget, would he consider an increase to the block grant in the context of the Estimates?</p>

            <p eId="para_135">I wish to reach an accommodation as well.  I have met seven different groups from the Protestant denomination.  On all occasions I have made it clear that if there are difficulties, I wish to resolve them and to do that in consultation with them.  I was very disappointed when we met them two weeks ago.  I suggested establishing a working group but they refused point blank to do it.  All they wanted was a reversal of something I could not reverse.  It would be unconstitutional.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">I welcome the fact, however, that Archbishop Neill and Bishop Coulton met the Department's Secretary General and other officials last week.  Great progress was made at that meeting.  It has now been agreed that they will provide information to the Department outlining where there are difficulties for Protestant schools.  When that is done, we will examine and evaluate the information and make a decision on it.  At all times since this commenced, I have asked the Protestant community and its schools and bishops to provide information to me that shows clearly where there is real difficulty.  I accept there are some difficulties for rural Protestant schools.  If that can be outlined clearly, I am prepared to take action.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_137">The Minister is not ruling out the possibility of an increase in the block grant.  This is the means through which the State currently allows children from poorer Protestant backgrounds to go to these schools on a geographical basis.  As the Minister is aware, many counties in the Twenty-Six Counties do not have post-primary ethos-led education for those children.  Perhaps the Minister will give a fuller explanation to the House of the potential for the proposal I am making, that we consider an increase in the block grant administered by the SEC as a means of making up the difference for the amount taken from these schools as a result of the Minister's budgetary measures last year.

            <p eId="para_140">I am far more interested in having a targeted intervention for Protestant schools in rural areas that have been badly affected and need more support than they receive at present.  I would like that information to be provided before giving any consideration to increasing the block grant.  An increase in the block grant would create a bigger difference between the normal non-fee paying schools which most children in the country attend and Protestant fee-paying schools.  I do not believe Protestants themselves wish to see that happen.  I would prefer to target where there is an actual need, particularly in the case of rural Protestant schools, rather than blandly tell the House today that I will look at that.</p>

I ask the Minister to resolve this issue sooner rather than later.</p>

            <p eId="para_144">I am arranging to circulate the list referred to by the Deputy for the information of the House.  The forward planning section of my Department carried out an initial demographic analysis utilising the current enrolments in schools, and applied growth scenarios to those figures for each region based on information such as the CSO regional population projections 2011-26 to establish probable enrolments into the future.  This information formed the basis of a priority list of areas requiring further investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">To complete this further analysis, the forward planning section of my Department utilises the latest in geographical information system, GIS, technology to assist in planning school requirements in the future.  The GIS contains information on all schools in the country, at primary and post-primary level, geo-coded to their location.  The information is then linked to the relevant demographic information for those areas — typically the demographic information will be from the Central Statistic's Office census data, the general register of births, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, An Post's geo-directory and information supplied by local authorities through development plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">The requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas.  A thorough analysis of all of these areas is in progress by the forward planning section of my Department.  Information in regard to these areas has already been circulated to all existing school patrons, who have been invited to bring forward proposals for the expansion of existing schools or to put themselves forward as patron for any new primary school, should it be required.  Any proposed building projects arising from the detailed studies carried out on those priority areas will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme for 2010 and subsequent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_219">My constituency is not in the list in case the Deputy is wondering if there are developing areas in that part of Cork.  I have always tried to maintain a balance in funding for schools throughout the country, and I will continue to maintain that balance.  Last year, I put funding in place for a summer works scheme that enhanced 2,700 schools.  They were not left out at all.  The statistics for previous years show a fair spread of funding between developing areas and the rest of the country.  I will continue to maintain that balance.  There will be a further summer works scheme next year, with water conservation as part of the scheme.  I have provided €30 million this year for minor works in schools throughout the country.  Overall, 3,000 schools will have benefitted from that grant aid over the past 12 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_220">All of that has been taken on board.  What I am really concerned about is the schools in non-priority areas that have waited from five to 20 years for development.  The Minister met a delegation last week from my constituency.  The Department has paid €74,000 this year for prefabs for the delegation's school, and has paid that for the past 15 years.  The Minister must understand the position of these schools.  They see that estimates or tenders are 30% less than previously, while they discovered a month ago that half the Department's allocation for school buildings has not been spent.  The Minister says it will be spent by the end of the year; we will wait and see if that is so.  Now these schools are being excluded from the priority areas.  The Minister must give these non-priority areas some hope today.</p>

            <p eId="para_224">I will maintain a balance between developing, rural and urban areas.  The Government is committed to ensuring sufficient funding for a schools programme.  Last year saw the greatest amount of money ever spent and the greatest outturn.  For once and for all, I want to put something to bed, namely, money that is left over is committed to projects to be completed in 2010.  If one announces a project in 2009, it might take 12-18 months to be completed and paid for.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_228">The project at the school to which the Deputy refers has a complicated history from its inception as a small extension and refurbishment of the existing school through several revisions of the brief to its current brief, which is to provide a new eight-classroom school on a greenfield site.  The fact that my Department has purchased a new greenfield site for the school demonstrates our commitment to the project.  I accept that the project has been in architectural planning for a considerable period.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that, with more than 200 other major projects progressing through architectural planning, it is not possible to move all projects to construction at the same time or even in the same year.</p>
            <p eId="para_229">All applications for large-scale capital funding are assessed against published prioritisation criteria that were introduced in 2004 following consultation with the education partners.  Under the criteria, each project is assigned a band rating that reflects the type of works required and the urgency attaching to them.  There are four band ratings, with band one being the highest and band four the lowest.  Projects are progressed in accordance with the band rating assigned to them and when funding allows.  This project has a band rating of 2.2, which is consistent with its current brief.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">The project is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  The stage 2(a) submission, which is the developed sketch design stage, was approved in July 2008.  However, due to the competing demands on my Department's capital budget, it was not possible to authorise the project to progress further at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">The proposed building project at the school will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme for 2010.  While I will take account of the issues raised by the Deputy, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.</p>

The Department has spent €150,000 on its design and planning.  It has spent a further €500,000 on the site's purchase despite it not being the preferred site, which would have cost less than half of that.  Will the Minister of State explain why a more expensive site was chosen?</p>

Why was it suspended after going to tender and incurring such an expense?  It is being placed in the GRD scheme and, having lost its place, moved from band one to band two, where 350 schools are ahead of it.  There is no justification for this.  Why was it done to a school with 117 pupils, including a large number of special needs pupils?  The principal's office is in the staff toilet.  No school in the country, not even in the pressure areas of Dublin, Meath and so on, must endure such conditions.</p>

            <p eId="para_239">In 2000, the board of management identified a site that was deemed suitable for the proposed new school building.  The Department gave the board approval to acquire the site on the basis that the Minister would purchase it from the school's management subsequently.  The vendor agreed in writing in a letter to the board of management to the sale of the site in 2003.  In February 2005, however, the vendor wrote to the board to advise it that, as property prices had risen significantly since the site's valuation in 2000, she would request that the price be increased in line with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_240">On 7 April 2005, the Department wrote to the board and asked whether the former could enter into negotiations with the vendor directly.  This was agreed.  In line with what was then normal practice, the OPW identified two other sites as well as the one eventually acquired, as it was the cheapest option.  The deal on the site was formally closed by the OPW in 2007.  The Department is committed to this project, as demonstrated by its purchase of the site in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_241">Will the Minister of State clarify why the school has lost its position?  Despite having been put out to tender, its rating has been lowered and it must compete with 350 other projects for finances and resources within the Department.  Why was there a change from a six-classroom school, which satisfied the board of management, principal and parents?  Was a stalling tactic used and the carrot of eight classrooms held out despite the original tender being for six classrooms?</p>

        <b>Deputy Andrew Doyle</b>

        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the number of appeals made to his Department relating to requests to have local school decisions on expulsions and suspensions overturned in each of the past three years; the number of appeals that were ultimately upheld; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [44245/09]

          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_110" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_249">Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of it expels or suspends a pupil for a period of greater than 20 days or refuses to enrol a student.</p>
            <p eId="para_250">Concerning expulsions, a total of 91 appeals were lodged in 2006 and 69 of these went to hearing, of which 23 were upheld.  In 2007, a total of 76 appeals were lodged and 55 of these went to hearing, of which 13 were upheld.  In 2008, a total of 84 appeals were lodged and 76 of these went to hearing, of which 24 were upheld.</p>
            <p eId="para_251">Regarding suspensions, a total of 8 appeals were lodged in 2006 and five of these went to hearing, of which one was upheld.  In 2007, a total of 11 appeals were lodged and six of these went to hearing, of which three were upheld.  In 2008, a total of 22 appeals were lodged and 14 of these went to hearing, of which nine were upheld.</p>
            <p eId="para_252">The Education Act 1998 provides that parental and student grievances should, in general, be determined in the school concerned.  However, specific provision was made in section 29 of the Act for an appeal to be made to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science against decisions by schools which concern the enrolment, suspension or expulsion of pupils.  I believe that the intention behind this distinction in the legislation is clear.  Suspension and expulsion are very serious decisions that can have a major impact on the education of individual pupils.  In such circumstances, good governance provisions allow for a right of appeal against these decisions.  The most efficient and effective means of doing so is for an independent appeal to a panel of people with the requisite experience of the types of issues that arise at these appeals.</p>
            <p eId="para_253">While the legislation provides for an appeal to be made to the Secretary General of my Department, it specifies that it is to be heard by an independent committee appointed by the Minister.  Each committee consists of a serving school inspector and two other people nominated from a panel appointed by the Minister.  The committee members I have appointed, like those appointed by my predecessors, have essentially been people with previous experience and expertise in the educational field, including a significant number of former school principals with a particular understanding of how schools operate.  This committee, rather than my Department, determines the outcome of the appeal.  Furthermore, there is no provision in the legislation for the Secretary General or any other departmental official to modify or interfere with decisions taken by statutory appeal committees.  The Secretary General of my Department cannot direct a school to enrol or reinstate a pupil unless an appeal under section 29 is upheld.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_111">
            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_254">This is sending out a very bad message to schools.  The Minister has just told the House that over the past three years, one has had a one in two chance of having one's suspension overturned by making an appeal to the Department of Education and Science.  In the case of an expulsion, one's chance is better than one in four.  That says two things.  It tells me that the local decisions of schools about suspensions and expulsions are being second-guessed.  It tells disruptive and unruly pupils that if they appeal local decisions to suspend or expel them to the Department of Education and Science, they have quite a good chance of having such decisions overturned.  We are sending a very dangerous message to school authorities, which are in the best position to make the right decisions on the range of issues involved in these cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_255">In light of the information the Minister has given me today and over the past few months, will he consider examining this issue again?  His predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, introduced legislation in March 2007 to put in place a much tighter framework for ensuring that we support schools when they have to make decisions of this nature.  We need to send a clear message to the tiny minority of students who engage in unacceptable behaviour in our school system that we will take a clear stance against it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_256">One can make one's own case.  One in four appeals has been upheld.  Many cases — 40% of suspensions and 20% of expulsions — are resolved before they go outside the school.  I wish to speak about the system that is in place.  If a better or more efficient system were available, I would consider it.  It is important to examine the structure of the appeals process.  One makes one's appeal to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science, who establishes an independent committee, comprising an inspector from the Department and two other experienced people, to adjudicate on one's case.  As this is a time-bound process. the committee has a specific limit on the amount of time it has to make a decision.  The costs associated with the process are minimal.  Generally speaking, we have to give parents the right of independent appeal.  As it is happening in the health and social welfare systems, it has to happen in the education system.</p>

            <p eId="para_259">It is important to emphasise that each parent has the right to go to court.  Deputy Brian Hayes suggested recently that parents should go to the High Court.  I would like to give some comparative figures in that context.  The facilitation cost of a section 29 appeal is €500.  The price of a full hearing is €1,000.  If a parent opts for a judicial review, he or she would incur a cost of €50,000, as would the school.</p>

            <p eId="para_273">The Deputy will be aware that €252 million is being invested in information and communications technology, ICT, in schools under the national development plan between 2007 and 2013.  The national development plan also required that a detailed ICT strategy be published by my Department to target investment appropriately.  The report of the strategy, Investing Effectively in ICT in Schools 2008-2013, was published by my Department in July 2008.  Investment in ICT in schools has continued since the ICT in schools programme commenced in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_274">In 2007 and 2008, some €12 million was invested in up-skilling teachers in ICT skills, providing curriculum-relevant digital content and software and facilitating the broadband connectivity of schools.  Equipment grants of €2.3 million were provided to new post-primary school building projects in 2008, while €2.2 million was provided to 72 primary schools when newly constructed schools or large-scale extensions reached practical completion.  Grants of €17 million have been issued to 500 post-primary schools since September 2007 to upgrade their facilities to provide the new technology syllabus and the revised design and communication graphics syllabus, T4, subjects.</p>
            <p eId="para_275">By the end of this year, I will have provided funding in excess of €45 million for ICT in schools, including the €22 million grants package recently announced for primary schools, equipment grants of up to €6.2 million for schools where construction work was completed this year or last year and funding for broadband, teacher development and the provision of curriculum digital content.  Earlier this year, I established a joint advisory group to explore with industry possible approaches to implementing the recommendations of the strategy group's report.</p>
            <p eId="para_276">The recommendations of the advisory group have been published in its report, Smart Schools = Smart Economy, which the Taoiseach launched on 16 November last.  The advisory group report recommends an initial investment of €150 million over the next three years.  I am committed to making funding available for ICT in schools over that time.  Some €22 million in grants was issued to primary schools last week as a first step, with the priority on ensuring that there is a teaching computer and digital projector in every classroom.  Funding for post-primary schools will be made available early in the new year.  The total amount of funding to be made available for ICT equipment next year is being considered as part of the overall capital allocation to be agreed by Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_279">Following the publication of the Ryan report, this House passed a unanimous motion calling on the congregations to commit to making further substantial contributions by way of reparation.  In June of this year, the Taoiseach and the relevant Ministers, including me, met representatives of the 18 religious congregations that were party to the 2002 indemnity agreement.  The congregations indicated their willingness to make further contributions.  Any such contributions are separate from the 2002 indemnity agreement and associated contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_280">The Government has made clear that these contributions must be capable of being assessed by the public for their significance by reference to the full resources available to the congregations and in the context of the costs of well over €1 billion incurred by the State.  In this context, the Government appointed a panel of three independent persons to assess the financial statements submitted by the congregations and to report to Government as to the adequacy of these statements as a basis for assessing the resources of the congregations.  The panel submitted its report at the end of October.  The report was examined within my Department and a number of clarifications were sought from the panel.  In response, the panel elaborated on the relevant points within the context of its report and submitted an expanded report on 25 November 2009. Although an overall offer of a contribution on behalf of the congregations collectively was sought, the congregations' responses have been on an individual basis.  I expect to have the complete set of responses from the congregations in the next day or so.</p>
            <p eId="para_281">I will bring the panel's report and details of the congregations' offers of contributions to the attention of the Government at the earliest opportunity.  The position in respect of publication is that while it has always been the intention to publish the conclusions of the panel and the offers from the congregations, the arrangements for publication will be considered by the Government.  In this regard, I am concerned to ensure that the survivors and their representatives are kept fully informed of developments.  Deputies will be aware that some religious congregations have published their individual offers and details of their respective financial positions.  Although the approach taken by an individual congregation is a matter for it, my objective is to have the collective comprehensive position available.</p>
            <p eId="para_282">Once the full position is known, the Government will consider the uses to which the contributions will be put, in consultation with the representatives of the survivors and the congregations.</p>

What has he done, personally, to accelerate the process and ensure the congregations which met collectively with him will provide the information in an effective and proper manner?  This was not money they generated themselves but was taxpayers' money that went into the private coffers of congregations.</p>

            <p eId="para_284">Of course we were disappointed with the progress made.  Did we contact the congregations?  Yes, we did.  The Taoiseach wrote to them as did my Secretary General, giving them a deadline by which time their contributions would be made known.  We are now at a stage where one outstanding contribution is to be made known to me and I understand this will be done during the week.  An e-mail or text message was received within the Department this week, indicating clearly that this congregation would be making its offer.</p>
            <p eId="para_285">At all times, I was conscious we made a commitment to the survivors to keep them briefed as matters progressed.

Why can we not do it to congregations which have cost the taxpayers of this Republic €1.3 billion?</p>

            <p eId="para_290">There are two issues here.  We wanted to do the opposite, namely, not to make the contributions public because I wanted to give the survivors an opportunity to be the first to know, after the Government had considered both the panel report and the offers made.</p>
            <p eId="para_291">With regard to Deputy Quinn's point, the important thing is that when the Taoiseach and other Ministers met them the congregations indicated quite clearly they were prepared to make a substantial contribution.  We now have the panel's report from the three individuals who did an outstanding job and graciously did not charge any fee for it.  That is now available and will go to Government, probably in the week after the budget on the basis of this latest and final offer that came in.  The Government will consider the assets <i>vis-à-vis</i> the cash in hand and the offer made.  It is then a matter for Government to decide where it wishes to go from there.</p>

          <p eId="para_295">I am truly appalled by the contents of the Murphy report which was published last week.  Arising from that report, does the Taoiseach consider it appropriate that persons in authority in the Catholic Church, who knowingly moved paedophile priests from parish to parish should continue to be in positions of authority either in the church or in State-funded institutions?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_140">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_296">I have been very clear on this matter.  The State's job is to ensure everybody is equal before the law and that applies to institutions and individuals.  The State must also ensure that best practice in this entire area will be promoted in the future.  From this and previous reports, we have confirmation that there was an horrific deficit of accountability and these matters were not handled properly.  The reputation of institutions was held to be of higher priority than looking after children and ensuring that anybody who offended was dealt with by the law.  That belongs to that era and needs to be recognised and accepted.  Agencies of the State or people who acted on behalf of the State who similarly were less than proper or appropriate in how they dealt with these matters must be also apologised for and I do that unreservedly on behalf of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">It is for the individuals who are affected by the findings of this report and conclusions to consider in what way they can continue in whatever positions they hold.  It is a matter for them to consider how that is to be dealt with within their own institutions.  There are people considering this now in the context of the report and its implications.  For my part, as Taoiseach, it is important to point out the State holds no brief and must ensure that everyone is amenable before the law.  I will continue to state this openly and candidly.  I hold no brief for anyone who has failed in his duty in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The question of what position individuals should hold within the Catholic Church or any other institution or denomination will have to be addressed through personal reflection and by those with whom they work and to whom they are beholden, including the members of the church and their peers in the clergy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_141">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_299">I am a member of the Catholic Church and note that, in recent days, devout Catholics who have followed the teachings of their church faithfully over very many years are appalled by this position.  They want their church to be a church of the future with a future.  The symbolism of change is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The Archbishop of Dublin said in his pastoral letter on Sunday that child abuse was and always is a crime in civil law and Canon Law.  Those in positions of authority who knowingly moved paedophile priests from parish to parish, thereby allowing them to perpetrate their crimes and destroy children's innocence, should not continue in positions of authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Consider the communications between the Murphy commission and the papal nuncio and Vatican.  It is discourteous that the papal nuncio did not respond to the two letters sent to him by the Murphy commission.  The Vatican, through the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, responded to the Department of Foreign Affairs indicating the communication was not made through the proper channel.  In light of this response, what action was taken by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, who happens to be the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister who presented the Murphy report some days ago?  The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is the equivalent in the Vatican of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister were actively making contact with the British Government and British ambassador about the Barron and McEntee inquiries into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, yet how is it that, in respect of this sensitive issue concerning the destruction of the innocence and lives of vulnerable children, there was no response from the political end of the Department of Foreign Affairs to the response from the Vatican that contact had not been made through the correct channel?  Did the Minister for Foreign Affairs know about this?  Was the Government informed of the response from the Vatican?  Why was no action taken in respect of information in files from the Archdiocese of Dublin submitted to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in Rome?  The lack of action was such that the grievous and evil circumstances that obtained were allowed to continue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_142">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_302">Deputy Kenny asked about the Department's position on what happened.  It is a matter of regret that the Holy See was not in a position to provide a substantive response to inquiries from the commission of investigation of the Dublin Archdiocese.  It is important to be clear as to how and why this occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The commission of investigation wrote to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in September 2006 seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, information on reports of child sexual abuse that had been passed on to the congregation by the Archdiocese of Dublin.  The Holy See responded to that request by diplomatic note, sent by the Vatican Secretariat of State to the Embassy of Ireland to the Holy See in March 2007.  This note made clear the view of the Vatican that, as the commission had been established under the authority of the Government through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, such a communication should be routed through diplomatic channels and in accordance with international laws and customs.  This diplomatic note was forwarded via the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which passed it to Judge Murphy of the commission.  There does not appear to have been any further communication between the commission and the Holy See after that note was passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I understand, however, that the Holy See sought confirmation that the content of its note had been made known to the commission.  That was confirmed to the Holy See and Judge Murphy was informed of the Vatican's interest in knowing the note had been conveyed to the commission.  The Vatican made clear to the Embassy of Ireland to the Holy See that its concern to confirm that the note had been passed on was to avoid any impression that the correspondence from the commission had been ignored.  It is not unreasonable to assume the Holy See was open to responding to a further approach through formal diplomatic channels.  Neither is it unreasonable to assume that when the papal nuncio received correspondence from the commission in February 2007 and earlier this year, both the present and previous papal nuncios believed the matter was more properly addressed by the diplomatic note.  It would not be normal practice for a diplomatic mission to release papers to a body in its country of accreditation without an approach through the host Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">It is regrettable that the failure to acknowledge either letter has given rise to the impression the Holy See was refusing to co-operate with the commission.  The commission notes in its report that, as a body independent of the Government, it did not consider it appropriate to use diplomatic channels and that it was a matter for the commission itself.  The approach by the Holy See was consistent with international law, according to which dealings between states should be conducted via the diplomatic channel unless other arrangements are made by mutual consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The commission and the Holy See, it appears, acted in good faith in this matter, even if the best outcome was not achieved.  It may be that an approach to the Holy See through appropriate diplomatic channels could assist in following up on the commission's report.  This is a matter that the Government can consider, if appropriate, in the context of its response to the report.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_143">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_307">That reply confirms what the problem is and has been, that is, that senior figures in the Catholic Church failed and, in respect of the note, appear to fail now to grasp the urgency of what was at stake.  What was at stake was the widespread abuse of children over a long period.  Every time this arises, the outcome is similar.  Parents and others who went to priests and bishops to say something was going on were blocked and frustrated.  The tracks in the sand were being covered rather than investigated.  The Taoiseach's reply, on diplomatic movements made at different times, appears to confirm this is the approach taken in the Vatican also.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">We are to have a discussion later today on the Murphy report, which report follows the Ryan report and Ferns Report.  There is an investigation ongoing in Cloyne.  Will the remit of the Murphy commission be extended to consider other dioceses where issues have been raised about the abuse of children?  The issue that must be addressed is the State's response.  Does the Taoiseach believe it is acceptable that any bishop who has been criticised in the Murphy report over the failure to deal with the abuse of children should continue to be patron of schools that children attend?</p>
          <p eId="para_309">This is a matter with which the Government can deal.  Section 33 of the Education Act 1998 gives the Minister for Education and Science the power to make regulations governing the terms under which the patronage of schools may be issued.  Could a regulation be made whereby any person criticised for failing to deal with issues of child protection, as identified recently in the Murphy report, would not be allowed to continue as patron of a school with overall responsibility for the school ethos, school governance and the appointment of boards of management and teachers?  I do not understand how people who have been so roundly criticised for their failure to protect children can continue to be patrons of schools.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_144">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_310">Regarding the first part of the question raised by Deputy Gilmore, I was simply setting out the position that these matters are dealt with in that way.  A diplomatic note was sent to the Murphy commission but it was not followed up thereafter, which is unfortunate.  Had the Department of Foreign Affairs or another Department been asked to pursue the issue, perhaps a solution to the problem could have been brought about or we would have been able to confirm the necessary information was made available.  I make that point for the purposes of the factual situation, as outlined to me.  The Director of Public Prosecutions acts in that way when dealing with outside bodies and other such agencies, so, using the diplomatic route is not unique to the current situation.  I would like the commission to have any information it may seek.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">On the other issue raised by the Deputy, namely, the patronage of schools, we have had discussions on it in terms of the evolving policy emerging as a result of different models of management and patronage which established themselves in Ireland over many years by different organisations which have been involved in education.  It is true that in respect of Catholic schools <i>ex officio</i> bishops of the diocese are patrons of the schools.  The schools chose the patron, not the other way around.  There is no executive function for patrons in respect of the management of schools.  It is dealt with through codes of conduct, boards of management and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">In respect of any child protection or other issues which arise in schools, they are dealt with at board of management level.  There is no executive role for a patron.  There is a view that child protection services would be compromised in some way as a result of the current position.  The patron has an <i>ex officio</i> role, arising from the fact that the bishop of any diocese is the patron of the Catholic schools of the diocese.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I will not enter a discussion about who should be a bishop in any particular diocese.  Arising from this report are issues as to whether a person continuing in ecclesiastic office is in the interests of the institution concerned, a matter which must be considered.  We know one person is considering the situation and is talking to priests and other people.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">My basic point is that there is no question of an executive role for patrons in schools.  It is an <i>ex officio</i> position which is historically held by bishops of dioceses, a situation which continues.  While patronage of schools is an issue which is broadening, that is the situation as it currently stands.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_315">The Taoiseach did not respond to the question I put to him on whether he would agree to have the remit of the Murphy commission extended to examine allegations in other dioceses, and I invite him to answer that part of the question.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">In respect of his response about the patronage of schools, it comes as news to me that the patronage of our schools operates on such an <i>ex officio</i>, almost honorary, basis, as described by the Taoiseach.  In this country the bulk of our schools are denominationally controlled through the system of patronage, whereby schools in a diocese are placed under the patronage of the bishop in the diocese concerned.  The bishop has a role in the appointment of a board of management and the chair of the board of management, and is the person who holds power in respect of the schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I agree that who should be a bishop in any diocese is not my business or that of the Taoiseach, but I respectfully suggest that it is the business of Government and the State to determine who should be patrons of schools which are funded by the taxpayer, supported by the State and to which the majority of children in this country go.  I submit to the Taoiseach that anybody who has been criticised in the terms in which the Murphy report has criticised some bishops should not continue to be patrons of schools with the overall responsibility they have for schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Who is bishop in a diocese is a matter for the church and the individuals concerned, but who should be patrons of our schools is a matter for the State.  It is time the State and Government asserted their authority in this area.  It is something which can be done.  It does not have to be dealt with under primary legislation.  The Education Act 1998 is in place and provides that regulations can be made, setting down how patronage can operate.  This is a test of whether we are learning anything from these reports or follow their logic, and whether the Government and the State will stand up to this kind of thing or we will continue with the kind of latter-day deference which gave rise to this problem in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">It is time for the Government to stand up and say, "No".  People who have been found to have neglected their duty and not to have followed up on complaints which were made about the serious abuse of children should not continue to be in powerful positions in respect of schools young children are attending.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_146">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_320">I made the point to the Deputy that while the patron has overall responsibility for the ethos of the school, the implementation of child protection guidelines are primarily the responsibility of the board of management of each school.  The Education Act 1998 makes no provision for the removal of a patron from a school.  The Department of Education and Science has issued guidelines on child protection to schools since 1991 and for the past ten years all schools have been obliged to have child protection policies in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I am making the point that the Deputy is raising a more general policy issue, which relates to the open policy regarding the patronage of schools and who is involved in the boards of management of schools.  A discussion took place in this House several months ago about the need for a forum to reflect the social change in our society and provide modern methods of governance in the future which will involve all stakeholders coming to the table to reflect the diversity in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I have no problem with the policy development which has to take place regarding that.  In terms of the current governance of our schools, there is an <i>ex officio</i> reality that bishops of dioceses are patrons of Catholic schools.  They have no executive role under our legislation——</p>

          <p eId="para_325">On the Murphy report, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, has made it clear that we await the HSE audit in respect of the remaining dioceses and reserve the position of Government in respect of whether any of them require an investigation such as that carried out by the Murphy commission, as happened in the case of Cloyne, when it became clear that there was <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a need to fully investigate the diocese as a result of what came to the attention of the HSE or the Minister’s office.  The issue is clear, and we reserve our position and await the HSE audit so we can decide whether to take the matter further.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">In 2005 the Minister, Deputy Ryan, as an Opposition Deputy criticised the postponement of elections and voted against them on the basis that it was a sorry start to a process.  It is a process we all support.</p>

If one looks at the proposed Order of Business for tomorrow, from after the Order of Business until 7 p.m. there is the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 — Second Stage.  Is it reasonable that we spend nearly seven hours dealing with Second Stage of the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and allow 80 minutes to deal with climate change?</p>
          <p eId="para_489">This debate was supposed to take place after the Order of Business but was changed because of the publication of the Murphy report.

This is a serious issue that people outside are now beginning to take somewhat seriously because of the ongoing flooding in this country from year to year.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Would the Taoiseach kindly arrange that some of tomorrow morning's business be held over for a couple of hours to continue this debate on climate change?  It is a reasonable request.  There are no votes involved.  It is simply an opportunity for Members to express a view and to adopt a combined approach so that the Minister, and the Taoiseach if he goes to Copenhagen, can go with backing from the Dáil and from the Seanad, which, I hope, will also hold a debate.</p>

We all support the change today in terms of the Murphy report, and that is not an issue.  It is of tremendous importance that this Parliament reflects and considers the major task we face at Copenhagen.  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has indicated that he will attend.  I wish the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, well in representing what is a unified view across this House that climate change is our big challenge and that we must work together to ensure we meet our responsibilities.  We failed on Kyoto.  We now must succeed because time is running out.  We should make a special arrangement in terms of having a debate to continue on this subject because the Copenhagen conference is approaching quickly.  Ireland may be a small country but we are a big polluter compared to other populations, and we must ensure that we work together to meet this major challenge of our time.</p>

If it is possible to get some commitment on the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill being handled in less time but with the co-operation of the House, I do not know whether it would be possible for the Whips to consider rearranging the climate change debate to continue tomorrow morning.

          <p eId="para_510">I sent the Taoiseach a note some weeks ago about the Committee of the Regions, which is a European institution.  Prior to the last local elections, the position of his party was much stronger in terms of local government representation than it is now.  The committee, as he will be aware, has nine representatives and nine alternates, and it is supposed to reflect the relative strengths of the parties and gender balance.  In view of the situation that applied on the last occasion, is it the Taoiseach's intention from any point of view of fairness and expression of understanding of the democratic will of the people as declared in that result to change the membership in terms of the representation given to my party, which has vastly increased strength as a result of the people's vote?</p>

          <p eId="para_513">I agree with Deputy Kenny on the appointment of the Committee of the Regions because the Labour Party also has considerably increased representation in local government which would justify increased representation on the Committee of the Regions.  As a result of the referendum in 1999, there is now a constitutional protection of local government.  I hope therefore that the Government will honour that and will respect the result of the local elections last June.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I wish to raise two matters with the Taoiseach.  First, we are just 36 hours away from the second national strike involving the public services.  We have all been encouraged by the fact that talks have taken place, which went on long into the night.  I understand that they are to resume this afternoon.  The House is sitting tonight until approximately 11.30 p.m., so will any opportunity be taken by the Government to report on progress in those talks?</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Second, are any efforts being made to avert the threatened strike on Thursday?  We are already hearing about hospital appointments being cancelled.  In addition, parents with children at school need to know if the schools will be open on Thursday.  Is any effort being made to avert that strike and is sufficient progress being made in the talks?  We are getting mixed messages as to what is happening in the talks.  It would be helpful if the Government were to make a report to the House later this evening on progress in the talks.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">In the course of tomorrow's business will there be an opportunity to get a report by the relevant Ministers on what is happening with the flooding situation, which is still hugely serious in many parts of the country?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_195">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_517">As the Deputy knows, discussions are continuing with the public service unions.  That engagement is continuing this evening, so it would not be helpful for me to say publicly where we are at the moment, other than that there is an engagement taking place.  Work will continue to see if we can find a resolution to the issue, which is sufficient to meet the requirements of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">A day of strike action is not within my remit.  This issue is being dealt with by others.  As I made clear last week, the Government's position is not influenced one way or the other by the existence or prospect of strike action on Thursday.  It is about trying to address the issues as we have outlined them.  We will not be changing our approach because of what others contemplate doing.  The fact is that an engagement is taking place, which is resuming this evening.  We will continue to work and if there is anything to report in terms of an outcome, that matter can be dealt with by the House in due course.  However, I do not envisage having anything further to say about it today.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The Deputy also raised the flooding question.  There are ways and means for Deputies to raise that issue again.  It was dealt with extensively last week by agreement in the House.  As the Deputy said, the situation continues to be serious.  We are continuing to work in accordance with local emergency plans that are in place.  The vagaries of weather patterns, including rainfall, are dictating that response in different parts of the country.  As we have seen, the east was also affected over the weekend.  We will continue to deal with that through the central mechanism of the emergency co-ordination committee and local task forces that are implementing the emergency plans.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_196">
          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_520">On 11 November, I wrote to the Ceann Comhairle about a debate that took place here on 4 November.  During that debate the Minister for Health and Children told me I was wrong to say that the HIA informed me that 12,000 people had cancelled their health insurance.  On the same day I produced a response to a parliamentary question by Deputy Richard Bruton, which clearly showed that 21,000 people were involved, so my claim was accurate.  I have written to the Ceann Comhairle to ask the Minister for Health and Children to correct the record of the Dáil, yet she has failed to do so.  I wonder what arrangements the Ceann Comhairle will put in place to address that.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The second issue I wish to raise concerns pending legislation.  It relates to a discussion we had earlier.  The education (patronage) Bill is to come before the House, yet there is no provision in it for Educate Together to be patrons of a secondary school.  Currently, however, some school patrons have been found to be negligent in their duty to child care.  In the view of many people, they are unsuitable to be patrons if the current personnel remain in place.  I find it difficult to accept that people who are supposedly the moral guardians of our society, do not look to their consciences, as to whether they are right or wrong, and make their decisions on that basis, rather than trying to place the responsibility on the laity or priests.  As others have said, it is up to the church to sort out its own.  However, I would have expected more from individuals within the church who have let themselves and their colleagues down.  They should act in conscience.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">I hope the forthcoming education (patronage) Bill will allow Educate Together to become patrons of secondary schools.  Educate Together has a long 30-year history of involvement in primary schools.  It has been congratulated on its work by President Mary McAleese, and I see no reason that it should not be afforded this opportunity in the proposed legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">I wish to raise the matter referred to by Deputy Gilmore and others concerning the national emergency co-ordination effort and the relevant legislation.  I do not agree with the Taoiseach because there was not the degree of co-ordination at national level that there should be.  Huge initiatives were taken by individual constituent bodies of their own accord.  They were willing and able to help, but much was left undone simply because nobody was in charge at national level.  There was no delegation of authority to local authorities.  Various bodies took the risk of going into the arena and offered to help out.  I ask the Taoiseach to review the construction of this body to try to come to grips with some methodology whereby a decision can be made centrally to activate all services nationally to go to the rescue of those in need at any given time.</p>

          <p eId="para_529">Local emergency plans are in place.  Up to this weekend, the experience is that they have been working very well.  That is the general view of people on the ground.  There may well be individual cases of continuing hardship or delay in getting to those affected by floods.  In many cases, however, priorities have to be established at local level concerning the protection of installations and the provision of water supplies.  A number of steps had to be taken and this was understood by many residents, who themselves were under pressure and in difficulties, when they heard that other things had to be done in the first instance.  People had a sense of organisation and co-ordination about what was going on even in the midst of their own difficulties when flooding was starting to affect their own private property.  I understand the Deputy's view of what happened in his own locality, but my distinct impression based on visiting and talking to people on the ground is that there was a fair deal of satisfaction.  This is a continuing problem and it is not as if we can discuss it as if it is over.  When people's difficulties are not being solved as quickly as they would have hoped, it can cause frustration and other problems to arise as well.  It is an ongoing situation and matters on the ground can change very quickly, too.</p>

          <p eId="para_535">It is not the number of funds we establish that is important, but rather the adequacy of resources for the funding we need to supply.  That is the determining factor in the response.  The whole idea is to have a flexible responsive position established.  As the clean-up issues emerge this question arises as well as for people who cannot access their homes.  At present arrangements are being made by the HSE, primarily for those who have not got a wider family support circle as an option for relocation, so that they can get temporary accommodation.  Local authorities can help engage in that initiative as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_576">I call on the Taoiseach to make his statement under Standing Order 43.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_224">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_577">The Commission of Investigation into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin was appointed in March 2006.  Its report was published last week.  It is a deeply upsetting document.  At the outset, I want to say it is our duty as a society to confront and address the sexual abuse of children and to bring healing to those who have suffered the traumas of abuse.  The greatest tribute we can pay to the courageous victims who brought to light these heinous acts is to redouble our efforts to ensure that this will not happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The commission was appointed, not to detail cases of child abuse, but to report on how the church and State authorities handled a representative sample of allegations and suspicions involving such abuse, against clerics operating under the aegis of the archdiocese of Dublin over the period 1975-2004.  In performing that task, the commission had necessarily to outline the child abuse allegations and suspicions in question, and they make shocking reading.  As the commission says, it is abundantly clear that child sexual abuse by clerics was widespread throughout the period.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The commission drew together a representative sample of 46 priests from the 102 within its remit, out of the approximately 2,800 priests who served in Dublin during this period.  It examined complaints against those 46 in respect of more than 320 children.  Large and awful as that number is, the commission stresses that the true number is likely to be much greater: one priest admitted to abusing more than 100 children, another that he abused on a fortnightly basis for more than 25 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">All of these children were persons entitled to dignity and respect.  That was not how they were treated by the priests who abused them and the damage that was inflicted on them was not confined to the children: both the families they were born into, and the families that many of them subsequently managed to form for themselves, were also victims.  The abuse did not stop there, for when victims found the courage to complain, what they had to say was not listened to and acted on, but ignored and covered up.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">In a report of this nature, one does not look for heroes, but they are there: the victims who took their courage in their hands and came forward and made complaints.  Many of them showed not only great courage but also great determination, patience and persistence, in what were clearly very difficult circumstances, in ensuring that their complaints were brought eventually to light.  We owe them a very deep debt of gratitude for that, and also for their courageous cooperation with the commission.  This report is their vindication.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The report makes two truly remarkable points about the motives of those who made complaints.  When dealing with church authorities, the commission says the main concern of the complainants was the protection of other children: complainants almost invariably inquired about the whereabouts of the abuser and whether or not he had access to other children.  The commission was also impressed by the extraordinary charity shown by complainants and their families towards offenders.  It is very clear, the report says, that complainants frequently behaved in a much more Christian and charitable way than the church authorities did.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The responsibility for the abuse of children belongs to the evil men who did this.  How men ordained for a ministry of love could have done such things to children is impossible to imagine.  How they could have reconciled their consciences with their ministry is also impossible to imagine.  What is no longer impossible to imagine is how they were able to continue to abuse and stay in their ministries for so long, because the commission has investigated that and has set it out for us in graphic detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">I wish to put on the record of the House the Government's gratitude to the members of the commission and its staff for their thorough and painstaking work over more than three years and the clear and cogent way in which they presented what they found.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The detailed description in the report of how the diocesan authorities handled abuse allegations regarding the 46 priests makes deeply shocking reading.  The absence of proper procedures and investigation, the failures of communication both internally in the archdiocese and between it and other church authorities, the lack of sharing of knowledge so that those examining allegations against individual priests would know of the totality of the allegations against them, the "don't ask, don't tell" culture, the non-application of the church's own canon law and the failure to report allegations to the Garda so that the criminal law could be applied, are all carefully detailed.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The whole shocking story can be summarised in a sentence, namely, the church failed to apply its own teaching and put children first.  Alternatively, in the damning words of the commission:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_587">the welfare of children, which should have been the first priority, was not even a factor to be considered in the early stages.  Instead the focus was on the avoidance of scandal and the preservation of the good name, status and assets of the institution and of what the institution regarded as its most important members — the priests.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The report raises very fundamental questions for the church.  While the report acknowledges the contribution made by the archdiocese to the lives of our citizens, which should be acknowledged, the sins of omission and commission that the report found should be food for the most sombre reflection, especially in the context of Christmas, when the church celebrates the birth of its founder.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The fault for the cover-up lies primarily with the authorities in the diocese but there also were failings by agencies of the State.  The statement issued by the Government on publication of the report already has stated, and as Taoiseach I repeat it formally in this House, that whatever the historical and societal reasons for this, the Government on behalf of the State apologises, without reservation or equivocation, for the failures by the agencies of the State in dealing with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The report makes a number of adverse findings against the Garda Síochána in about half a dozen cases both regarding inappropriate contacts between the Garda and the archdiocese and the fact that a number of very senior gardaí in past years clearly regarded priests as being outside their remit.  There are also examples of gardaí actually reporting complaints to the archdiocese rather than investigating them and some of the Garda investigations that did take place were cursory.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">However, the report was also impressed with the actions of some gardaí and the manner in which they investigated some individual cases.  It makes the point that many of the complainants who gave evidence to the commission praised the professionalism they encountered in the specialist child sex abuse unit in Harcourt Square, Dublin.  I am glad to acknowledge the work of those gardaí who acted correctly and professionally when allegations of abuse were brought to their attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Members will be aware that Garda Commissioner Fachtna Murphy issued a statement last week on publication of the report expressing his sorrow that, in some cases, individuals who sought assistance did not always receive the level of response or protection which any citizen in trouble is entitled to expect from the Garda Síochána.  I welcome his statement and the commitment therein to ensuring that confidence in and the effectiveness of the investigation methods of the Garda Síochána are such that abusers cannot draw a cloak of fear and mistrust around their crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The Commissioner outlined a number of initiatives being taken by the Garda in this area.  These include the establishment of a crime-training faculty to train senior investigating officers, incident room managers and detectives; the training and appointment of specialist child interviewers throughout the country; the establishment and roll-out of dedicated child interview suites in each region; and the development and implementation of a youth and children strategy from 2009 to 2011.  After pointing out that the Garda Síochána has the expertise and determination to investigate these despicable crimes and having assured victims that when they ask for Garda help they will get it, the Commissioner went on to appeal directly to victims and their families to contact the Garda and to report abuse.  A dedicated telephone line has been established for this purpose.  I repeat the Commissioner's appeal for anyone who has been abused, and their families, to contact the Garda and report the abuse as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The report finds no fault with current Garda handling of complaints and is quite complimentary about current Garda arrangements for handling such complaints.  Nevertheless, after consulting with the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, intends to ask the Garda Inspectorate to review Garda handling of allegations of child sexual abuse to ensure that Ireland is in line with best international practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">There also is the question of criminal liability arising from the response of church and State authorities to allegations of abuse outlined in the report.  The Commissioner has asked an assistant commissioner to examine the report's findings relating to the handling of complaints and investigations and make recommendations to him.  The Commissioner will then consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions as to what issues arise in the context of criminal liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The report also had comments to make about the HSE and its predecessors, the health boards, and about the legislative powers available for the protection of children against child abuse, including abuse by non-family members.  Members will recall that after the publication of the Ryan report last May, the Government asked the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, to draw up a plan to implement its recommendations.  The Minister of State announced that implementation plan, which involves some 99 actions to improve the delivery of children's services, in July and it is being put into action.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Exchange of soft information, that is, information which is available to authorities but where the person to whom the information relates has not been charged or convicted of a criminal offence, is a highly important aspect of child protection.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews's Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in co-operation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has commenced the process of preparing heads of a Bill in respect of the use of soft information and of consulting other Departments, the Garda Síochána and the HSE regarding the draft heads.  At a cross-departmental level, it has been agreed that a single statutory agency should have responsibility for the management of all information, hard and soft, on child abuse in this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The heads of the Bill on soft information that will be presented to the Government will include a proposal that the Garda vetting unit, based in Thurles, will be put on a statutory basis and that this statutory body will have responsibility for the management of all soft and hard information.  The proposal envisages an agency led by the Garda with the HSE and other relevant bodies working alongside it, which will be similar in structure to the Criminal Assets Bureau, which has elements from the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs co-located together under Garda leadership.  The findings of the commission's report about collection and sharing of information will be taken fully into account in this process.  The proposed legislation will need to have regard to the constitutional rights of persons, including the right to equality before the law, the right to a good name, the right to privacy and the right to earn a livelihood.  It also must address the right to fair procedures and have regard to the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">In addition to this legislation, a revised edition of the Children First guidelines is to be published shortly and the guidelines will be promulgated throughout the public service.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is committed to the preparation of legislation to ensure that State employees and staff from key agencies in receipt of Exchequer funding and who are working with children will have a duty to comply with the Children First guidelines.  The commission's report expresses concern about the statutory powers of the Health Service Executive to deal with child sexual abuse by non-family members.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is consulting further with the Office of the Attorney General to seek clarity in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">However, in the wake of the publication of the Ferns Report in 2005, legal advice was sought from the Attorney General regarding the powers of health boards or the HSE as it now is, to investigate and deal with instances of child abuse perpetrated outside the family.  The Attorney General was not of the view that the HSE's powers under section 3 of the Child Care Act 1991 are limited to cases of intra-family abuse.  The HSE has stated that it responds to all allegations of child sex abuse regardless of the circumstances of the allegation.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">It is only fair to record that practices in the archdiocese of Dublin and in the Catholic church generally have moved on considerably from what is described in the report.  However, Deputies will be aware that the HSE is conducting an ongoing audit of all Catholic church dioceses.  The audit aims to ensure that the HSE is fully aware of all clerical child sex abuse known to the church, including the whereabouts of alleged perpetrators.  The HSE issued a detailed questionnaire to all dioceses during the summer and has received completed replies from the bishop in each diocese.  HSE child care managers are in the process of meeting individual bishops to clarify issues arising from the completed questionnaires.  A full report from the HSE is expected imminently setting out the national findings.  A similar audit process is also well under way with religious orders and the HSE will furnish a further report setting out those findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The commission's report has thrown an appalling light on the practices of the archdiocese of Dublin in the past in dealing with, or more truly, in covering up, allegations against priests of child sex abuse.  The abuse, even in the sample examined, was perpetrated against a large number of children.  Their sufferings, and the damage done to the families into which they were born and the families that many of them managed later to create for themselves, can be only imagined.  The behaviour of the priests who abused them was corrupt and evil.  The failure of the church authorities to follow their own teachings, put children first and act decisively against the perpetrators was deeply immoral, shameful and scandalous.  The State too, despite courageous and appropriate action by individuals, was guilty of many failings.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">There have been improvements in the practice of the archdiocese of Dublin, and of the Catholic church in Ireland generally, regarding the care of children and in dealing with allegations and reporting them to the civil authorities.  The State is conducting an ongoing audit into the current practices of every diocese in Ireland and its findings will be published shortly.  The State is also taking various other actions and preparing legislation to further improve the protection of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The shame and horror, however, of this report must remain in the minds of every cleric in the Catholic church, of every member of the church and of every citizen to ensure every one of us puts the protection of children where it should always have been and must be from now on — first.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_225">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_605">I speak on the Murphy report as a citizen, a husband, a father and a Catholic.  It is with a degree of pain that I will say what I have to about the conduct of the church of which I am a member.  When someone reasonably famous dies, the easy comment to make on their passing is that it marks the end of an era.  The publication of the Murphy report does too.  It marks the end of an era of trust in the Catholic church as we knew it.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The Ferns Report was deeply disturbing but it left the hope that such assaults on the innocence of children had, perhaps, only happened in this area.  The Ryan report was equally disturbing, particularly because of the graphic nature of its presentation.  Even as we condemn the callous and uncaring cruelty of the religious into whose hands were delivered generation after generation of little children, we in this House knew the first most deadly trauma of being torn asunder from family, and everything familiar, to be incarcerated in a penal institution was delivered by the State in our name.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Now the Murphy report has been published and we are left in no doubt.  The events it examined did not just happen 50 years ago but went right up into the years of this decade.  The era when the officers of the Catholic church were revered, trusted, depended upon, even kowtowed to, ended last week with the publication of the Murphy report.  Nothing will ever restore the church to its former position.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">However, that is to speak of an institution.  Sadness and loneliness and unearned shame do not happen to an institution.  Instead, they are suffered by individuals.  Individuals, like the priests all across the archdiocese of Dublin who, having always done their job to the highest standards, nevertheless had to turn to face a congregation this Sunday to read a pastoral letter aloud.  I hope those men — and the men and women in congregations who were never abusive to children in their care — understand the public admires the courage and continued commitment of the good religious and good priests serving this nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">Good religious have always stayed focused on human beings.  The tragedy is the bishops who protected paedophile priests seem to have lost sight of their victims.  They protected the system at the expense of the people.  They managed the way Enron was managed, through doctoring the figures, concealing the reality and ignoring the consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The Catholic church throughout the 20th century was run by men who were hugely powerful and influential.  They chose to use their power and influence in ways that left thousands of the faithful lost, damaged, destroyed.  They could not believe the accusations could be true of one of their own men.  In the face of any complaint, they closed ranks repeatedly against children and their families.  They protected their own because their own men mattered.  The human beings accusing those men of filthy actions, immoral behaviour and of repeated rapes of children did not matter.  It was "Us and Them"; the "Us" being those who have taken holy orders and were, therefore, better than "Them", the laity.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">That elitism allowed the protection and promotion of men who should never have been allowed near the priesthood.  It allowed officers of the church who were not themselves paedophiles to dismiss the allegations of children as the product of attention seeking.  It allowed them to dismiss the complaints of parents as motivated by the desire for attention or money.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Diarmuid Martin, in his response to the Murphy report told a simple truth that must not be overlooked.  He said when parents came with their stories of assault and intrusion, they came to make sure what had happened to their child never happened to another child.  That is the truth — the Christian truth.  Parents who could simply have gone to the Garda, instead went quietly to the church they loved in an effort to protect other children.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">Their generosity and concern, however, was rejected.  Their children were interrogated, as if they were involved in some bizarre plot to damage good men.  The officers of the church who dealt with them seemed to have forgotten the gospels.  Nowhere in the gospels does Christ dismiss a cry of pain or ignore a need.  When his apostles tried to shoo children away from his presence, he stopped them and said, "Suffer the little children".  Two thousand years later the very men who ran the church turned that philosophy on its head.  By their actions, they said, "Let the little children suffer".  And suffer they did.  God love them, how they suffered and continue to suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Child abuse is a trauma that never goes away, a wound that never heals.  How could it?  Imagine an eight year old assaulted by a clergyman.  A family friend, who is trusted, respected and loved, suddenly is doing things the child does not or cannot understand.  The trusted figure wraps these actions in both treats and threats.  Treats like trips and sweets; threats like no one believing such stories with the child beaten for lying.  We know abuse leaves a reflex of fear and dread and suspicion in abused children, so that every affectionate touch became suspect, every loving instinct within themselves corrupted and tainted.  The men who violated children were clever, manipulative and charming people who frightened many children into silence.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Some, however, spoke up out of the confusion and shame.  They spoke up and were believed by parents who acted with wisdom and compassion.  They went to the church officials and told their story, only to find themselves dismissed, postponed, ignored, shunned and isolated.  Their children were characterised as both wicked and untrustworthy.  The officers of the church compounded the horrors visited on children by behaving as if those children were born liars out to do gratuitous damage to the priesthood.  These were children who came of devout families who once had a fervent faith.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">As we look at the appalling figures, we must never forget the unrepresented victims — the silent victims.  For fear of being disbelieved, some never told.  For fear of hurting their parents, others never told.  For shame, because they thought, wrongly, they must be in some way to blame for the filthy thing being done to them, yet more never told.  For every child who was immediately believed, how many were walloped and told not to be making up stories about a good man?  For every child whose parents took immediate effective action, how many others were told to keep quiet and just keep clear of Father X?</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The end result of this mismanagement is that men who abused were sent to another parish to new children to abuse.  The officers of the church protected their own and freed men to do it all over again.  They fooled themselves that it was an aberration.  They convinced themselves that protection against being wrongly accused was more important than permanent, lifelong damage to children.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">A recent newspaper report indicated that one man was <i> </i>wrongly accused.  He stood aside from his ministry while investigations took place.  We can all imagine the agony of that man, knowing people were canvassing among themselves the possibility that his hands might have violated the innocence of a child in the parish.  We can imagine the misery of the man, on his own, exercising no priestly functions, with all the time in the world to consider what people might be thinking about him.  The adage that a man is innocent until proven guilty is one that must leave a peculiar taste in the mouth of a man in that position.  However, in that one case, the man was<i> </i>proven innocent.  He went back to work.  It was as simple, extraordinary and admirable as that.  By vindication and courage he showed faith and trust in his own belief and in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">None of that courage, faith, and trust in people or the future was shown by countless officers of the church presented with evidence that children had been abused.  Instead, what was shown was denial, evasion, irresponsibility and a dreadfully sophisticated word process.  I was saddened as a citizen at one of the most shocking aspects of that word process, which took the form of a cardinal explaining to the commission, as if it was valid and acceptable, the concept of "mental reservation" which allowed him to mislead, not just victims, but the people of this country.  By changing tenses and words here and there, a leading churchman with the lives and well-being of children in his care misled victims and media about paying for the defence of a priest who was a paedophile.  How far the church has fallen is painfully illustrated by the fact that some people believe there was nothing wrong in what he did.  Others did follow up each and every complaint with a passion.  Those who did not look back at the records of complaint trailing men who had been convicted, failed in their duty of care to the children of the faithful.  Those may be good men in all other respects — I have no doubt that many are — but as a Catholic and a father I cannot believe that any other virtues or competences outweigh the failure to prevent child rape.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Those children are grown up now and the scars are not readily evident.  Yet, they carry them and will carry them for life.  Their every relationship, every response will be influenced to a greater or lesser extent by what was done to them.  It is no wonder they talk bitterly of churchmen making vague statements about regret for any pain or hurt suffered, when what victims want is that men who stood idly by, to coin a phrase, should now say and do something quite different.  They want those men to say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_621">I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I didn't believe you or ensure that you were believed.  I'm sorry I didn't move heaven and earth when you came to us in trust and home.  I'm sorry one of our men raped or groped you and in the process destroyed your innocence and childhood.  I'm sorry that I concentrated on avoiding the giving of scandal as if the church's long term survival could be built on concealment of the truth and I am now prepared to resign and step down as a symbol of change.  Let the law, both Canon and civil, take its course.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The obfuscation and self-protection of those who ignored the truth told by children will never be forgotten.  It has irreparably damaged the Catholic church in this country and in the world.  The tragedy is that some priests and bishops did more damage to the children and to the church than the initial offences could ever have done, because they forgot what their church stood for.  They abandoned its values and stopped believing promises such as, "The truth will set you free".  They applied sophistry and avoidance where honesty, trust, compassion and care were required.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">Abused children grew up and grew old in secrecy and silence.  They were the walking wounded, trying to make sense of a world out of which a priest had torn the trust, hope <i> </i>and innocence.  The State has been rightly condemned for its role in harvesting children for religious institutions.  Deputies Alan Shatter and Charles Flanagan will deal with the inadequacies of the State and its agencies.  The State cannot gloss over the complicity of those who concealed, postponed and denied.  It may well be, that with deliberate forgetfulness, enough evidence has been lost to ensure the safety of those who concealed and denied the pain of children.  However, if action can be taken, let it be taken.  Let that action be taken in the name of the church, in the wreckage of which the faithful now stand.  Let it be taken in the name of the State that gave those who concealed prestige and power.  Let it also be taken in the name of the generations of children who suffered and parents who watched them suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">I support the Taoiseach in giving priority to the legislative changes that are required to ensure that the State never allows anything such as that to happen again, and that we put in place structures and legal conditions as will be outlined by many Deputies.  I have given my views about those who knowingly moved paedophile priests from parish to parish.  The Murphy report is a sad litany of abuse following other sad litanies of abuse.  There will be others in the future if further reports are done.  It behoves us in this House to do what we can in a right and proper fashion to ensure that innocence and trust is not destroyed by the groping hands of predators on the innocence of young children.  If we as legislators and elected representatives of the people fail in that duty then we will fail the generations to come.  For our part, we will support the Government to give priority to legislation to deal with the issue in as comprehensive a fashion as is necessary and appropriate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_226">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_625">This is the second time within the space of a just a few months that we have come into the House to debate a report which outlines an appalling story of the abuse of young children; the second time within a few months that the public has been shocked to its core by what has emerged.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">In the case of the Ryan report, it was a shocking and sordid saga of the systematic abuse and neglect of thousands of Irish children who were handed over by the State into the custody of religious orders over a period of more than three decades.  In the case of the Murphy report, it is an equally shocking account of the systematic sexual abuse of young children in the archdiocese of Dublin and what was clearly a cold and calculated attempt to cover up offences, protect the abusers and leave children exposed to further danger and attack.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">The uncovering of systematic abuse of children is a test as to whether the State has finally come of age and abandoned its decades-long practice of deference and subservience to authority.  The real test for us in these situations is whether we, as a Parliament, and the Government, as the Executive authority in the country, are prepared to learn the appropriate lessons and to take steps, to the extent that this is possible, to ease the damage done to victims and to ensure that such abuses can never occur again.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">It is true that the very act of commissioning a statutory report into the handling by church authorities of allegations and suspicions of child sexual abuse by clerics was a major milestone.  That would have been inconceivable a generation ago, but it is not good enough to publish the report, express our collective shock and horror and then leave it at that.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">When the Ryan report was published last July, I spoke about this culture of deference that had, for far too long, characterised the relationship between church and State.  I also said that Judge Ryan's report had put paid, once and for all, to the illusions some might still have harboured that the sexual, physical and emotional abuse of children could be explained away as the isolated actions of some abusive individuals.  The overwhelming evidence of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was that abuse was the culture of these institutions, not the exception.  The other fact laid so clearly before us by the Ryan report was how the wider Irish society colluded with the incarceration and abuse of children in religious institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">A blind eye was turned by all institutions of authority and by society at large.  Again and again, the needs of the religious congregations which ran the institutions were put before the needs of the vulnerable children in their care, and not just by the congregations themselves.  That deference to authority and the silence it engendered cost tens of thousands of children their childhoods and, for many, their chance to live a full and healthy life as adults.  Judges Ryan and Murphy have ensured that we know now the full horror — the systematic terror and abuse — that characterised the lives of so many vulnerable children at the hands of those who were supposed to promote and protect their welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">We have a duty to make amends to these survivors.  We know now what Judge Murphy and her colleagues have uncovered and we are grateful to them for their hard work for more than three years.  The question is what we do with that knowledge and how we re-orient the structures of our State and our public services to ensure this can never happen again.  The Murphy report makes grim reading.  Its central finding is that it is abundantly clear that child sexual abuse by clerics in the Dublin Archdiocese was widespread from 1975 to 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The Murphy commission considered and rejected the excuses offered by the church for its actions and inaction in response to this widespread criminal activity. The commission rejected the claim that archdiocesan officials lacked an appreciation of the phenomenon of clerical child sex abuse or its scale.  It considered and rejected the claim that church authorities were "on a learning curve" about the matter.  It pointed out that taking out insurance was an act proving knowledge of child sexual abuse as a potential major cost to the archdiocese. The commission considered the role of canon law and discovered that, rather than sheltering behind the rules of the church, the archdiocese had not even implemented its own canon law rules.  The rules of the church had "fallen into disuse and disrespect".</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The commission's conclusion is that the archdiocese's preoccupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the church and the preservation of its assets.  It states: "All other considerations, including the welfare of children and justice for victims, were subordinated to these priorities."  The reaction of church authorities to reports of clerical child sexual abuse was to ensure that as few people as possible knew of the individual priest's problem.  There was little or no concern for the welfare of the abused child or for the welfare of other children who might come into contact with the priest.  Complainants were met with denial, arrogance and cover-up, and with incompetence and incomprehension in some cases.  Suspicions were rarely acted on.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The report also makes it clear there were very significant failures on the part of the State authorities.  It is clear that Garda authorities, in particular, connived in this practice of cover-up.  There were inappropriate contacts between the Garda and the archdiocese, and the relationship between some senior gardaí and some priests and bishops was inappropriate.  A number of very senior members of the Garda clearly regarded priests as being outside their remit.  Against that backdrop, particular credit is due to those gardaí, most of whom were lower rank, who did their duty without fear or favour.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">It was not until November 1995 that Archbishop Connell allowed the names of 17 priests about whom the archdiocese had received complaints to be given to the Garda.  However, even at that stage, the figure was not complete.  At that time there was knowledge within the archdiocese of at least 28 priests against whom there had been complaints.  In summary, there is no arguing with the conclusions of the Murphy commission that clerical child sexual abuse was covered up by the Archdiocese of Dublin over much of the last quarter of the last century; that the State authorities facilitated the cover-up, by not ensuring that the law was applied equally to all and by allowing church institutions to be beyond the reach of the normal law enforcement processes; that the welfare of children, which should have been the first priority, was not even a factor to be considered; and that the focus was on the avoidance of scandal and the preservation of the good name, status and assets of the institution and the priests.  In particular, I welcome and endorse the commissioners' remarks:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_636">In the mid 1990s, a light began to be shone on the scandal and the cover up.  Gradually, the story has unfolded.  It is the responsibility of the State to ensure that no similar institutional immunity is ever allowed to occur again.  This can be ensured only if all institutions are open to scrutiny and not accorded an exempted status by any organs of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">As public representatives and legislators we have a particular responsibility.  It is not enough for us to identify and decry the wrongdoings of the past, especially the wrongdoings of others.  This report, together with the earlier report of the Ryan commission and a number of other reports published over the years dealing with child protection and the lack of it, should set a Government and Oireachtas agenda for action.  I will identify some examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">First, the Murphy report points out that the HSE has only a very minor role in dealing with child sexual abuse by non-family members.  It remarks that the HSE has given the impression to church authorities and the Garda that it can do more in the area than it actually has the power to do.  The report says that the legislation governing the role of the HSE is inadequate, even for that limited role.  Specifically, the Child Care Act 1991 does not sufficiently clarify the powers and duties of the health authorities.  We must, therefore, legislate to clarify exactly what the role of the HSE is with regard to non-family abusers and to set out clearly the powers it has to implement that role.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">In that regard, I note that the Government response to the Ryan report was published on 28 July.  It contains 99 commitments, but only one of these is a commitment to law reform.  That commitment, that public servants and employees of publicly funded bodies must adhere to the Children First guidelines, will have no impact on persons or bodies which do not receive public funds and which have authority over children.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and the Government must re-examine their priorities on foot of the Murphy report and must strengthen the remit and powers of the HSE and other State agencies.  Whatever else we have learned, we are all surely in agreement that the State has the primary responsibility for ensuring that children are protected from sexual abuse and that when abuse does take place it is properly investigated and appropriate action is taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Second, the legislation to deal with the exchange and use of "soft" information by regulatory bodies, as recommended by the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children in 2008, is clearly relevant and necessary.  The legislation must be brought forward as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Third, shocking as the extent of the abuse that has been revealed is, I believe the organised cover-up will cause most anger.  Innocent children continued to be exposed to the risk of serious sexual abuse.  It is true that many of those who were involved directly in the abuse and in the cover-up are now dead and no longer amenable to the law.  However, there is an obligation on the State authorities to make up for its previous failings by now ensuring that anyone still alive who was involved in the abuse or whose failures to act amounted to criminal offences are brought to justice at the earliest possible time.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">Fourth, we must re-examine our criminal laws as they relate to cover-ups such as this.  Do we have adequate legislation to punish those who withhold information about the commission of serious offences against children?  We have laws that prohibit impeding the apprehension or prosecution of a person one knows or believes to have committed a serious offence.  However, the offence is aimed at action rather than inaction.  In other words, mere inaction or mere failure to disclose highly relevant information is not an offence.  Since 2006, it is a crime to intentionally or recklessly endanger a child by causing or permitting any child to be placed or left in a situation of substantial risk.  Again, however, that new offence does not relate to covering up an offence that has already been committed.  If we believe that the cover-ups dealt with in the Murphy report should be prohibited, something more is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Under the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, a new offence of withholding information about serious offences was introduced.  It applies to offences punishable by five years imprisonment or more.  However, this applies to all offences that involve "loss of human life, serious personal injury, false imprisonment or serious loss of or damage to property or a serious risk of any such loss, injury, imprisonment or damage" except sexual offences.  In other words, sexual offences are specifically excluded from its ambit, although all serious injuries to the person and serious damage to property are covered.  As a result, it is an offence under emergency legislation for a teacher to fail to report to a garda his or her belief that a child was seriously assaulted in the home, but not if it was a sexual assault.  We need to bring some clarity to this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Whether bishops implicated in the Murphy report resign from ecclesiastical positions is a matter for the church.  However, whether any such bishop should remain as a patron of a school or otherwise continue in the management or supervision of education or health provision for children should most certainly be a matter for the State.  Therefore, where a bishop has been directly implicated in the Murphy report, he should have no role as a school patron or a hospital board chairman.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Effective implementation of child welfare and protection policy in our schools, hospitals and other institutions must be the paramount consideration.  The patrons and members of school boards of management and their equivalents in health agencies must be persons whose integrity, competence and suitability have not been called into question as a result of a public investigation like this.  The State has a duty to ensure that this is so.  It is the Government's job to take the necessary action to implement it.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I was disappointed with the Taoiseach's reply to me during Leaders' Questions when I put this point to him.  The Government and the State can act on this issue.  As the Taoiseach stated, we cannot declare who should be bishop in a particular diocese, but the State can determine who can be patrons of our schools.  Under sections 10 and 11 of the Education Act 1998, it is a condition for the recognition of a school, thereby allowing it access to public funding, that the Minister is satisfied that the school complies with health, safety and building standards as are determined by law and any further such standards that are determined from time to time by him or her and that the patron agrees that the school should operate in accordance with any regulations by the Minister under section 33 of the Act and with any other terms and conditions as may reasonably be attached to recognition by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Section 33 allows the Minister to make regulations relating to the recognition of schools and its withdrawal, but no such regulations have been made.  I am calling for a ministerial regulation to the effect that, having regard to the need to ensure the effective implementation of child welfare and protection policy, the patron and members of the board of management of a recognised school must be persons whose integrity, competence or suitability have not, in the opinion of the Minister, been called into question as a result of any public investigation or inquiry authorised by law.  This can be done now.  The Government can determine that any bishop or person who has been found to have been negligent in dealing with allegations of child sexual abuse and who has been criticised in the terms clearly set out in the Murphy report can and should be stood down as patron of a school.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I note the Murphy commission's satisfaction that there are now effective structures and procedures in operation in the Dublin archdiocese.  In particular, the commission was satisfied that all complaints of clerical child sexual abuse made to the archdiocese and other church authorities are now reported to the Garda.  While acknowledging that the current archdiocesan structures and procedures are working well, the commission was concerned that they were heavily dependent on the commitment and effectiveness of two people, the archbishop and the director of the Child Protection Service.  It is for the State to develop, maintain, implement and enforce child protection and welfare guidelines that ensure all bodies, public and private, have embedded institutional structures that ensure an ongoing and effective commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">We must also consider the future of the Murphy commission itself.  It already has further work to do.  The Government has referred to it the report of the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland on the diocese of Cloyne.  We now know the full extent of the shocking abuse that went on in the Dublin archdiocese.  We know from the report published in 2005 that there was a similarly sorry and sordid story in the diocese of Ferns.  We also know from the January 2009 report of the national board that there were serious problems in the diocese of Cloyne, which are now being examined by the Murphy commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">If there were such extensive incidences of child abuse and systematic cover-up in three dioceses, how can we safely assume that there were not problems in other parts of the country?  We cannot and we owe it to any victims of child abuse to bring out the truth, no matter how long it takes or who stands to be embarrassed by the findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The Murphy commission has done an exceptional job of work in examining the Dublin archdiocese.  Notwithstanding the considerable additional burden that would be placed on the members of the commission, the Taoiseach should ask them if they would be willing to continue its work to cover other areas of the country and to make the appropriate order required.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">I join the commission in paying special tribute to the complainants who gave evidence before it.  I have no doubt that reliving their experiences was extremely painful.  The commission itself states that it was left in no doubt about the devastating effect child sexual abuse can have not just on victims, but on their families of origin and the families they create subsequently.  These witnesses were giving evidence not just on their own behalf, but as a public service.  Their evidence was instrumental in helping the commission to examine properly the catalogue of secrecy, cover-up and inaction in which the church authorities indulged.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">One lesson we must learn is that the vast majority of those who were abused as children complained when they were adults.  In almost all cases, they said that they did not complain as children because they did not think they would be believed or because the abuser had told them not to tell anyone.  We must never again rear a generation of children who are taught to kowtow to authority and to believe their complaints will not be taken seriously.</p>

          <p eId="para_655">Tá aiféala orm go bhfuil orainn déileáil le tuairisc dá leithéid seo.  Is trua mór é gur loic iad siúd a bhí i suíomh údarásach thar na blianta ar an dualgas a bhí acu.  I roinnt cásanna, thugadar tacaíocht dóibh siúd a bhí ag baint mí-úsáide ghránna as páistí.  Rinneadar neamhaird air, nó chabhraíodar leis an cover-up ar na coireanna i gcoinne na bpáistí.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The report of the Commission of Investigation into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin exposes glaringly how the most powerful men in the Catholic church in the Dublin diocese conspired to protect abusers of children.  Especially damning is the conclusion that the State authorities facilitated the cover-up and allowed the church to operate beyond the reach of normal law enforcement.  Senior gardaí, up to and including the level of Commissioner, repeatedly turned a blind eye to crimes of clerical sexual abuse.  They colluded in crime, in depraved sexual attacks and in an abuse of power and influence.  They perverted the course of justice and protected the guilty.  Like many others, I believe the paedophile priests and the bishops, archbishops and gardaí who protected them are culpable in the deaths by suicide of many abused children or later adults whose lives were destroyed by the paedophiles and their protectors.  We are discussing children.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I am calling for an inquiry into each and every diocese.  Child sexual abuse on the systematic scale of which we read in the harrowing report from Judge Yvonne Murphy was not just confined to the Dublin or Ferns dioceses, as we saw in the case of the harrowing Ferns Report.  Rather, the abuse was widespread and visited on children in every diocese.  Society owes it to those children it failed to protect in the past to expose the wrongs done to them and to ensure that every step is taken to pursue the perpetrators of abuse and those who failed, or purposely refused, to carry out their duties to protect children.  These crimes must be investigated and the criminals prosecuted.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">The Murphy report describes the gross betrayal of generations of children by powerful people in clerical and State authorities.  It is a reminder of the truth of the saying that "power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely".  The hierarchical, male-dominated structure of the Catholic church has given bishops almost absolute power in their own dioceses.  This has been a recipe for disaster over many years, especially for any child who has been a victim of abuse by clerics.  The report puts it in very clear terms:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_659">The Dublin Archdiocese's pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid 1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the Church, and the preservation of its assets.  All other considerations, including the welfare of children and justice for victims, were subordinated to these priorities.  The Archdiocese did not implement its own canon law rules and did its best to avoid any application of the law of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The report makes it clear that bishops in Dublin ignored the church's own rules on abuse:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_661">The authorities in the Archdiocese of Dublin and the religious orders who were dealing with complaints of child sexual abuse were all very well educated people.  Many had qualifications in canon law and quite a few also had qualifications in civil law.  This makes their claims of ignorance very difficult to accept.  Child sexual abuse did not start in the 20th century.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">The report strongly refutes the claim of the archdiocese and other church authorities that they were on a learning curve, prior to the late 1990s, in respect of the clerical abuse of children.  This was a convenient date for such a claim because it was in 1994 that the extent of this abuse began to be realised by the public, when the Brendan Smyth case came to light.  The learning curve claim is a lie because senior clerics as far back as Archbishop John Charles McQuaid in the 1950s, and almost certainly long before him, were well aware of these cases and were covering them up.  This was a cover-up on a scale never before seen.  The Murphy report shows the extent to which the perpetrators of child abuse and their masters were willing to go with the cover-up, the aim of which was "the protection of the reputation of the institution and the reputation of priests".  Why should we believe this cover-up did not extend beyond Dublin?  That it did extend beyond Dublin will be exposed by other reports of this nature, dealing with other dioceses.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Difficult questions must be asked about Church and General, which was the insurance company involved in this matter.  What was the extent of its knowledge of the matter?  Why were its files shredded?  Will there be a Garda investigation into the role of this company?  Will the Garda themselves be held accountable?  The report tells us that a number of senior gardaí, including the Commissioner in 1960, regarded priests as outside the remit of the force.  Essentially, gardaí bowed down to the hierarchy, at a terrible cost to those children whom the Garda, and the State in general, were supposed to protect.  Anyone, including gardaí, who is found to be complicit in the cover-up of child sexual abuse must face the full rigours of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">The Government must take immediate steps in response to the Murphy report's finding that the existing legislation governing the role of the HSE in dealing with child sexual abuse is inadequate.  There is a need to clarify that role.  The report states that it is of great concern that "the HSE and the health boards have given the impression to Church authorities and the Gardaí that they can do more in the area than they actually have the power to do" and that "the health boards and the HSE do not properly record cases of clerical child sexual abuse".  The Government must immediately rectify the major concern, as highlighted in the report, whereby "the Child Care Act 1991 does not sufficiently clarify the powers and duties of the health authorities".</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The report states that over many years, there was little or no concern for the welfare of abused children or other children who might come into contact with abuser priests.  All four archbishops in the period covered by the report — McQuaid, Ryan, McNamara and Connell — failed to report knowledge of child sexual abuse throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  As I read the disturbing accounts of abuse that are contained in the report, it galled me most that in many cases there was no sense of remorse, or of having done wrong.  These abusers and their protectors lectured the public about morality and wrongdoing.  These twisted perverts were given a signal by archbishops in Dublin over the years, in the form of the impunity or blind eye that was turned to the crime of raping children.  The signal in question — carry on regardless — was given to all paedophiles in or out of the priesthood.  It is shocking that the archdiocese took out insurance in 1987, such was the extent of its knowledge of child sexual abuse in the church and the potential financial cost of it.  The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_666">The taking out of insurance was an act proving knowledge of child sexual abuse as a potential major cost to the Archdiocese and is inconsistent with the view that Archdiocesan officials were still 'on a learning curve' at a much later date, or were lacking in an appreciation of the phenomenon of clerical child sex abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Like the Ryan report, this report must prompt the Government to act urgently to protect vulnerable children today.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The recent closure of the special care facility at Ballydowd raises major concern over child services in this State.  This centre, which had been in existence for nine years, having cost €13 million to put in place, had to be closed because of its unsuitability for the troubled children who were held there.  It is extremely worrying that the HSE presided over a facility that, as HIQA has said, did not have enough staff to run consistently and safely.  How could this have been allowed to go on?  The HIQA national children in care inspection report, which included a report on Ballydowd, is a severe indictment of the State's failure to protect children.  It highlights serious deficits in standards aimed at safeguarding vulnerable children, including lapses in vetting procedures for staff and foster carers working with children.  My party spokesperson on children, Deputy Ó Caoláin, and others have repeatedly raised these issues in questions to the Minister for Health and Children and at the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">We also have the scandal of children going missing from State care.  A recent report from the Ombudsman for Children revealed that 454 children went missing from State care between 2000 and 2008.  The children in question are foreign nationals who are in Ireland without a guardian.  In many cases, they were not reported missing to the Garda.  Of the nine hostels inspected in the report, just two were registered and seven were found to be unsuitable, unsafe and unclean.  Children in some hostels were left overnight with little or no adult supervision.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, who has direct responsibility, must explain in detail how, yet again, children have been let down in this way by the State.  They must act with urgency to bring the care of vulnerable children up to standard or else we will have more Ryan and Murphy reports in years to come, only this time they will cover the present era.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The woefully inadequate state of our child protection services has been repeatedly exposed.  There are insufficient numbers of social workers and other front-line workers and not enough support systems in place.  The HSE knows of cases where children are in grave danger but services are not in place to make the interventions required.  Sadly, the nightmare of child abuse is not a thing of the past.  It happens every day.  Most of this abuse takes place in the family home.  If the necessary services are not in place the State today will be just as culpable as it was in the past when it conspired with the church to cover up the abuse of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">A whole range of measures must be taken in the light of the Murphy report but also in light of the Ryan, Ferns and Monageer reports and the recent HIQA report I mentioned.  These measures include the updating of legislation and clarification of the role of the HSE with regard to protection of child from abuse; a<b> </b>full 24-hour on-call social work service for vulnerable children and families; and the delivery of the promised referendum to strengthen children’s rights in the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The State must address the need for truth and justice and recompense those abused in institutions, both residential and non-residential, not covered by the Ryan report, including Finglas Children's Centre, Scoil Ard Mhuire in Lusk, Trinity House, Trudder House and Madonna House, as well as the Magdalen laundries and institutions established after 1970.  There must be a commission of investigation or other form of credible inquiry to investigate all matters relating to the conduct of Michael Shine in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  There must be implementation of the Ombudsman for Children's call for a child death review mechanism, in light of the deaths of at least 20 children in State care during the past decade, deaths which are now the subject of an internal HSE inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">We have heard calls for the resignation of those bishops found culpable in the Murphy report.  I support those calls.  However, much more important is the need to reform the way our education system is managed.  These bishops and others are so-called patrons of schools which are funded by the State.  Many parents nowadays have their children baptised primarily to ensure that they can get into primary schools in their locality where Catholic church baptismal certificates are required.  This is a disgrace in this age and in this State and highlights the need to complete the separation of church and State, especially in education.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The State pays for education through capitation grants, teachers' salaries and other funding but the vast majority of primary and secondary schools are not under democratic control.  They are predominantly under the patronage of Catholic bishops and in the ownership of the Catholic church.  This is a legacy of the era of Catholic church power and control that allowed the abuse highlighted in this harrowing report to happen.  We must move to a democratically controlled education system that is truly representative of the community and respectful of the rights of people of all religions and none, a system that is truly totally child-centred.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">I return to some aspects of the report.  The report is available publicly but it is a pity we do not have the opportunity to transfer the full report into the record to show the world the full extent of the disgraceful carry-on that happened in this city.  I do not refer to the actions of the perpetrators because words fail me with regard to the abuse, pervertedness and shame they brought on their church but to the failure of the State authorities and the bosses of the paedophile priests, the bishops and archbishops to protect children.  Children are supposed to be key to the Catholic church and this State but the institutions of the State and the church let them down at every turn.  This is a report about Dublin.  What about the reports to come from other dioceses?  That must be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">When we dealt with the Morris report into Garda corruption in County Donegal, I stated that a report into the abuse of power by the Garda Síochána was needed, not only in County Donegal but in other Garda divisions.  The same situation is replicated here.  I believe the systematic abuse of children by paedophile priests did not confine itself to Ferns, to these institutions or to Dublin but happened in every diocese.  That fact can be reflected when people read this report and remember the priests who were moved out of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">In the minute remaining to me, I shall deal briefly with the section on the Garda.  The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_678">There were a number of inappropriate contacts between the Gardaí and the Archdiocese.  Clearly the handing over of the Fr Edmondus case to Archbishop McQuaid by Commissioner Costigan was totally inappropriate.  The relationship between some senior Gardaí and some priests and bishops was also inappropriate — in particular, in the Fr Carney and Fr [blank] — cases.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_679">A number of very senior members of the Gardaí, including the Commissioner in 1960, clearly regarded priests as being outside their remit.  There are some examples of Gardaí actually reporting complaints to the Archdiocese instead of investigating them.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">These gardaí were supposed to be officers of this State but they clearly and totally failed their duties in that regard.  If any of them are still alive we must ensure they are charged with that and perhaps stripped of any pension or other rights that went with that period.  They failed absolutely the children in their care.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">I do not have enough time to continue but I thank Ms Justice Yvonne Murphy for this detailed report.  It is harrowing but should be read by anyone who is involved in child services in any shape or form.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_682">I already spoke publicly of the anger and revulsion with which I read the commission's report.  There is no doubt that these and other emotions are shared by all members of this House.  However, anger and revulsion do not beget justice.  In recent days we have seen an understandable drive for some gesture,  word or act to express our collective disgust and feelings of collective failure that Irish children, our neighbours, friends and families suffered silently amongst us, as we went about our daily lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">However, we must remain focused and clear-headed.  The painful fact is that there is no possible single act of purgation with which we can turn the clock back and wholly erase these failures or heal the pain.  What is possible and meaningful is to ensure that the guilty are punished, that our criminal justice system acts without fear or favour and that those evil men who raped and assaulted children in this State face justice meted out by the State and its people.  This justice must be blind to position, power or clerical rank and know innocence or guilt only as defined by the people and as set down by their Oireachtas in the laws of the Republic of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">I can assure the House today that it is clear from my contacts with the Garda Commissioner that neither he nor his force will rest until everything possible is done to make sure the perpetrators of this awful abuse pay for their crimes.  Those who have not yet been brought to justice for these crimes should spend every day of the rest of their lives realising there is no hiding place for them and that justice, even where it may have been delayed, will not be denied.  As the report makes clear, a number of the perpetrators have already been brought to justice, proceedings are pending against others and a number of investigations are ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">It was because a number of cases are the subject of proceedings that it was necessary for me, in accordance with the provision of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, to make an application to the High Court for directions as to the publication of parts of this report.  The House will be aware that, in the circumstances, Mr. Justice Gilligan ordered certain redactions.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">When the report was published, I said there must be people with some memory or fact that could help bring the perpetrators to justice.  I appealed for those people to come forward.  Of course none of us would blame people for wanting to put the dreadful brutality they suffered in their childhoods behind them.  The report is a testament to the courage of many victims of abuse who did come forward and, irrespective of how painful it was for them, told their stories to the commission.  While I realise what I am asking is not easy, I emphasise that anyone who comes forward will have what he or she says investigated fully and will be treated with great sensitivity.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Any information, particularly new information, can make a difference.  I am told by the Garda that the special contact line it set up after the Ryan report was published has resulted in about 60 cases being actively investigated.  Many of those cases will result in files being forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">It may be helpful for Members to place on the record of the House the special contact arrangements that the Garda has made following the publication last Thursday of the commission's report.  The special telephone number is (01) 6663066.  People can write to the office of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services, Harcourt Square, Dublin 2, marking their envelopes "Dublin Archdiocese Report".</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Beyond the question of dealing with individual perpetrators of sexual abuse, there is the wider question of criminal liability for the way abuse allegations were handled.  The Garda Commissioner has appointed Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney to examine specifically the findings of the report relating to the handling of complaints and investigations by both church and State authorities.  The Assistant Commissioner has been tasked with carrying out such investigations and inquiries as he deems appropriate and to make a report to the Commissioner with his recommendations.  The Garda Commissioner will then consult the Director of Public Prosecutions as to what issues arise in the context of criminal liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">It would be a disservice to the victims to pretend that pursuing criminal liability in regard to the handling of the cases of abuse is straightforward.  At times, some actions are profoundly morally wrong but not of themselves criminal acts.  The law as it stands — particularly the offence of endangerment in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 — is stronger than it used to be but cannot be applied retrospectively.  The standards of proof involved in a criminal trial are, quite rightly, high.  Many of the difficulties involved are identified in the commission's report.  However, the victims are entitled to expect that the issue of criminal liability on the part of anyone in authority in the church or State in the handling of these cases will be pursued fully and rigorously.  That is exactly what will happen.  Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney and his team will have the full investigative powers of the Garda Síochána in carrying out this examination.  They will pursue their inquiries, without fear or favour, wherever they lead.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">The commission's report finds that, in some cases, An Garda Síochána did not appropriately pursue allegations made known to it.  My profound regret that this should have been the case is shared by the Garda Commissioner, who has apologised for those failings, as has the Government, without reservation or equivocation.  In the half dozen or so instances where Garda handling of cases is criticised in the report, a common theme is that deference to the church brought about circumstances in which individual gardaí treated members of the church as if they were beyond the reach of the law.  Perhaps in the times in question, gardaí were not unique in showing such deference.  However, it is not, and never has been, acceptable for institutions to behave as if above the law of the State, or for them to be treated as such.  This is a republic with a sovereign people and no institution, agency or church can be immune from that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">In fairness to members of An Garda Síochána, it is only right to point out that the commission makes no criticism of current arrangement for investigating allegations.  Reflecting the comments of victims, the commission is quite complimentary about the current arrangements.  It points out that, even in former times, a number of gardaí pursued these cases without fear or favour.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">I pay tribute to the professionalism and sensitivity of individual members of An Garda Síochána, as reflected in the commission's positive remarks.  There are, however, no grounds for complacency.  Both the Garda Commissioner and I accept that, in this constantly evolving area of law enforcement, it is necessary to review our approaches continuously to ensure that the highest standards and best international practice are adhered to.  It is against that background, and having consulted the Commissioner, that I have asked the Garda inspectorate to review arrangements for Garda handling of complaints of sexual abuse against children.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I do not believe anyone for one moment doubts the commitment of the Garda Commissioner and his force to pursue allegations of the kind in question with determination and professionalism.  It is worth noting that the accountability arrangements for An Garda Síochána have been transformed and modernised by the Garda Síochána Act 2005 from the arrangements that were in place during the period covered by the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">I pay tribute to the commission for the valuable work it has done.  I welcome the fact that there was agreement on all sides to discuss the report here today.  There are hard and bitter lessons to be learned from the report.  As legislators and public representatives, we cannot flinch from the heart of darkness at its core.  All sides of this House are determined to do all they can to consign those evil days to a past which must be accounted for.

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_696">Sadly, for most of the past 90 years, we have lived in a <i>de facto </i>theocracy in which elected public representatives and senior public servants sought to enforce the agenda of the main church with secondary regard for the people of this republic.  Deference and subservience to church authority appeared to be the order of the day, in spite of the fact that our Constitution purported to vest sovereignty in the people alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The Murphy report confirms that State authorities, including the Garda, facilitated the cover-up of child abuse by members of the clergy by failing to fulfil their responsibility to ensure that the law was applied equally to all. <i>  </i>The report states senior members of the Garda regarded priests as outside their remit, with some members reporting complaints to the archdiocese instead of investigating them in any coherent and proper way.  It reveals that senior gardaí had inappropriate dealings with bishops, breached their duties and allowed one priest suspected of sexual abuse to leave the country without bringing criminal charges.  The report infers that there was one law for the clergy and another for the people.  The inference of the perversion of the course of justice is clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">What happens next in our courts, as legislators, will confirm whether this culture has truly changed in practice or whether public servants, be they politicians, civil servants or public servants such as gardaí, will continue to allow their personal religious beliefs to supersede law of the land, with devastating consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">This week, the Garda Commissioner announced he has ordered an investigation into the findings of the Murphy report.  It is vital that this investigation be more than just a paper exercise.  We need to see prosecutions.  If it takes an Act of the Oireachtas to overcome difficulties impeding prosecutions, we must enact it.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">The very existence of the Murphy report affirms that we have made some <i> </i>progress in putting the good of the people ahead of the good of the institution of the Catholic church; however, there is no shortage of evidence that an unbalanced church-State relationship persists in this jurisdiction.  A clear example of the inappropriate championing of church interests by the State is the indemnity deal agreed by the then Minister for Education and Science, the Secretary General of his Department and representatives of the religious orders regarding child sexual abuse and the setting up of the redress board.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The indemnity deal is a glaring example, but more subtle examples exist.  It has emerged that there may be difficulties in prosecuting senior clerics and gardaí for their involvement in the cover-up of child sex abuse in the Dublin archdiocese.  Legal experts have pointed to the failure of a previous Garda investigation to mount a case against church officials for failing to report serious crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The investigation prompted by the 2002 "Prime Time" documentary on clerical child sex abuse sought evidence to support charges of misprision of a felony.  Ms Justice Murphy states in her report "In all the circumstances, it is considered by the commission that the misprision of felony investigations were carried out more for the sake of completeness than from any substantial belief that there would ever be such a prosecution".</p>
          <p eId="para_703">She further notes that difficulties have arisen due to the abolition of the distinction between a felony and a misdemeanour in 1997.  The comments of Judge Murphy suggest that the previous Garda investigation was little more than an exercise in paper writing, perhaps borne out of a desire to soothe an enraged public rather than bring criminals to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">There is a gap in the Statute Book which impedes the criminal prosecution of State officials and clergy who covered up child abuse which should be addressed.  We have heard references to amending the 1998 Offences Against the State Act which should happen as a prerequisite to dealing with the broader issues involved.  As a House, we were able to change the statute of limitations to facilitate prosecutions for child abuse.  Surely there is something we can do now to deliver justice to victims of child sex abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">It is abundantly clear that many politicians and senior public servants continue to have blind obedience to the Catholic Church with their fidelity to the State coming a poor second.  What is also clear is the contempt in which the Church holds secular State authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">We now know that the Murphy commission wrote to the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2006 seeking information on reports of clerical sex abuse sent to it by the Dublin archdiocese over the relevant 30-year period.  It also sought information on the document Crimen Sollicitationis which deals with clerical sex abuse.  It did not receive a reply.  Instead, the Vatican contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs complaining that the commission had not used appropriate diplomatic channels.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">A year later the commission wrote to the papal nuncio in Dublin requesting that he forward all relevant documents that had not been or were not produced by Archbishop Martin.  The papal nuncio was also asked to confirm if he was in possession of relevant documents.  He simply ignored the commission and continued to ignore it when earlier this year it sent him extracts for its draft document which referred to him and his office.  Dr. Leanza, the current papal nuncio, has cited diplomatic protocol as the reason he and the Vatican authorities ignored a State appointed commission headed by a judge of this jurisdiction.  This contemptuous response can only be taken to be a tangible example of the contempt in which the Vatican continues to hold the secular authorities of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">It is worth noting that in June 2001 Pope Benedict, the then Cardinal Ratzinger, wrote to every diocesan bishop instructing them to refer complaints of clerical child sex abuse to Rome in the first instance so that the Vatican could decide how such complaints would be dealt with.  Therefore, we know that the present pope is a keen advocate, or was at the time, of the view that Vatican authority is superior to State authority in a country like Ireland where State law takes precedence.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">Since the publication of the Murphy report we have heard apologies from senior clergy in Ireland but what action have we seen?  We have been warned, as recently as today, not to seek "a head on a plate".  In effect, that is another way of asking for an exemption from accountability.  The dialogue may have changed in Ireland but has the culture changed?</p>
          <p eId="para_710">There is little proof that the Catholic Church truly believes that civil law is superior to Canon Law and while senior figures such as politicians and public servants continue to be members of secret Catholic organisations, the State will always come second best and civil law will always be undermined.  What is the legacy of putting Vatican interests ahead of the interests of the people of Ireland?  We know it is abuse and oppression.  The Murphy report says it all.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">As an elected public representative, it does not matter one whit to me which bishops resign, and where and when it happens.  That is a matter for them and the church.  However, there are civil consequences which are important.  Where bishops and priests are church patrons of hospitals and schools, and are members of their boards, they should be subject to civil consequences for their actions.  It is time to shake off the legacy of subservience.  It is time for the State to assert itself.  It is now abundantly clear that morality is not merely a religious concept.  Our State laws, in effect, are moral.  In theory they are superior to canon law and the wishes of the senior clergy, but we must ensure at all times that they are also superior in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">I compliment Judge Murphy and the commission.  However, the best tribute we can give to the judge and her team is to act on the report to ensure there will not be a repetition of what is contained in the 700 pages of the Murphy commission report.</p>

          <p eId="para_713">The Ryan report and the Murphy commission have set out a litany of abuse, evil, crimes and omissions which have caused and will cause Ireland to have to rewrite its social and political history.  In that sense, they have done a great service to our country and society in terms of knowing the facts.  I share with my colleagues on both sides of the House an abhorrence and disgust at the crimes and crimes of omission outlined in the report.  They have been well ventilated by my colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">While the impact does not diminish with repetition, I refer to one issue in the short time which is available to me this evening before the debate resumes on Thursday.  It is a matter to which the Taoiseach referred in his comments.  Yesterday I met the new assistant national director of the HSE with responsibility for children and family services to discuss the progress and scope of the HSE's audit of child protection practices within Catholic diocese and religious orders.  The audit, as currently designed, will be finalised by 22 December 2009 in respect of the dioceses.  It is hoped that the audit of religious orders may also be completed by that date.  A number of dioceses have asked to re-submit their questionnaire responses and the requests have been assented to, which will of necessity entail a delay in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The returns have been submitted and child care managers who have undertaken the task of engaging with the dioceses are finalising their work which involves face-to-face interviews with each diocese.  The assistant national director to which I referred, who was commended by Judge Yvonne Murphy for the way in which he carried out his previous role as director of child protection in the Archdiocese of Dublin, has suggested that to verify the data provided, additional information will be required from the HSE in respect of each diocese.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">He has recommended that, in addition to the statistical information already supplied, the HSE's child care managers should request from the relevant ordinary, that is, the diocesan bishops and provincials of each religious order, the names of the complainant and the person against whom the complaint was made in respect of each allegation referenced in the audit return, the name and location of where the matter was reported to the HSE and the Garda Síochána and the date the report was made.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The child care manager will then arrange that each file is checked internally in the HSE to ensure the matter has been dealt with appropriately by the State and each diocese in question.  A member of the national children and family social services team in the HSE will then liaise with the Garda Síochána to ensure receipt of all the allegations, as referenced in the audit.  The collation of this additional information will, according the assistant national director, allow the HSE to submit to me a more detailed and comprehensive report.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">I fully agree with this proposal and notified my support for this approach to the HSE this morning.  It will write to each bishop requesting the additional information.  The national audit has been criticised as a statistical exercise which is of little, if any, use.  However, it should be remembered that the need for such an audit arose out of the recommendations in the Ferns Report.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_734">In the April budget, the Minister for Finance announced that child benefit would be means-tested or taxed in the following budget — all he needed to do was to work out how to do it.  Eight months on, he still has not managed to do that.  Rather than accepting that he cannot achieve savings the way he intended to do, he is still intent on achieving them anyway.  Some Ministers apparently favour a straight cut across the board while others favour a three-band system.  The only certain thing is that the Government is intent on targeting families and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">The motion before us tonight calls on the Government not to cut child benefit in the forthcoming budget for a number of reasons.  Cuts in child benefit are not acceptable because family incomes have already been significantly cut in the past two budgets.  There should also be no cut in child benefit because of the continuing high cost of raising children, including the cost of child care; because there is no recognition in the tax system; because of the damaging effects such cuts would have on the economy; and because any of the proposed reforms would create poverty traps, create work disincentives and increase the risk of child poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">Child benefit is a payment made to parents, usually the mother, in recognition of the significant extra costs in rearing children particularly in households with young children.  It arose originally as compensation for and recognition of the high costs associated with rearing large families.  In more recent years, it has developed as one of the most important social policy instruments because it provides protection against child poverty, but does not create poverty traps in doing so.  It provides income support for children regardless of their parents' means, marital status or work status.  It provides a financial buffer for parents who leave the workforce in order to care for their children.  In the case of parents who remain in the workforce, it contributes to the extremely high cost of child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">It is precisely because it is such a key instrument of social policy, and precisely because it seeks to achieve so much, that child benefit is a relatively generous payment.  It is a payment greatly valued by women, often long after the payment ceases, because it recognises the role that women play as mothers and carers.  For many women, it is the only direct payment they receive.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">It is not good enough for the Government to claim that just because the bill for child benefit has now reached €2.5 billion, it must be cut.  We must consider what child benefit is achieving and how cuts would adversely impact on thousands of families.  Child benefit needs to be relatively generous because there is no recognition of children in the welfare or tax systems, and because there is a complete lack of State-supported services for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">In my constituency, as in many others, it costs €65 to bring a child to the doctor.  Child care costs more than €1,000 per month for five days a week and more than €700 for three days a week.  While the cost of living has come down generally in the past 12 months, these two costs that impinge heavily on parents, child care and doctor visits, have remained at the same level and in some cases have increased.  In other countries, parents can rely on affordable access to a doctor, good early childhood education, public child care and a range of options for older children.  Child benefit here essentially compensates parents for a lack of investment in those critical services for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Families with children also tend to have big mortgages.  Large numbers of families are already struggling to fund these mortgages even with reduced interest rates because of job losses, reduced hours or pay cuts.  It seems that the Cabinet has forgotten that families have already borne the brunt of severe cuts.  The April budget shamelessly targeted families.  It reduced mortgage interest relief; halved the early childcare supplement and will abolish it from January.  As a result of that budget, parents of young children will lose several thousand euro a year — as well as taking pay cuts and increases in levies along with all other workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">Child benefit has already been cut for 18 year olds, a decision which will lead to a much higher rate of young people dropping out of school and college.  There is no attention in Government and little in the media given to the cumulative effect of the past two budgets' cuts on family incomes.  By my calculations, a single-income couple with two children on an income of €40,000 — not especially well off — lost €250 per month from the decisions taken in the April budget.  This will increase to €330 per month from January when the full effects of that budget take effect.  This means that such a family will already have €80 less per week to spend before any changes in next week's budget.  This is on top of the several dozen cuts, charges, taxes — and for public service workers, pension levies — introduced since the October 2008 budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">Since April, a welfare dependent family has lost €125 per month so far and this will rise in January.  Since April, a double-income family on €70,000 has lost €330 per month so far and this too will rise from January.  There are only so many times the Government can go back to the well.  One public sector worker contacted me yesterday expressing his dread at the prospect of the coming budget because along with the cuts he and his family have already suffered, the Government has indicated he will need to take a cut in pay and most likely a cut in child benefit next week.  That man is dreading next week's budget because as it is he can barely survive.  He can barely sustain the kinds of cuts he has suffered in the past two budgets and any further cuts to his family income will simply be unbearable for that family.  That situation is mirrored thousands of times over throughout the country.  The bottom line is that child benefit has become an integral part of the family household budget.  Parents depend on it to provide for their children and cutting it will cause hardship in a great many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Let us consider what the experts have said about the Government urging that child benefit should be cut.  The ESRI, the McCarthy report, the Commission on Taxation and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs in conjunction with her departmental officials have all considered reforming child benefit but none of them has come up with a practical and fair way of achieving savings.  The ESRI could not work out how to tax child benefit without major legal and bureaucratic problems so it simply opted to recommend a 20% across the board cut.  That is simply not good enough.  It is obvious that a 20% cut places a far bigger burden to those on low incomes than those with greater means.  There is no fairness in that and in terms of child poverty such a cut across the board could reverse much of the progress in tackling child poverty in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The McCarthy report was even worse.  As the Tánaiste admitted, there is no social policy in the McCarthy report.  With equal disregard for its effects, it too advised a 20% cut across the board and the standardisation of rates without regard for their potential impact.  Anyone could do that.  It was silent on how this could be done in a workable way and where costs would not make it counterproductive.  It was a similar story with the Commission on Taxation, which recommended the taxing of child benefit but could not outline exactly how it would work.  Its report stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_745">Child benefit should be taxable income.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_746">The taxing of child benefit should be benchmarked against alternatives, including means testing, to ascertain the most effective method of achieving the aims and objectives of the child benefit programme.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_747">If taxation is applied, we recommend the introduction of a child tax credit to offset the additional tax payable in respect of child benefit for those in the lower half of the income scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">All of these approaches are intellectually lazy and disregard the available evidence on the effect of across-the-board cuts on child poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">In fairness to the Minister, her Department considered the issue in more detail.  On "The Frontline" a few weeks ago, the Minister suggested the Government might favour a three-banded approach with no cuts for those on welfare or family income supplement, some cuts for those on low and middle incomes and larger cuts for those on higher incomes.  I have no problem in principle with lower income families receiving more in child support than families with very high incomes.  However, wanting this and actually achieving it are two different things.  First, the biggest advantage of the universal entitlement is that it creates no disincentive to work and no poverty trap.  As soon as it is means tested, it will become a poverty trap.  The concentration of child benefit on lower income groups would stigmatise the payment and create major anomalies for any parent going from welfare to work.  The welfare system is already riddled with poverty traps such as the rent and mortgage supplements and the rules concerning the back to education allowance and the back to work enterprise allowance.  We do not need more anomalies.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">In addition, such a change would be an administrative nightmare.  Already this year the Revenue Commissioners have struggled to handle the changes in mortgage interest relief and income levy.  The Government has no idea how much extra it will cost to assess entitlement.  It does not have enough staff to ensure jobseekers' applications are processed in time, so how on earth will it manage even more work?  The Minister's proposal that high earners declare themselves as such is laughable.  The wealthy have never declared their income for tax purposes, so why does the Minister expect them to change their ways now?</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Relying on the family income supplement is fraught with difficulties.  FIS continues to suffer from chronically low take-up rates.  Only 25,000 families are currently in receipt of payments.  In addition, it excludes the self-employed and workers with intermittent work patterns, and does not factor in costs such as child care and mortgage repayments.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">It is disappointing that there are other revenue raising options available to the Government but it refuses to consider them.  The Government has a duty to find savings where it can.  The Labour Party accepts that adjustments worth €4 billion are required this year.  However, the Government must also pursue policies that will have the least impact on the economy and on jobs.  Cutting back on child benefit is one of the most deflationary things possible.  It will lead to further job losses in crèches and in the retail sector.  It will take hundreds of millions of euro out of the domestic economy at a time when it needs a stimulus.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">The State spends about €2 billion a year on unnecessary tax subsidies.  About €600 million goes on relief on rental income for landlords, €400 million on property reliefs, and several hundred million on various forms of pension relief for the very wealthy.  It is incredible that the Government can so easily overlook these areas when formulating a budget for 2010, especially as cutting back on these is likely to be far less deflationary than cutting child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">If the Minister is really interested in ensuring that child benefit does not go disproportionately to the better off, the fairest and most practical way to make savings is not to have three bands of child benefit but to have three bands of income tax.  Various reports suggest the Government is seeking to save more than €300 million by cutting back on child benefit.  The Government could raise just as much money by increasing income tax on the balance of single incomes that exceed €100,000.  This would avoid targeting families and exclude low and middle income groups.  The Revenue Commissioners estimate that such a tax would yield €355 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">I cannot understand the Government's approach on this.  Why is it so afraid of taxing the better off and yet so intent on cutting child benefit?  In a few minutes the Minister will stand up and tell us she does not have any choice in the matter and that savings must be made from the social welfare budget.  However, this is not the case.  The reason the social welfare bill is so high is not that welfare is too generous but that there has been such an increase in unemployment.  The obvious way to reduce the social welfare bill is to get people back to work and safeguard jobs.  The Government has utterly failed to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The public, while understanding the need for a difficult budget, will simply not tolerate the Government's taking the easy option of cutting social welfare while refusing to cut corporate welfare.  Fairness demands that cuts must start at the top.  Responsibility demands that the Government tackle the budgetary situation on that basis and that some element of consensus be achieved.  If the combined efforts and collective intellectual weight of the ESRI, an bord snip nua, the Commission on Taxation and the Department of Social and Family Affairs cannot come up with a workable — not to mind fair — way of cutting the child benefit bill, the Minister herself is unlikely to be able to do that in the next seven days.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The Labour Party suggests the establishment of three rates of tax rather than three rates of child benefit.  This would avoid creating new poverty traps; it would not hit families; it would target the better off in obtaining savings; it would have public support; and it would achieve greater savings for the Exchequer.  I ask the Minister to engage in an honest debate on this issue and give us her views on the Labour Party proposals.  I challenge her to tell us why she is not prepared to target the better off but is intent on targeting children and families.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_758">The Irish tax code is a funny thing.  It can recognise, and has recognised, Pino Harris and his yacht <i>Christina O</i>.  It recognises stallions at stud.  It also recognises high-achieving sportsmen, heritage properties, writers and artists.  However, it does not recognise children, the cost of raising a child and the burden that places on the incomes of parents who are taxpayers.  That is why child benefit is supposed to be a universal payment, paid to the caring parent — usually the mother.  It is this way because the tax code contains no recognition of children.  A person or couple who work and have a child pay the same amount of tax as an individual or couple with no dependent children.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Many years ago, at her inauguration as President, Mary Robinson spoke of mná na hÉireann.  Child benefit is, has been and will continue for a long time to be mainly an issue for mná na hÉireann and their children.  That is why it is so vulnerable.  Since 1944 when Seán Lemass introduced the children's allowance, every time there has been an economic crisis one of the suggested solutions has been to tax or means-test the payment.  This goes in cycles.  It disappears when the economy is going well and comes back as a critical debating point when the economy is in crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">Given that it is so valued by women and their children, in a way I have been quite touched by the number of young fathers, particularly in the ranks of Fianna Fáil, who have stood up and stated manfully that they do not need child benefit.  It is always open to them to return it to the State.  Male journalists and male economists have similarly suggested, because they are middle class and relatively well-off in salary terms, that they are not convinced they need child benefit.  I would like to hear the views of the mothers of their children on child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">When the early childhood supplement was abolished earlier this year, many parents accepted the decision, knowing it had been introduced by former Taoiseach Deputy Bertie Ahern as a payment in the run-up to the last general election and that it was a bribe which drove up child care costs in every crèche and child care service in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Child benefit is keeping many families afloat.  We all know many of the hundreds of thousands of young families where the dad worked in construction among the legions of chippies, sparks and brickies, all of whom did well and worked terribly hard during the boom.  Mr. David McWilliams described them as breakfast-roll man and they voted in large numbers for the Minister's party.  Most of them have two children and a reasonably large mortgage and now they have little or no work.  Child benefit is keeping bread on the table.  It is paying the food bills of a significant number of families who have had a massive reduction in their income.  Often the grandparents are helping to pay the mortgage to keep the wolf from the door, put food on the table and keep the house from being repossessed.  That is true of so many families in so many parts of the country to which I have spoken recently and it constitutes a kind of stimulus in the current extraordinarily difficult economic conditions for so many families.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">The Minister's proposals, those of the various groups to which my colleague, Deputy Shortall, referred, involve either means testing or taxing child benefit.  These date back to 1944.  I received a report on that as Minister of State at the then Department of Social Welfare in 1995.  It is like a wheel, where the same suggestion comes up over and over again.  Those horses — means testing and taxation — will not gallop.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">This is important to our future.  The critical problem with means testing or taxing child benefit is that it would constitute another significant poverty and unemployment trap.  People who are surviving on the margins make economic decisions as to what maximises the money in the house for them and their children, and what puts the food on the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">If the Minister wants to reform child benefit, then she should integrate the tax and social welfare systems.  That is the action to take.  We have never had refundable child tax credits even though we now have tax credits throughout the system.  I recognise that they are technically extraordinarily difficult to implement, but they are implementable and they have been implemented in other countries.  This does not work well for the reasons about which Deputy Shortall spoke.  Much of FIS is used for low-paid employees in public service jobs, for example, in hospitals.  Many private employers will not touch FIS because there is too much bureaucracy involved and they prefer to throw an employee a few bob under the counter.  That is the reality, as the Minister will hear if she goes out to speak to small firms about FIS and the bureaucracy involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Child dependant allowance is a poverty trap.  People argue for it in easpa an mhalairt.  Everybody knows that if a person gets stuck on social welfare, child dependant allowances, rent supplement, etc., he or she would need to earn €500 to €600 a week net, or €700 gross taking account of tax, PRSI, getting to work, etc., in employment in order not to be out of pocket.  If the Minister goes down this road, she will create more poverty and unemployment traps.  What we do not want building up in the economy is the disaster we saw in the 1980s that lasted right up to approximately 1995 where one found on going into local authority estates, whether in the Minister's constituency or mine, large numbers of people on the dole because they did not have much of a paying alternative.  The Minister is proposing to make poverty and unemployment traps worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">In terms of work incentives, the advantage of the child benefit system is that, whatever the family and whatever the parent, if one wants to go out to work or if one wants to stay at home with one's children, child benefit is not impacted on.  If the Minister decides to means test or tax child benefit, where next year many of these families with two children and a large mortgage will have one income only and individualisation will come back to bite the Government badly, it will make economic sense for many couples simply to separate and for one parent to become reliant for a long period on the State.  Doing that will give families an economic incentive to part rather than the Government providing an incentive for children to be raised and nurtured in a family of two parents, which is probably best for most children.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">If the Minister continues in this way, many couples who might otherwise get married will not take the plunge because they will lose too much in social welfare benefits if they enter into a committed long-term relationship.  At present, if a woman on lone parent's allowance goes to live with somebody who is working, she may lose her housing benefit and her lone parent's allowance.  She will become the dependant of the person who is working.  In that situation, particularly if one adds in rent allowance, such a family could lose more than €300 a week.  If the Minister proceeds to tax or means test child benefit, that situation will become worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">In this country, child benefit is society's contribution to the rearing of the next generation.  In almost all Scandinavian countries child benefit is a universal payment.  In fact, there are many other benefits for children worked into the welfare codes of those countries.  In many ways, those are the countries which we ought to aspire to be like.  Those are countries where there is a high quality of provision of services for children, including preschool.  Rather than a race to the bottom as regards children's welfare, we should try to model ourselves on best practice throughout the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">In looking at the forthcoming budget the Minister, along with her colleagues, has the difficult task of finding approximately €4 billion.  There is general agreement to find approximately €1 billion of that in savings in public sector pay.  We know that about another €1 billion will probably result as savings in the capital programme.  We are also aware that there are a number of efficiencies and savings available from the McCarthy report that are not particularly contentious and which would probably yield €600 million or €700 million.  In the revised programme for Government, the Government seems to have agreed to a carbon tax, which will yield somewhere around €500 million.  That leaves a gap.  The Labour Party's suggestion, as set forward by Deputy Shortall, is that the gap could be bridged by reducing thresholds for various tax reliefs embedded in our system, some of which relate to property.  Those property tax reliefs currently amount to about €435 million per year.  The Minister's colleagues are probably asking her to offer up something like €300 million plus in child benefit.  That seems to be the suggestion in the media, even though the ESRI has suggested a larger figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Property-based tax reliefs are what helped our economic bubble to burst.  The Government should consider passing on them because they are basically a dead-weight in the system.  Similarly, pension benefits for some very high earners are essentially a form of tax-saving and investment strategy, rather than savings for pensions and retirement.  We will have plenty of suggestions as to where the Minister can find an alternative to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">It should be remembered that child benefit is spent in this country — on children's shoes, food and school books.  It is probably one of the best stimuli.  I strongly recommend the motion moved by my colleague Deputy Shortall.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_237">
          <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_773">Deputy Burton referred to the history of child benefit and I wish to provide some more details on that.  In 1943, it was a progressive move by the then Minister, Seán Lemass, to introduce a Bill to provide for a universal allowance for the third and subsequent children in a family.  The Labour Party supported the introduction of child benefit at that time.  Almost 70 years later, the legislation is still in place and we have built on it.  For all the cynicism about politics, that was a time when worthwhile measures were taken in this House.  The allowance was introduced to provide support for large families with three or more children.  Lemass's argument for bringing in the payment was that wages did not relate to family size because a person might earn the same amount irrespective of whether he had a family.  In addition, there was nothing in the tax system that recognised the extra cost of raising children.  Lemass argued for a universal payment that would not be means tested.  That was because the Government of the day wanted to ensure there was not the slightest suggestion of charity being associated with the allowance.  In the 1943 debate, Lemass said a means test would involve an inquisition into the affairs of families, which is often resented and as a general rule is undesirable.  He was frank in his speech to the Dáil, stating that the consequences of introducing a children's allowance would be the need for taxpayers, irrespective of whether they had children, to pay more.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Lemass also referred to models in other countries, including the 1942 Beveridge report which proposed Britain's welfare state, including the national health service.  Such progressive moves were also being made in other countries, including those undertaken by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt to cope with the Depression.  Those were hard times, including the Second World War and food rationing, which also affected this country.  At the time, there were progressive proposals on how societies should work together to deal with the important issues of the day.  One such step taken by the Dáil at that time was the introduction of a payment which was about valuing children.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">The reasons for having child benefit today, which is not means tested, are the same as obtained in 1943.  We value children and believe they have unique rights.  Children are not allowed to work, as we believe they should be protected during their upbringing and should also have the opportunity to avail of education.  Children have no income, so the allowance was a payment for children then, as now.  Parents still receive the same wages irrespective of whether they have children, and this is the State's way of providing an income for children.  If we get rid of universal child benefit we will be taking away money from the children we are supposed to protect.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">Other countries have adopted the principle of universal child payments similar to ours.  In 2006, a report on the cost of raising children in North European countries noted that seven such states had universal, non means-tested child benefit payments to parents.  They were Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Germany and the United Kingdom.  It is notable that the Scandinavian countries have much more universality in their social provisions than we have in Ireland.  We have some such universality, but it is limited.  Most of our social welfare payments are means tested.  The economies of countries that are doing best in terms of equality are better than ours.  They have more infrastructure and better provision of public services.  They have more universality and equality than Ireland.  Rather than rolling back on the promise we made in introducing the principle of universality concerning child benefit, we should try to introduce more universality, for example, in the health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">We should preserve the universality we already have.  These hard times are not a reason to roll back on progress concerning universality.  The countries that introduced such universal provisions did so just after the Second World War in financially straitened times.  In Britain, where so much housing had been destroyed, they introduced a national health service based on the principle of universality.  That is the direction in which we should be heading, rather than using our economic recession as an excuse to roll back on the progress we made in 1943.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">A generous philosophy underpins the principle of universality.  Seán Lemass demonstrated a generous political impulse in deciding to introduce a universal children's allowance.  The measure is about social solidarity and working together on what we value as a society.  We have universality in education but not in health, which is a dysfunctional system.  Our education system is a good one, which provides for all our children.  It is not perfect but it has helped society to make great progress.  We also had universality for medical cards, but the Government demonstrated a begrudging attitude in going after the over-70s' medical cards, particularly given the small savings that were made as a result.  Similarly, when people talk about withdrawing universal child benefit, it displays an ungenerous political motivation.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The 1916 Proclamation referred to cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  The signatories of the Proclamation valued children's unique rights.  Their concept was that we should cherish and protect them.  In many respects Ireland does not have a good record on children's rights.  That is all coming out now, with the Ryan report and the report by the Commission of Investigation into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin as well as the fact that we have stalled <i> </i>in doing anything about children’s rights in the Constitution.  Many other countries provide for children’s rights in their constitution, and it is not a big deal.  We should get on with it and provide children’s rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">To vindicate these rights, we need to work together to protect, value and cherish <i> </i>our children.  Rather than begrudging children this payment, we should build on it, maintain universality and do more to vindicate their rights in our society.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_783">"recognising:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_784">the importance of the child benefit payment to all families with children, and particularly those on low incomes;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_785">that, since 2000, the monthly rates of payment for child benefit has increased from just €53.96 for the first child and €71.11 for the third and subsequent children to €166 and €203 respectively;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_786">that overall expenditure on child benefit grew from just €638 million in 2000 to €2.5 billion in 2009;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_787">that the rate of consistent poverty among children, as measured by the EU survey on income and living conditions, has almost halved since 2003 — from 12.2% to 6.3%;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_788">that funding under the 2 child care programmes, namely the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme and the National Childcare Investment Programme, is expected to create some 65,000 child care places, the majority of which are already in place;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_789">that 98,000 places will be available next year under the new free pre-school scheme;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_790">that given the scale of the current economic crisis, failure to stabilise the public finances would lead to increased borrowing and jeopardise Ireland's ability to fund vital social services in future years; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_791">that, in that context, it is appropriate to examine the €2.5 billion being spent on child benefit and consider how savings might be made in this area; calls on the Government to consider the various options around child benefit and their implications for the needs of families with children, particularly those families on lower incomes, in the context of the forthcoming budget."</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The forthcoming budget is being framed at a very difficult time for Irish families.  As Minister at the Department of Social and Family Affairs, I am very conscious of the needs of the 412,407 people who were on the live register at the end of October 2009.  I fully understand that a wide range of other groups — such as people with disabilities, carers and pensioners — depend on the welfare budget for vital support.  I appreciate the importance of child benefit to all families with children, but particularly those on low incomes.  I assure the House that this Government has done and will continue to do the very best that it can to protect the most vulnerable people in Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">Over the past decade there have been significant increases in welfare payments.  The State contributory pension has increased from €113 to more than €230 per week.  The weekly rate of jobseeker's allowance has been raised from €93 to €204 per week and the carer's allowance has been increased from €89.54 to €220.50 per week.  We have provided increases in welfare rates that were far in excess of increases in both prices and wages.  Since 2000, the rates of child benefit have increased from just €53.96 for the first child and €71.11 for the third and subsequent children to €166 and €203, respectively.  In fairness, Deputy Shortall in her opening speech, acknowledged that these were relatively generous payments.  In the same period, overall expenditure on child benefit has grown from just €638 million to approximately €2.5 billion.  As a result, approximately 12% of gross social welfare spending in 2009 will go on child benefit.  It is not true, as Deputy Burton has said, that child benefit only gets looked at in bad times.  Child benefit was significantly increased in the good times.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">Currently almost 600,000 households receive child benefit in respect of 1.1 million children.  Deputy Tuffy's contribution, where she outlined the reasons child benefit was introduced in the first instance in the 1940s, highlighted the fact that it was provided for third and subsequent children for large families as an anti-poverty measure.  Poorer families were, and are today, more likely to have more children.  As she quite rightly quoted, it was introduced in the first instance, not as charity, but to support such families and ensure it was an anti-poverty measure.  Subsequently, it was to become available to all children and all families.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">A family with four children now receives €738 per month, or €8,856 per year, in child benefit, regardless of how high the parents' earnings from employment are.  As Deputies will be aware, in addition to child benefit, families dependent on basic social welfare payments may also receive an extra payment for each of the dependent children, through the qualified child increase, QCI.  The current QCI rate of payment is €26 per child per week — up from €21.60 per child in 2006.  More than €530 million is expected to be spent this year on QCI payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">To ease the transition from welfare into work, people who have been in receipt of a jobseeker's payment, with a full-rate QCI for at least 12 months, can generally keep that increase for 13 weeks if they take up work that is expected to last at least four weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">While this, and other transition arrangements, can help people move back into employment, the family income supplement, FIS, was designed to provide ongoing financial support to low-income working families.  Expenditure on this scheme has also increased dramatically in recent years.  In 2000, just €39.4 million was spent on this scheme.  By 2008, it had grown to €181 million and this year more than €200 million is being provided for FIS.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">Between 2000-08, we significantly increased the income thresholds for FIS so that more families would qualify for it.  For example, for a family with four children the income threshold increased from €372 per week in 2000 to €760 a week in 2008.  As a result, the number of families benefiting from the scheme grew dramatically — from just 13,000 in the year 2000 to over 28,000 families last year.  In the 2009 budget the FIS threshold were increased further to enable more families to qualify for it.  To see how this works, take a family with one parent working full-time and the other working 19 hours a week — both on the minimum wage.  Their gross income from employment would be €510.35 per week, leaving them with a net income after the income levy of €505.25.  If they have four children, the improvements we have made mean they would now be entitled to a FIS payment of €176.85 per week, as a  top-up to their wages, giving them a combined income from employment and FIS of €682.10.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">If only one parent in the same family was working, and he or she was in full-time employment at the minimum wage, the gross income from employment would be €346 per week and their additional income from FIS would be €272.40 per week.  The combined income from employment and FIS would therefore be €618.40.  In both scenarios they would also be entitled to child benefit of more than €170 per week.  That shows a real commitment to supporting not just people on social welfare.  Conscious of the fact that there can be a poverty trap, we also support those low-income families through FIS.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">Major improvements have also been made in recent years in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  In 2000 the rate for 2-11 year olds was just €80 per annum, while €99 was paid for children aged over 12.  This year, the payment rate is €200 for 2-11 year olds and €305 for those aged over 12, recognising that this is a particularly expensive time of year for families.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">These improvements in child benefit, qualified child increases, the family income supplement and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance have had an enormously positive impact on the lives of Irish children and their families.  The most recent EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions in Ireland published by the CSO last week indicated that the rate of consistent poverty for children had almost halved from 12.2% in 2003 to 6.3% in 2008.  Other developments over the 2003-08 period, such as the increases in employment rates that preceded the current downturn, improvements in the minimum wage, and increases in basic welfare rates, also contributed to this decrease in poverty rates.  However, there is no doubt that increases in child-related income support payments played a major important role in lifting so many children, and their families, out of poverty.  The Government has pursued — and will continue to pursue — a comprehensive approach to tackling poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Even throughout the economic difficulties of the past two years, the Government has done its best to prioritise social welfare.  The October 2008 budget provided for increases of between 3% and 3.8% in the basic payment rates at a time when inflation for 2009 was expected to be 2.5%.  In reality, prices have dropped considerably this year.  By September 2009, prices — as measured by the consumer price index — had fallen by 6.5% and are now forecast to drop by an average of between 4% and 5% for the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">While child benefit payment rates were not increased this year, a package of improvements in other child income support and family payments was put in place from January 2009, at a cost of €56 million.  These included: an increase of €2 in the qualified child increases payable with social welfare payments bringing the rate up to €26 per week; an increase of €10 per week per child in all family income supplement income thresholds, giving an increase of up to €6 per child per week; and an increase of €50 per week in the income threshold for the back to school clothing and footwear scheme to enable more families to qualify for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">In framing the April supplementary budget, very tough decisions had to be made across the whole range of Government expenditure.  In that context, the provision of €21.3 billion for social welfare services in 2009 — 20% more than the amount spent in 2008 — was a clear demonstration of our commitment to protecting the most vulnerable people in society.  Tax rates and borrowing had to be increased to fund this extra expenditure on social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Deputies will be aware that the Government expects to have to borrow €26 billion this year.  It also estimates that 16% of all tax revenue next year will go on servicing the national debt, compared to 8.5% in 2009 and just 3.5% in 2007.  This means that €16 out of every €100 that each person pays in tax next year must be spent on repaying loan interest instead of being used to fund social services directly.  Clearly, the more money we borrow over the next few years, the more interest we will be obliged to repay in the future and the higher the proportion of people's hard-earned wages that must be spent on servicing the national debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The Government wishes to avoid an unsustainable increase in the national debt that could hamper Ireland's social progress for a generation.  That is the reason it is determined to reduce spending, and consequently borrowing, by €4 billion next year.  In framing next month's budget, the Government faces difficult choices.  While it is aware it must reduce expenditure by €4 billion in 2010, it also is aware there is no easy or pain-free way of so doing.  Deputy Shortall stated that the Labour Party acknowledges the €4 billion must be found.  However, in addition to income, expenditure must be tackled also.  Social welfare spending makes up the largest single block of Exchequer gross current voted expenditure, accounting for 37% of the total, at slightly more than €21 billion this year.  Public pay and pensions, at €19.8 billion, accounts for 35%, while other programme expenditure, not including pay, at €15.8 billion, accounts for the remaining 28%.  The scale of the savings required from public expenditure as a whole means that some reductions must be made in the social welfare area.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">I appreciate that it will be hard for people to cope with any decrease in welfare spending.  However, unless the Government takes steps now to reduce overall public expenditure and restore stability to the public finances, it risks making the economic situation far worse for everyone, including welfare recipients, in the long term.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_809">In that context, much as though the Government would prefer to avoid so doing, it is appropriate to consider the €2.5 billion being spent this year on child benefit.  As I noted earlier, the rate of child benefit paid to all families has increased dramatically in recent years.  In 2000, parents received €53.96 per month for each of their first and second children.  Today, they get €166 per child every month.  In 2000, the rate paid for each of the third and subsequent children was €71.11 per child per month, while the current rate is €203 per month.  In the same period, overall expenditure on child benefit has grown to more than €2.5 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The Government is proud to have been able to deliver such significant increases in payments to families when the resources were available.  It also is proud that, as a result, child income support for parents in Ireland now is far higher than in many other European countries.  However, in the current economic environment, it simply cannot afford to keep spending at the same level as it did when its tax revenue was much higher.  In its recent report on the Irish economy, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, acknowledged that while the amount of resources spent on social protection had been comparatively small in Ireland in the past, there has been a significant increase in the generosity of welfare provision over the last decade.  The OECD singled out the fact that child benefit had increased by a factor of almost four since 1997 and noted that Irish child benefit and other social welfare benefits are now high by international comparisons, particularly with respect to the United Kingdom.  More generally, the OECD suggested that the universal payment of benefits which are not related to household income should be reconsidered.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">In considering how changes might be made to child benefit, the Government is conscious that different families rely on this payment for different reasons.  Families reliant on basic welfare payments such as the jobseeker's allowance or those on low wages are likely to use their child benefit to help put food on the table or to put shoes on their children's feet.  Families on middle incomes with large mortgages may rely on their child benefit to meet relatively basic needs.  For many women, child benefit supports them working outside the home by providing a significant contribution towards their child care costs.  In addition, for some women in high-income households, child benefit may be the only income that is paid directly to them.  The Government appreciates, therefore, that child benefit can be an important source of income for all families for different reasons and its deliberations on the future of the payment are being informed by this understanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Members will be aware that the Commission on Taxation recommended in principle that the child benefit payment should be taxed, while the McCarthy group recommended an across-the-board cut in child benefit payment rates.  However, the Government's deliberations on the welfare budget are not simply being informed by analysis and proposals from the aforementioned groups alone.  They also are being influenced by the understanding each Cabinet member has, both as a Minister and as a constituency Deputy, of the real difficulties facing families at present.  As Minister for Social and Family Affairs, I have met a wide variety of groups recently to listen to their views about the forthcoming budget.  As part of these discussions, I have listened to the views of groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Children's Rights Alliance, as well as CORI and Social Justice Ireland in respect of child benefit.  The views of these and other groups have informed my Department's consideration of potential changes in this area.  Obviously, Members must wait until the budget to ascertain what the Government's final decision will be.  I can assure the House, however, that in considering all the options, the Government is determined to find the fairest way of achieving savings, while protecting those on low incomes as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">The motion before the House tonight also specifically refers to child care.  This has been an issue on which the Government has been increasingly proactive in recent years.  Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010, funding has been approved which will result in the creation of approximately 65,000 new child care places.  The evidence available to the Government is that previous shortfalls in centre-based child care now have been met despite a large increase in demand due to rising numbers of women at work and immigration.  A survey released by the National Children's Nurseries Association last year suggested that the average fee for full-time day care had fallen slightly since 2007.  Current indications available to the Office of the Minister for Children suggest that fees have fallen further this year, as one would expect at a time of deflation.  When combined with the reductions in fees for children supported by the community child care subvention scheme and the benefit of the new free preschool year, child care costs are falling for parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, who will speak in this debate tomorrow, leads me to understand that the preschool sector now believes that any further significant creation of places will cause oversupply.  As a result, the emphasis has shifted from capital funding for additional places to current funding with a view to improving the quality and accessibility of existing provision.  While the early childcare supplement will be abolished from 1 January 2010, it will be replaced with a free preschool year in early childhood care and education, ECCE.  This scheme has been widely welcomed by child care experts as a positive step in targeting support in a way that will directly support the child.  Under the new ECCE scheme, services in the community and commercial child care sectors will provide a free preschool year to children in the year prior to junior infants, in return for a weekly capitation of €64.50 over 38 weeks.  There will be five sessions of three hours' duration each week and services will be required to meet the standards set out in Síolta and Aistear.  Síolta will have a co-ordinating role and the county child care committees will support the providers in meeting these standards.  In cases in which a child attends full day care in a crèche, the Government will pay €48.50 weekly over 50 weeks in return for a 2 hour and 15 minute session each day, with a consequential €48.50 reduction in the child care fees charged of the parents.  I am delighted the Government made the decision to introduce this new scheme.  It will give equal opportunities to all children, particularly the most marginalised who would not otherwise be able to avail of preschool services.  I believe the long-term benefits will be enormously significant to all our children and to society as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">This new initiative represents an annual investment of €170 million in the provision of free preschool services and clearly demonstrates that, despite the current difficult economic environment, the Government is determined to maintain its commitment to the further development of early education and child care nationwide.</p>

          <p eId="para_817">This investment is in addition to the substantial funding provided under the community child care subvention scheme, which ensures access at reduced rates to quality child care for disadvantaged and low-income families.  Arrangements are well advanced.  When the scheme was announced, some Deputies on the Opposition benches claimed the sector would not be in a position to supply the required number of places.  However, with a month to go, approximately 98,000 places are being offered by applicants, which is well in excess of the requirements.  Some Opposition Members also argued against the scheme being free and argued that commercial preschools should be allowed charge fees from parents in addition to the capitation received from the Government, thereby limiting the benefits of the scheme to those who could afford to pay those fees.  I am glad to note the Government held firm on this issue and the scheme will be widely available to children of all backgrounds, making the benefits of quality preschool accessible for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">I also was pleased the Government was able to introduce a higher capitation fee of €75 under the scheme for higher quality preschools with more highly qualified staff.  These services also will be available to children regardless of parental means and this will incentivise the sector into further up-skilling of its workforce.  Further good news was available to the sessional preschools, representing 65% of participating services, when the Valuation Office announced ECCE-funded sessional services would be exempt from local authority rates from January as a result of being wholly or mainly funded by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The Government has directed huge resources at both child and family income supports and at child care provision.  Since 2000, it has increased the rate of child benefit to €166 for the first and second children and €203 for the third and each subsequent child per month.  Overall expenditure on child benefit has increased to more than €2.5 billion.  Income thresholds have been improved for the family income supplement with an increase in the number of families benefitting from the allowance.  Extra moneys have gone to qualified child increases to ensure welfare dependent families and those benefitting from family income supplement get more to support their children.  The Government has created tens of thousands of extra child care places and will introduce a free preschool year for all children.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Taken together, it is evident from these initiatives that the priority the Government has given to children has been unprecedented.  The halving of consistent child poverty between 2003 and 2008 is a clear testament to the fact that its policies have delivered major improvements for low-income families in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">Child benefit is paid to all families, not just to those on low incomes.  We appreciate it is important to all mothers and to different families for different reasons.  The Government has carefully considered all the issues around child benefit carefully which will be reflected in our budget announcement.</p>

        <speech by="#MJNolan" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Deputy M. J. Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_822">I do not envy the Minister in the challenges which she and her Government colleagues face trying to frame the budget.  It must be acknowledged that since the introduction of child benefit over 65 years ago there have been significant changes in its payment regime.  Initially introduced in 1944 for a third and subsequent children, today child benefit, as it known, is paid for all children.  The Minister is correct in reviewing the benefit, not just because of the budgetary situation the country faces but for calls for an overall review.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">For many families, the household budget is framed around the salaries of the parents.  Child benefit payment day also marks a significant date in the household monthly budget, particularly those which are restricted or on a low income.  Mothers have always earmarked the payment for particular expenditure items, be it for children's clothes and footwear, school uniforms and books, and it is seen as an important part of their income stream.  I hope this remains so.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">However, I was particularly struck by the Minister's comment that for a family of four children, the payment of child benefit represents €738 per month or €8,856 per year.  For a family in the high-income bracket and paying the higher income tax rate, this would represent an annual salary of between €17,000 and €18,000 in order to get a net payment of €8,800 per year.  This must be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">One area not referred to in the debate so far is the abuse of claims.  We hear anecdotally, particularly from constituents, of abuses in claims for child benefit, particularly in respect of those from Europe and overseas.  They came to Ireland during the good times of the boom and were entitled to claim child benefit for their children in their home countries.  Following the downturn in our economy, these individuals have returned home.  Claims are made that they return to Ireland on a regular basis to keep their record to claim child benefit.  I understand 7,000 EU nationals currently claim child benefit for 11,000 children living outside of the State.  It might be worthwhile in this economic climate to examine that area of expenditure.  It costs approximately €20 million a year for the State to pay child benefit for 11,000 children outside the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The April budget provided for €21.3 billion in social welfare payments for 2009, representing a 20% increase on the 2008 level.  While much of that increase may be attributed to the significant increase in unemployment, there have been increases across all social welfare payments.  This is put into context when one considers the State will borrow €26 billion this year, effectively 95% of social welfare expenditure.  This is unsustainable.  Changes have to be made and child benefit will be one of these areas.  Some time ago, the Minister referred to a three-tier level of payment which could be examined.  I am pleased to note the Government's decision will be informed by various interest groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other voluntary organisations which have a particular interest in lower paid workers and low-income families.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">The ESRI and the McCarthy report suggested a 20% cut to the benefit, which is a bit clumsy, while the Commission on Taxation recommended it should be taxed.  All of these can be taken into the mix but I believe each individual family must be examined.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs has streamlined its means test process.  If PPS numbers can be tied in, there should be enough information in the Department to have an effective means test for social welfare payments without going to any more expense.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Many families are feeling the effects of pay cuts and job losses.  This will bring the payment of child benefit to them more into focus.  It is a challenge we have to face.  The budget, currently being drawn up by the Government, will not be easy with no area of expenditure escaping.  The tax generation side has been exhausted.  From the increases in taxation introduced in the past year, we have seen a fall-off in the revenue stream.  There will have to be changes in expenditure and I will support the Government on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">The Government's amendment to the Private Members' motion states, "given the scale of the current economic crisis, failure to stabilise the public finances would lead to increased borrowing and jeopardise Ireland's ability to fund vital social services in future years".  This must be recognised if we are to protect social welfare payments and be positive in our commitment to the less well-off.  The Government will protect the country's finances to achieve this.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I accept the Labour Party's motion is well-intended and I see its merits.  Knowing the individual Ministers in the Government I am confident that whatever decision is taken will be in the best interests of the country, and therefore, in the best interests of families.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_833">I thank Deputy Shortall and the Members of the Labour Party for tabling the motion, which we, in the Fine Gael Party, support.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">As a parent of a young family and from talking with many of my friends and constituents, I know the huge pressures that are currently being placed on families.  Many of the additional pressures now being placed on parents is due to the financial difficulties in which they find themselves, as a result of the Government's mismanagement of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Child benefit has become a vital payment for every child in this country, a payment that many women rely on to help pay for child care, repay loans, meet ESB and gas bills, help out with the interest payments on mortgages, save for expensive occasions such as Christmas, holy communion, confirmation and children going back to school.  That is the reality for hundreds of thousands of families throughout the country, not just those in the lower income brackets.  Child benefit is a necessity, not a luxury, for thousands of households either in mortgage arrears, making rent payments, or trying to cope with large levels of personal debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">Why should we penalise children living in households with a significant taxable income but with large debt levels and little or no disposable income?  The suggestion that a graduated system of child benefit payments would be made to mothers based on the household taxable income fails to take into consideration the levels of indebtedness in family households.  The Government has done little to support struggling families who have suffered from the downturn and are experiencing difficulty repaying their mortgages and household.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">A means-tested child benefit system would create further financial barriers for many people who want to get off social welfare and back to work.  There are more than enough anomalies without creating yet another incentive to give up work and move on to social welfare.  Earlier speakers referred to unemployment traps.  The McCarthy report, currently the Government's bible, highlights the issue of unemployment traps.  It is important that the rates and benefits available under the social welfare system do not inhibit a return to work.  For those of working age there are increasing indications that the level of welfare payments is creating disincentive effects for improved labour participation.  An example is given of a Dublin-based couple with three children, aged four, eight and 11, who avail of benefits to the value of €23,000.  With the addition of rent supplement the benefits could rise to approximately €35,500 per annum plus an additional €6,500 in child benefit payments.  That would increase the gap that exists between people on social welfare and those who are willing to go to work by another €6,500, which would impose a further disincentive to people getting out of the social welfare system and back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">Even greater anomalies exist within the tax system.  We have a taxation policy that gives greater recognition to bins than it does to babies.  Fianna Fáil has developed a crazy tax system that recognises the cost of paying for refuse collection, but ignores the costs associated with raising children.  Ireland is one of the few developed countries in the world that fails to give any recognition to children within the taxation system.  Child benefit payments are therefore the only support provided to families to assist them with the raising of children.  To add insult to injury, the Government intends to use the tax system to graduate the payment of child benefit, and to deprive families of those essential payments, but it is still not prepared to recognise costs such child care and the day to day costs of rearing children.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">I welcome the Taoiseach's indication recently that pension payments will not be cut.  Given that Fianna Fáil is largely to blame for the current economic mess, it is clearly wrong for the most vulnerable sections of society to pay the price by having their entitlements slashed.  However, Fianna Fáil seems determined to undermine another section of society in need of State support, namely, children.  The Government is showing every sign of slashing child benefit in the next budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">I remind the Taoiseach that he stated recently that budgets were not simply about balancing books, important as that is.  The Taoiseach said a budget was also about "acknowledging what we all see as important in society".  Does that mean that the Taoiseach and his Government think more of refuse bins than they do of our children?  Deputy Kenny has categorically stated that Fine Gael is committed to leaving child benefit untouched as thousands of hard-pressed families have come to depend on that direct payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">More than any other party, Fine Gael understands the need to make savings in the forthcoming budget.  It was the Government's irresponsible squandering of taxpayers' money during the boom that got the country into this mess in the first place.  However, there are other ways to make savings than to slash child benefit.  Fine Gael's budget approach is to stimulate job creation to get the country back on its feet and to target savings away from front-line services in order to protect both the young and the old in society.  Child benefit is no luxury, it is an essential part of household income.  Fine Gael will do all it can to ensure that children are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">We have long argued that the best way to reduce the social welfare budget is to get people back to work.  Sadly, the Government has already accepted the fact that it intends to allow a further 72,000 people join the dole queues next year.  Fine Gael, on the other hand, has a radical plan to transform the economy, make it competitive again and get people back to work.  Our proposals, as set out the New Era plan would create 105,000 jobs.  Getting that number of people back to work would save the Exchequer €2,100 million in a year.  Not only that, but New Era would transform the economy by investing €18 billion over four years to make our broadband network among the top five in the world, turn us in to a net energy exporter by 2030 with 50% of our energy coming from renewable energy sources by 2020 and overhaul our water networks and infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">That comes on the back of plans to maintain 80,000 existing jobs in the small and medium enterprise sector.  Fine Gael has outlined 18 different measures to support that plan, along with PRSI changes to support the employers of 1.7 million workers in the economy.  There is not a man, woman or child in this country who is not aware of the depth of the challenges facing us.  They are bigger than any one individual but the right policies can be used to tackle the issues head-on and provide us with what we need most, namely, jobs.  There are ways of making savings in budgets if the Government has the will and the courage to deliver them.  They require real reform and determination to succeed.  Simply hitting front-line services or taking money off the most vulnerable in society with no plan to get people back to work is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">The Government has proposed to either tax or means-test child benefit, which would involve huge administrative costs.  The Revenue Commissioners are already struggling to cope with the changes to mortgage interest relief. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is struggling to cope with the processing of unemployment claims.  The Revenue Commissioners who collect the taxes do not have the information on children to link it to the tax system while the Department of Social and Family Affairs does not have the detailed information on the taxation status of children's families to deal with the issue through child benefit.  We are talking about creating an administrative nightmare that will cost as much as it will save.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">The Government claims that its plans to cut child benefit are essential to making the savings it requires, but nobody should expect children to shoulder the blame for the Government's mistakes.  Targeting the nation's children for savings is patently wrong and unfair.  There are other ways of making savings in the social welfare budget, including measures such as eliminating fraudulent claims and by changes in Government spending, which would not represent a direct attack on one of the few payments made directly to parents for their children.  Our children will play a vital role in Ireland's economic recovery.  It would therefore be foolish, not to mention unfair, to penalise the very people on whom we will depend in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Fine Gael is committed to not changing the child benefit payment, a payment on which thousands of hard-pressed families depend.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_847">I strongly support the Labour Party motion proposed by Deputy Shortall.  I hope it will be supported and given consideration for implementation in the budget next week.  As Deputy Naughten said, Fine Gael's position on child benefit has been clear for some time, that it should not be touched in the forthcoming budget.  We recognise that savings must be made but we have outlined and will outline ways in which they can be made without interfering with child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">I listened to the Minister's contribution and I support her in terms of the sensitivities and so forth that she will bring to this issue.  However, the big issue for the people in my constituency is the fear of thousands of families in this country in which people have lost their jobs, are unable to keep up with mortgage payments or are working three day weeks.  These people are suffering.  As we approach next Wednesday the main fear for the old age pensioner is what will happen to the pension, while for families with children it is what will happen to child benefit.  The safety cushion of the Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients has been taken away.  They now fear the child benefit will also be taken away.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The parents of thousands of children will continue to do without themselves in these tough times but the single message they do not want to give their children is that they cannot provide them with the necessities, not the luxuries, of life.  These could be clothing, Christmas presents or a pair of football boots a child needs to go to their local club for coaching.  These are necessities for people, the things that are needed to prevent the creation of a greater divide in our society.  All Members have heard the pre-budget submissions of various groups and organisation over the last few weeks.  We have heard that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is at breaking point due to the increased demands on the society.  Most of those demands come from families with children, who cannot cope with the all the difficulties they face.  If the society is unable to cope at present, how will it cope if child benefit is interfered with in next week's budget?  It will be a step too far.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">A number of groups in our society cannot speak up for themselves and need protection.  Perhaps the Government holds the same view.  The elderly would be considered one of them, although they certainly spoke up for themselves last year and made the Government change its mind about removing the medical card from the over 70s.  Another group is people with disabilities and another is children.  With regard to the elderly, the Taoiseach has already guaranteed that the pension will not be interfered with.</p>

There have been booms and recessions many times in this country's history and child benefit has survived all of them.

If the Minister interferes with it in next week in the budget, she will reintroduce poverty to thousands of families.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">Every Member of the House recognises that the people of this country are angry and afraid.

          <p eId="para_855">The Minister has had much experience over the years with the matter I wish to discuss briefly, the historical significance of child benefit.  I tend to call it children's allowance but that is because I have been around a great deal longer than others.  I will take the historical point of view on this, even if some people might accuse me of being discriminatory.  Of all the payments that have been made through social welfare or, indeed, from any other source, none has been as significant or beneficial as child benefit.  The reason is that it was invariably paid to the mothers of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">In my experience, before there was a Celtic tiger economy and even since then, child benefit for many women is the only payment they can call their own.  There are many women in this country, and they are not all in the lower income groups, who experience meanness on the part of their spouses, and in my experience there are many mean men.  As a result, every month a huge number of women at every level is society have nothing else to count on aside from child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">If a value for money audit of child benefit was carried out, I believe it would show that it gives the best value for any money paid by the State.  It goes specifically to children, irrespective of their economic circumstances.  Whatever else the Minister does next week, she must not interfere with child benefit.  It would be a shocking thing to do.  Even though they will not say it openly, I have made the case for people who, unfortunately for them, are tied into a situation whereby, irrespective of what income comes into the household, all they can claim as their own is child benefit.  It should not be cut off.  Is my time up?</p>

          <p eId="para_860">At the request of the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, I recently met the committee to brief it on final preparations for the 15th conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the fifth meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol, which will take place in Copenhagen from 7 to 18 December.  The Copenhagen conference is rightly one of the most widely anticipated peace-time world events.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to make this statement in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Ireland fully supports the EU's leadership role in the international climate change process under the UN convention.  The position of the EU and Ireland is based on the global scientific consensus on the potential impact of climate change.  The advice of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, reflects that consensus.  It emphasises the enormity of the threat we face and the urgency of a comprehensive and effective global response.  EU policy on what constitutes a comprehensive and effective global response to climate change is reflected in the substantial body of conclusions that the Council has adopted over a number of years, most recently at its meeting last month.  They set out a clear and strong EU mandate for the Copenhagen conference based on the fundamental objective of keeping the increase in average global temperature to within 2° Celsius of pre-industrial levels to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">The EU recognises the process established under the UN convention as the appropriate forum through which to develop and implement an effective global response to the threat of climate change.  The ultimate objective of the convention is clear — greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere must be stabilised at a safe level.  The 2° Celsius goal adopted by the EU responds to this objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The scientific advice from the IPCC is also clear on the need for early and effective action.  A significant milestone towards achieving that objective is the absolute priority for the conference.  Action is not just an option, particularly when we reflect on the plight of people in developing countries who are living on the "climate front line".</p>
          <p eId="para_864">At the end of the penultimate round of the international negotiations in advance of COP 15, the EU restated its firm commitment to reaching a comprehensive, fair and legally binding treaty in Copenhagen.  To be effective, the treaty must cover all countries and reflect a level of ambition consistent with the objective of keeping the increase in global temperature below 2° Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels.  More specifically, the successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol must respond to the four key elements of the Bali action plan, namely, mitigation, adaptation, technology transfer and finance.  It must also provide a clear and strong context for action in the form of an over-arching long-term goal, a shared vision that responds to the 2° Celsius objective by aiming to ensure that global emissions peak by 2020 at the latest, reduce by at least 50% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels and continue on a downward trend thereafter.

          <p eId="para_866">I would hope so.  I believe the usher has them.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">In the international negotiations, questions have been raised recently about the EU's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, suggesting that the EU is somehow trying to walk away from it.  I want to assure the House that nothing could be further from reality.  The EU has always been and remains firmly committed to the Kyoto Protocol, its structure and its objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">To be clear on the issue, the EU preference for the post-2012 commitment period is a single legally binding instrument under the convention and would enhance implementation and ensure consistency in the application of the post-2012 international climate regime.  In other words, a new protocol that builds on the Kyoto Protocol and incorporates its fundamental structure, particularly its provisions on key issues such as legally binding quantified emission reduction commitments for all developed countries, robust reporting, monitoring and compliance requirements, flexible mechanisms and requirements on land use, land use change and forestry.  In summary, the EU objective is to broaden the scope and effectiveness of the international response to climate change in the post-2012 period without compromising on the principles or structure of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">A clear case for broadening the scope and effectiveness of the international climate change regime is the need to address ecosystem emissions.  While attention to date has focused on fossil fuel emissions, greenhouse gases from ecosystems, including agriculture, natural forests, plantations and wetlands, are a major contribution to the problem.  In addition, the potential for these ecosystems to absorb carbon is an essential element of an integrated response to climate change.  The Kyoto Protocol addresses some of these carbon emissions and sinks, but not all of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The worst potential consequences of a policy framework that addresses fossil fuels but mostly does not address ecosystem emissions are increased pressure on these natural ecosystems.  We have seen an example of how this would work in the destruction of peatland rain forests to facilitate the production of palm oil.  We must ensure that the new agreement does not create any such perverse incentives.  The scope of the successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol must cover all aspects of ecosystem emissions, including all forests and soil carbon associated with forest management, cropland and grazing land management, wetlands and deforestation.   In seeking to influence an ambitious new global agreement, the EU has already provided a clear signal on a mid-term goal.  It has adopted a 20% greenhouse gas emission reduction target by 2020 compared with 1990 and has committed to step up to a 30% target subject to two conditions, namely, that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable reductions and that developing countries contribute adequately according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">However, this level of global action by 2020 might not be enough.  Since publication of the intergovernmental panel's fourth assessment report in 2007, scientific studies have suggested quite consistently that the warming process is happening more rapidly than anticipated and that the emission reductions proposed in the 2007 report may be insufficient.  A consensus is emerging among leading climate scientists that we may need to not just reduce our emissions, but have net reductions in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.  They suggest a target level of 350 parts per million while current concentrations are over 380.  The next report from the intergovernmental panel is due in 2014 and a priority in the negotiations is to ensure that a new global agreement includes a review of targets and objectives by the end of 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">Turning to climate finance, the new treaty on climate change will not happen unless it includes a comprehensive financial package to assist developing countries in key areas such as capacity building, mitigation, adaptation, technology and protection of their forests.  Based on figures developed by the European Commission, the EU has strengthened the focus on finance in the international negotiations by setting out estimates of short-term and long-term needs.  The cost of mitigation and adaptation action in developing countries could amount to approximately €100 billion per annum by 2020.  The international public support element of that could be between €22 billion and €50 billion per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">While that is the longer-term position, beginning in 2013, there is a more immediate need for fast-start international public support for developing countries.  The Commission estimates that such support could cost between €5 billion and €7 billion per annum over the three-year period between 2010 and 2013.  The EU is committed to paying its fair share at international level.  Ireland is committed to paying its fair share of the EU contribution.  I wish to make it clear that I see the international climate change agenda and the millennium development goals as parallel priorities.  They are not competing priorities — any suggestion to that effect is entirely unacceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_875">There are people who believe that in view of the economic downturn, action on climate change should be deferred or given a lower priority in the shorter term.  Such views are misguided and damaging.  The Council is perfectly clear on this point within the EU.  I welcome and fully support the Council's decision to underline the opportunity and the need to build on the synergies between action on climate change and economic recovery.  I agree with its view on the need to seek a long-term financial and economic architecture that will integrate our approach to climate change with our goal of transition to a sustainable economy.  Such an economy is the only one that is compatible with the avoidance of dangerous climate change and the addressing of the inevitable impacts of existing concentrations of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">It has been widely reported in the media that a changed outlook for the Copenhagen conference has become evident.  It is clear that a new and fully fledged treaty is most unlikely to be achieved in Copenhagen.  Despite the clear commitment of all parties at the 13th conference in Bali in 2007 to finalise a new treaty in 2009, we have run out of time to complete that task in Copenhagen.  At best, it is possible that a politically binding agreement, rather than a legally binding treaty, will be reached.  That is disappointing.  It ignores the fact that we are quickly approaching the point at which the impact of climate change will become significantly more challenging and more costly to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">In response to this setback for the international process, the European Commission has said that the minimum outcome in Copenhagen must be a framework agreement on the essential building blocks of a new treaty and a deadline for completing it.  The agreement must include ambitious emission reduction commitments by developed countries, adequate action to curb emissions growth by developing countries and a financial deal to assist developing countries in mitigating their emissions and adapting to climate change.  My immediate reaction, in addition to disappointment, is that the framework agreement will have to be convincing in relation to the commitment of all parties and the timeframe for finalising the treaty will have to be short.  I welcome the announcement of pledges by a number of key players in the international negotiations, including Brazil, the US, Indonesia and China.  While this momentum in the process is encouraging, the pledges are inadequate.  President Barroso said on Sunday, in response to the sum of the pledges that have been made so far, that we are not yet where we should be if we want Copenhagen to succeed.  As I said at a meeting of the Oireachtas joint committee, I do not know what the outcome of the Copenhagen summit will be and I doubt that anyone knows.  I am happy to repeat in this House the assurance I gave the joint committee with certainty — the commitment and determination of the EU to achieving a new legally binding treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol is undiminished.  While the process may take a little longer than we would like, the objective is unchanged.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">I will speak briefly about national policy before I conclude.  I acknowledge and welcome the joint committee's recent report on climate change law.  The report represents a valuable input into the development of the forthcoming climate change Bill, the heads of which are being developed in my Department.  I welcome and take encouragement from the clear all-party support that exists for primary legislation on climate change.  It is an important prerequisite to the gaining of broader public acceptance and support for the legislation, when it is published in 2010.  The committee is to be congratulated on that breakthrough.  The legislation will provide a statutory framework for a core national priority, it will be ambitious in the application of legal obligations and responsibilities across all sectors and it will give legal clarity and certainty to the key underpinning principles that will guide and drive the cross-sectoral effort on transition towards a low-carbon future.  My Department has recently completed an initial consultative process with other key Departments and State agencies.  The next stage in the process will be the publication of a framework document in the coming days.  I stress that this stage of the process will not interfere with the development of the heads of the Bill, which I hope to complete in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">The transition to a low-carbon world economy will happen quickly.  We have two options — to move with it, or to be left behind.  There is no alternative to this transition.  We know it can be done.  It is technically feasible, economically affordable and eminently sensible.  It will present challenges and opportunities.  If we are to get our policy right, we must minimise the challenges and maximise the opportunities for people and for the environment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_258">
          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_880">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak during this debate.  It is unfortunate that it is taking place at this late stage in the evening, as it is unlikely to get any coverage.  We are likely to be talking to each other, rather than spreading an important message about climate change.  I would like to make a relatively brief comment about Copenhagen, before raising some signature issues that I believe the Minister and the Taoiseach, in particular, and the Government, in general, need to highlight as Ireland's key priorities.  I suggest that we have some credibility with respect to such issues.  I will also make some more general points about this country's domestic performance, the national targets we should be setting and the practical measures we can adopt in areas like transport, energy and agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">It is recognised that a comprehensive and legally binding new treaty is unlikely to emerge from next week's summit in Copenhagen.  While world leaders have been careful to reduce expectations over recent weeks, for good reason, it is disappointing nevertheless.  There have been some positive developments over the last ten days or so.  The US President, Mr. Obama, and the Chinese Premier have both made pledges and are planning to visit Copenhagen.  The Minister is right to say that pledges are not enough.  We know to our cost in this country that political pledges often do not mean much when circumstances change and other political priorities take over.  A new legally binding deal that is similar in structure to the Kyoto Agreement is required.  Such a deal should require developing countries to make a commitment to limit emissions increases.  In the case of Ireland and other developed countries, significant reductions in emissions are needed.  The Copenhagen target must be to finish with a very strong legal commitment on a process, a roadmap and a timescale for when the new legally binding treaty will be put in place.  People are already suggesting that it might be possible to achieve that at next year's summit in Mexico.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">I would like to repeat a point that I have made to the Minister on a number of occasions at meetings of the joint committee.  I had some experience of this when I was in the European Parliament.  When going to conferences such as this and getting involved in negotiations, as has been the case in Council meetings within the European Union, there is a tendency among small countries to become, essentially, observers or commentators when big deals are being put together.  It is very important that Ireland should decide what are the key signature or niche issues we wish to push as our agenda.  That should have happened before now, at Council meetings such as the one that occurred on 23 November and with regard to going to Copenhagen.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">In that way, Ireland would develop a reputation for an expertise in some key areas in which we have credibility and on which we can deliver by leading by example.  Targets are an example.  We had an opportunity to build our credibility with regard to delivering on promises.  At present our reputation is in tatters regarding the commitments we made under Kyoto.  To be fair to the present Minister, Deputy Gormley, he was not there when those commitments were made and he is a relative newcomer to his current portfolio.  However, even in his time the targets we set ourselves have been missed pathetically.  There is a series of reasons for that on which I do not wish to waste time.  We must concentrate now on building some credibility so that we can credibly say we will meet the new commitments we make.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">What might help that effort significantly would be to put in place what the Minister talked about and Deputy McManus put together as a framework document, namely, legally binding legislation on a national level for our climate change aspirations.  I shall mention a number of items that should be included.  We need to set targets for the medium term, 2020, and the longer term, 2050.  Those targets must be separate from but connected with our international obligations.  We need sectoral targets within different areas.  That is happening at present in a totally unco-ordinated way across Government with regard to emissions targets in different sectors, for example, transport, energy and environment.  There is no clear unambiguous target-setting going on in the different sectors at present but this should be happening.  It should happen by means of legislation and if the different Departments do not meet those targets there should be consequences.  The Minister will find support on this side of the House.  In big catch-all parties like mine, Fianna Fáil and, to a certain extent, the Labour Party, it is sometimes difficult to get agreement in areas such as agriculture, transport and so on but we will work with the Minister on this if he takes brave and responsible decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">Regarding the Bill, it is also very important to set up an independent commission.  Deputy McManus is very strong on this and I am sure she will talk about it presently.  It is important that there should be somebody separate from Government who would monitor the Minister's performance.  It should not be an Opposition party person nor should this be seen as playing politics.  It should be somebody who would help and have top expertise available to him or her to advise Government on what is appropriate and achievable concerning what will help an economy to grow but at the same time will reduce emissions.  That same body that would be independent of Government should be able to expose freely failures in meeting targets, performance benchmarks, and so on.  If necessary, Ministers need to be humbled and changed if they are not performing.  Many cynics talk about the impact of a potential new climate change Bill in Ireland and ask who will fine the Government if it does not perform.  We can structure this in a way that requires a political response, with significant consequences if those responses are not delivered upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">I have not yet fully decided on one matter but the Minister's Department must think about it, namely, whether to include the emissions trading sector in the new climate change Bill or whether the Minister should decide the Government no longer has responsibility for the traded sector because now it is a European project.  He may decide that because of emissions trading, the trading in carbon credits and the value of carbon that problem will sort itself out.  I am not convinced that is the case.  There is a growing case for including the traded sector within the targets to be made legally binding.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">It would be very helpful if the Minister were to look for genuine cross-party support towards the construction of the Bill at the early drafting stage.  He might be surprised by the constructive response he would get from Opposition parties if he were to do that.  That does not happen very often but on an issue like climate change, when we are setting targets for the next 40 or 50 years, parties would be willing to work in a constructive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">To return to Copenhagen, one of the areas in which we have credibility is development aid.  Whether in the European Parliament, the Commission or in development aid issues generally, Ireland has credibility.  We should focus on this single issue perhaps more than on any other.  It concerns the separation of the funding requirement from millennium goals and aid budgets which countries are putting together, collectively in the case of the European Union, and finance that is being set aside specifically for mitigation, adaptation, technology transfer and so on.  The Minister will see some sleight of hand here.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">I know the Minister is genuine about this issue but I would prefer if he  were to say, "I am speaking on behalf of Government when I say," rather than "I think we need to have two separate revenue streams here".  As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with responsibility for climate change, Deputy Gormley must speak on behalf of the Government, and perhaps he does, but he should say that more so that he is on the record.  He might drag the Cabinet in that direction too so that what is said becomes an absolute commitment, to which in two or three years' time, even if Ireland is still in the depths of recession, we will still be required to find an answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">It would be very easy to make the popular case that we need to merge adaptation measures in parts of the continent of Africa, especially in the case of development aid budgets because it is all about helping poor people, and so on.  We must nail down that issue.  I accept that the Minister is personally committed to it but that is not enough because he may not be here in six or eight months or in two years' time.  I want a Government commitment in writing to that so that there will be a commitment by the Taoiseach and Cabinet rather than by Deputy Gormley, as a Minister and an individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">The Minister might correct me if I am wrong but I found it disappointing he did not raise this issue on 23 November in the Council meeting, having said he would do so at a committee meeting in response to my questions.  I asked him specifically to try to get commitments on this issue because there has been a problem in getting commitments from certain European countries on this area, specifically on committing finance.  That is understandable because many economies are struggling at present.  Ireland needs to carve out niche issues so that people know what to expect when we come into the room.  They will know this is something on which we do not compromise and on which we want to push others.  That is how we will get things done.  If we try to be a jack of all trades, whether in the Council or at Copenhagen, we will not get anything specific done.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">I do not have much time left but I shall mention some practical measures that I would like the Minister's Department to consider.  I have a lot to say with regard to the budget so I shall try to distil it.  I mention forestry because the Minister also mentioned it.  In the climate change strategy to which the Minister signed up to we aspired to planting 15,000 hectares of trees per year.  In the Renewed Programme for Government, for which the Green Party is largely responsible, there is a commitment to planting 10,000 hectares per year.  In reality, we will be lucky to plant 5,000 hectares this year.  Forestry premiums are being reduced.  I spoke to industry representatives from both the private sector and Coillte and they are extremely concerned about the industry's capacity, on the basis of the current supports, to increase the planting level.  This must change and the Minister must achieve this as a member of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">Consider the commitments made by the United Kingdom in recent weeks to afforestation between now and 2050.  We have more planting space per head of population than in the United Kingdom and plenty of suitable land.  We need to put a financial structure in place in the budget to ensure the aspiration to plant 10,000 hectares per year will be realised.  I would like to see more hectares planted but the planting of 10,000 hectares next year would represent a good day's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">I will finish by discussing my hobbyhorse, namely, transport.  I cannot understand why the Government is not setting aggressive, proactive targets for emissions, particularly with regard to public transport.  Technology provides solutions and other countries are embracing it.  If the Government gave Dublin Bus a two-year timeframe in which to realise a particular target for all its fleet, it would demonstrate the way in which to meet our objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">The case is the same for electric transport.  We are settling for half measures at present.  We are talking about setting up small pilot projects in small areas in different cities.  Consequently, we will never achieve the economies of scale that will make electric vehicles viable in Ireland.  We must be much more ambitious, particularly in the transport sector.  The transport sector, although regarded by many as the biggest problem area, has the most potential for a dramatic shift from carbon-based fuels to much more sustainable sources of power.</p>

          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_896">In recent days, thousands of people across the country have been devastated by unprecedented floods.  Their houses, farms, livestock and even their lives have been put at risk.  These floods are a deadly warning to us as to what to expect regularly as the world warms up.  We must comfort and compensate those affected and protect vulnerable areas country-wide.  However, must we wait for someone to lose his or her life in Ireland before we act decisively and effectively to confront the reality of climate change?  Lives are already being lost in Africa and Asia.  Surely those lives have equal value to ours.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">At the summit in Copenhagen, the global community will, I hope, mark out a way forward for us all.  In that process, Ireland is a small country but it is a comparatively big polluter.  Following the agreement of the Kyoto Protocol, we did not live up to our responsibilities.  We have an opportunity and duty now to make up for our fecklessness.  In the absence of urgent global action, up to 250 million people across Africa could face severe water shortages by 2020.  For them, it is a matter of life or death.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">To reach the targets already set at EU level is the shared objective of all of us in this House.  It is important to acknowledge that progress has been made and that Members of the House such as the Minister, Deputy Gormley, were pioneers in leading the way, but it is also important to state the message is now shared by us all.  The reality is that we cannot make the cut if we, as legislators, continue with our old ways.  The road to hell, as we know from Kyoto, is paved with good aspirations, of which we certainly had our fill.  The way forward is not easy but it is clear.  We need a new dispensation and new legislation.  We need a new kind of governance to tackle climate change and we need it speedily.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">The best statement of intent that Ireland could make would be for our Taoiseach to go to the Copenhagen talks having published the heads of a climate change Bill with all-party support.  It would be a clear statement not only by Members of this House but also by those outside it.  Last January, the Labour Party became the first party to publish a climate change Bill.  That Bill provides a statutory framework and the certainty needed for Government, business and other stakeholders to encourage low-carbon economic growth and ensure any future Government, regardless of its political make-up, will meet its obligations.  Later in the year, I was asked by the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy, of which I am a member, to act as rapporteur on a report on the case for a climate change law.  This report was published last month and I am grateful it received all-party support.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The report examined proposals for legislation to set statutory limits and targets for emissions and carbon budgets.  We considered current and proposed legislation from around the globe with the aim of developing world-class legislation.  The UK legislation, which has already been enacted, was a useful model.  Having considered other legislation, we published an outline for a climate change Bill.  The approach we adopted was comprehensive, inclusive and ambitious.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister to adopt the same kind of approach.  It is important that they be ambitious for Copenhagen to deliver a legally binding agreement and to press the case as hard as they can.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">I appreciate the Minister is dampening unrealistic expectations but the talks will not be over until they are over.  We need to be pressing our case as hard as possible and we need to listen to major statements such as that of President Obama, who stated countries must reach a strong operational agreement that will confront the threat of climate change while serving as a stepping-stone to a legally binding treaty.  If there is such an agreement, it will represent a good week's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">The report on the climate change legislation can be acted upon in Ireland without having regard to other countries.  The way forward, as set out in the report, is based on the leadership of the Taoiseach to manage the project of tackling climate change.  One of the factors that frustrated the committee greatly was the fragmentation among Departments and a silo mentality that blocks an effective overall strategic response.  All Departments, particularly those responsible for the environment, transport and agriculture, must engage but such engagement can only happen if there is a robust statutory framework led by a Head of Government who has the power to hire and fire Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">I welcome the indications from the Taoiseach that he is to travel to Copenhagen and I wish him and the Minister well.  The Taoiseach has the authority, both at Copenhagen and at home, to transform the way we in Ireland can work together to respond to the challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister to send the report of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security to the Attorney General's office.  The work is done, the analysis has been carried out, and all-party agreement has been achieved.  The heads of the Bill could be published next week.  My fear is that if there is no sense of urgency before the summit in Copenhagen, the likelihood will be that the process will become bogged down between Departments.  I can imagine very easily how this can happen.  We certainly had a very lengthy process regarding the freedom of information legislation because it involved various Departments, thus creating its own difficulties.  We succeeded in the end but, by contrast with this legislation, time was not of the essence.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">Vague promises about achieving objectives early next year and restricting consultation totally to the inner circle do not engender confidence.  The case of the Minister and Taoiseach would be strengthened if they went to Copenhagen with the heads of a Bill published.  We may be a small country with limited negotiation powers, but we can underline the seriousness of our intent.  The architecture is set out in the report, including new institutional arrangements, more transparency, greater accountability and policy formation.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">The purpose is to create a framework for Ireland to achieve the long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to at least 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.  The Taoiseach will have overall responsibility to Parliament for meeting targets and for carbon budgets.  It proposes the setting up of an office of climate change and renewable energy under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach.  This office will be staffed primarily by personnel from the Environmental Protection Agency and Sustainable Energy Ireland and will be responsible for implementation and policy formulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">Provision is also made for a climate change commission, an independent and essential body made up of the best expertise we have, to advise on and monitor the project.  If we think we can do all this in-house we are fooling ourselves.  We have to draw on resources from outside this House, whether from the business sector, academia or wherever, if we are going to work in a united way to meet the targets.  Whatever targets are set or legally binding agreement is reached in Copenhagen, if we do not have our act together in terms of how we do our business, we will not deliver on them nor will we succeed.  Our job as politicians is to make sure our laws are meeting the required need.  In this instance climate change has to be a priority.  It is within our capability and area of responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">We must also recognise that the most vulnerable, here and abroad, are often those who need our protection.  The cost of mitigation measures must not fall disproportionately upon the poor.  The issue of fuel poverty must be addressed through the way in which we approach a reduction in carbon emissions.  Deputy Coveney mentioned his favourite projects.  My favourite project is very simple, that is, a national retrofit programme to put construction workers back to work and ensure that every house in Ireland is meeting the highest possible standards.  We all know that technologies are not fully advanced in terms of insulation but if we can improve the energy efficiency of our building stock it is something which should be done immediately.  A retrofit programme is not dependent on science or future developments.  We can do it from within our own resources with people who are already skilled in construction.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">The issue of overseas aid and provision for funding for climate change mitigation and the protection of such funding to which the Minister referred is something with which we all agree.  Such a policy is correct but we do not know if that is the way it will be.  The Minister tells us what he thinks, which I am glad to hear, but it is not of much help.  We need to know what the Government will do in terms of protecting a separate stream of funding.  If this debate does nothing else but clarifies that issue, it will be a good step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Speaking on the topic of climate justice last week, the former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson stated that climate change was an issue of justice.  It is fundamentally a human rights issue.  Listening to the speech and discussion, I was particularly struck by a Ugandan woman farmer who described how the seasons are no longer in place to guide farming and agricultural practice.  It is now a case of flood followed by a drought several times a year.  It is up-ending traditional agriculture.  Climate change is significantly affecting women in the developing world, a point which is largely overlooked.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">In this debate we need to acknowledge that climate change is a business opportunity.  It is not all about trying to meet targets, it is also about seeing opportunities for us to work our way out of a major recession.  We can have a positive impact in terms of overall employment if we make the correct decisions.  If we get our act together Ireland could become a leader in clean technologies.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">The Labour Party published a document, the energy revolution, recently and estimates some 80,000 jobs could be created in the area of clean technology.  Irish corporate leaders came out, which was very welcome, and made the point that they saw opportunities but needed certainly in order to make the long-term investments which have to be made if we are to change the way we generate electricity, and create and invest in new technologies.  For long-term investment in the low carbon sector there must be certainty.  Climate change law provides that certainty.  Corporate leaders have argued for the Bill the joint Oireachtas committee has published.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">The emissions trading scheme was mentioned.  It is outside the framework for our future arrangements, but there is no reason why there cannot be an oversight role in terms of the structure to which we referred in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">It is important that we do not rely on the economic downturn to ensure we meet our targets.  We have to invest in and legislate on this area to ensure that green technology opportunities are availed of so we can cut our emissions and come out of this recession as a low carbon economy and not one which has avoided dealing with the issues and challenges ahead.  In this regard I wish to argue the case for the heads of a Bill on climate change to be published before the Copenhagen meeting.  It is the correct time to publish such a Bill.  We will have to come together on this issue.  We cannot do it through the old adversarial model, where the Government proposes and the Opposition opposes.  That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The inspiration for the work I have done came directly from my experience and that of others in solving the crisis in Northern Ireland.  In the dark days when there was violence and bloodshed there the situation looked hopeless, but political determination delivered a solution because there was cross-party support and the Taoiseach took charge of the project and was working with the leader of another country in order to ensure the goals were realised.  That is the kind of approach we need again and every one of us must play our part.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_260">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_916">The context in which this debate is taking place, and indeed in many other assemblies around the world at the current time, is the Copenhagen summit which begins next week.  Climate change and, more basically, adverse weather conditions are of course issues of immediate concern in this country in the light of the impact of the recent floods and concerns that we are indeed witnessing different and unusual patterns of rainfall which reflect global changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">Most, if not all, of the weather we have witnessed in the past three weeks has never been experienced in living memory.  The unpredictability of our seasonal cycle is also a new phenomenon.  That is why it is so vital that the Copenhagen summit reaches a legally binding deal which is strong enough to tackle the challenge of climate change while being just and fair to developing countries.  There are different interests at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">For the developed countries, which by and large no longer depend to such a great extent on manufacturing industry, many of the targets set revolve around reducing emissions from heavy machinery.  For many developing countries, including some which have experienced significant industrial growth over recent decades, this is regarded as presenting a threat to their future development.  Striking a balance between the two which has the best interests of the world's population as a whole at its centre will not be easy.  There is also an onus on the developed western countries to set and implement binding effective targets for emission reductions, to develop new cleaner technologies so that the developing countries are not left to carry the main burden for the negative impact which earlier western and northern hemisphere industrialisation and use of carbon fuels has already had.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">The problem of climate change must be also approached in a positive manner so that moving away from older manufacturing systems based on the heavy use of carbon fuels is not seen as an inhibitor to economic growth but as an opportunity to boost the use of newer and cleaner technologies that do not present the same threat to the environment and which are more sustainable both in terms of the environment and future economic growth.  The key to this will be the greater utilisation of renewable energy sources which will not only have radical implications for the industrial economy but also for agriculture, with the potential for greatly increased production of energy crops and for entirely new economic sectors based on the production of energy from the wind and sea.  There is great potential but it needs to be driven forward politically.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">It is also important that the current recession is not used as an excuse by some developed industrialised countries to renege on their pledges under the Kyoto Agreement to supply aid to assist the developing countries in their efforts to combat the effects of climate change and to help limit their emissions as their economies grow.  This is causing a major political rift between rich and poor states in the United Nations and threatens to derail a global agreement being reached at Copenhagen.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">For example, as of May, while rich countries have so far pledged $18 billion in adaptation aid, less than $1 billion has been delivered.  According to the UN, $50 billion to $70 billion a year needs to be invested immediately to help the poor countries adapt to extreme floods and droughts.  Nearly every week we witness on world news the kinds of effects about which we are talking.  While we are dealing with the devastating effects of the flooding here on individuals and the large costs involved in repairing the damage, we can empathise with the even greater scale of the devastation that has been visited on many developing countries in recent times.  The communities affected have also found it difficult to recover because of the restricted resources in those countries and sometimes political factors which inhibit the supply of aid and reconstruction funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">Apart from reaching concrete decisions at Copenhagen on the practical steps that need to be taken to address the environmental issues, there is also the question of what finance will be provided to help developing countries tackle climate change.  There is also the question of how that finance will be controlled with many developing countries calling for a new mechanism into which they have more input than they have into programmes imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.  Otherwise they claim the developed countries will simply use it in the same manner as the IMF in order to impose restrictions and austerity on the developing countries which will undermine their ability to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Apart from whatever is agreed at the Copenhagen summit, which will of course become binding on this State once ratified by the EU, there is also the need to press forward in this country with ambitious targets in, for example, renewable technology, energy efficiency and public transport.  That of course requires significant public investment, but it is investment that will bear fruit in terms of future growth and jobs.  There is a great opportunity to create badly needed jobs and that opportunity should not be lost.  However, in the light of the Government's attitude in this regard, the question is whether the political will and vision exists to take those steps rather than sacrifice such a strategy to the current demand for massive cuts in public spending which while they may be thrifty in the short term will inhibit future growth and place this country at a disadvantage in making the most of the opportunities that arise once the current downturn comes to an end.  If the Government does so it will have overwhelming support across the island and it should not miss this opportunity.  We need to use that job creation potential to take people off the long dole queues.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">What makes this debate even more relevant than it might otherwise have been is the impact of the recent floods, the effects of which are still being felt in parts of the country.  All of us sympathise with those whose homes, farms and businesses have been damaged, in some cases beyond repair.  Last Wednesday I visited Carlow and saw for myself the effects of the flooding there.  The previous weekend I visited Cork and last night I was in Sallins, County Kildare, where I saw the devastation as a result of the recent weeks of rain.  That pales into insignificance when one compares it with the devastation in Third World countries which have suffered as a result of total and absolute neglect by the developed world in dealing with the problem of global warming.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">It is frightening to think of the damage which a relatively small change in normal weather patterns can have, how quickly infrastructure that has been built over so many years can be destroyed or badly damaged and how services which we have come to think of as almost guaranteed, including domestic water and electricity supply, can be threatened.  That perhaps places in context the effects adverse weather has had in less developed countries which are less well able to cope with such events.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">The impact of the flooding, therefore, apart from the immediate steps that need to be taken to assist those individuals and communities which have been affected, must also make us more aware of the potential that even worse conditions in the future might have.  Would this country be able to cope with a more prolonged period of such weather?  Are we taking the correct measures to ensure we will be able to do so?  Part of the answer relates to concrete measures that can be taken now but it also relates to what will take place in Copenhagen if, as we are told, the impact of carbon emissions is responsible for changing weather patterns with further radical changes in patterns likely in the future.  That is why it is vital that any measures that can reduce the harmful impact of carbon emissions are agreed and implemented.  It is also important that those measures be implemented in such a manner as to ensure that overall sustainable economic development is not adversely affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">Another issue that needs to be addressed regarding the flooding here relates to the building of housing developments in places, which while they may not have experienced flooding in the past ten, 20 or even 40 years, are historically known to be vulnerable to the impact of heavy rain on rivers, lakes and water basins.  Reckless planning driven by the greed of unscrupulous developers was supported by a banking system that encouraged it and appeased by certain elements within the political arena here.  Some of the developments in question were built even in places that have townland names which suggest that every once in a while they might expect flooding.  One was even built on the bed of a drained lake.  As someone said on the radio last week, people had never built in certain places for good reasons and yet planning permission was given in recent years for such developments.  It would perhaps be worth re-examining some of those planning decisions and certainly it might be worthwhile revoking any which have been granted for similar places.  I understand the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has also made that comment recently.  Many of us who have been involved in local authorities have seen the anomalies between planning permissions granted in certain areas and the detrimental effect they have had on our landscape.  In particular in some areas where the water tables were quite close to the surface, unrestricted planning permissions were granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">Where people's homes have been destroyed in places where historical evidence might have decided against the granting of permission to build them, it also might be appropriate to ensure those people are compensated, perhaps by being given another dwelling by the developers involved.  Developers who lobbied politicians by any method and were able to obtain planning permission are accountable, as are the local authorities who granted permission and, in some instances, An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The necessity of a successful conclusion to the Copenhagen summit cannot be over emphasised.  Developed countries need to ensure the real concerns of developing countries are taken into consideration and the necessary finance is available to ensure these countries are not placed in a more vulnerable position.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</from>
          <p eId="para_930">I wish to share my time with Deputy Cuffe.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">This is one of the last opportunities the House will have to discuss this issue before the Irish Government takes its place among the nations at Copenhagen.  The events of the past ten days have been a painful reminder of the impact climate change will have on our country and, while some people might debate whether climate change or poor planning is at fault, the fact is that we are faced with major climate change.  Nobody can deny that we will experience such events on a more regular basis, with homes and businesses threatened, rivers bursting their banks and perhaps even lives endangered.  The climate change expert Professor John Sweeney recently said that rainfall levels previously seen once every 30 years will become, by the mid-21st century, a one-in-ten-year event.  In this context I welcome the launch by my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, of the statutory planning guidelines, The Planning System and Flood Risk Management.  There can be no denying the magnitude of the challenge facing the world in the coming weeks at Copenhagen.  Let us hope we have success in the years ahead in combating climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The world needs, collectively, to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to 90% by 2050.  We need to be flexible with these targets in the event that the precipice of a temperature increase of more than 2°C is reached.  We need a global deal that encompasses the five pillars of mitigation, adaptation, technology, financing and capacity building, and recognises the disproportionate effects of climate change on the developing world and the challenges, such as poverty and lack of economic development, faced by such countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">The issue of economic development leads me to a central point in the debate on climate change.  We are facing a challenge not just to prevent the weather from becoming a monster but also to change our economic order.  In a world approaching peak oil and in which the current means of production are potentially fatal to the planet, we need an economic order that addresses the problems not only of capitalism but also of what is called resourcism.  We need sustainability.  This goes to the heart of energy policy, planning, transport, economic development and the distribution of wealth.  Economic growth, consumption and expansion for the sake of it cannot endure much longer.  I hope a deal is reached in Copenhagen.  If not, we will need to think hard about where we are going with our globally accepted and binding targets.  There is no alternative; we must hope there is a deal.  I hope Europe leads the way in providing the financing, adaptation and technology policies required to provide climate change justice with any deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">People often ask me how they can help to mitigate climate change.  We can all do our share.  We can buy food with fewer food miles, change the way we farm to reduce emissions, and change the way we do business by conducting it in a more sustainable way and using renewable energy.  We can change the way we travel and live our lives.  This is the power of one.  If people take one message from this discussion, it should be that we are not hopeless in the face of climate change.  We have a Government that is willing to tackle it; we have Copenhagen to look forward to; and, individually, we can do our small piece.  Climate change is the greatest moral imperative and challenge of our times.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ciarán Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_936">I am delighted to hear it.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">With the week that is in it, this is a good time to concentrate our minds on the challenge of climate change.  There are two issues on which we must focus, namely, where flooding occurred and why, and the need for proper planning on this island.  We must look long and hard at the planning decisions that were made in the past and consider whether they were the right ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">We must be careful about jumping to the conclusion that the floods of the past ten days can be directly attributed to climate change.  After all, we must not confuse weather with climate.  Nonetheless, it is likely that climate change will bring more extreme weather events, a good example of which is increasing rainfall and consequent flooding.  That is the lesson I heard when I went to see an excellent presentation by Professor Jean-Pascal van Ypersele in the Mansion House last week.  Professor van Ypersele, who is the vice-chairperson of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, used raw science to show us what is going on and what needs to be done.  It is a call for action, not just at a global or national level but within all our lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">We must ask ourselves the hard question: are we doing enough in terms of how we consume and how we spew out carbon?  It is easy to say one would love to do more but cannot because one's lifestyle does not allow it.  People who say they need to fly to Majorca for a holiday or travel long distances for other reasons must ask themselves some long and hard questions.  Within all our lives there is a considerable amount we can do, whether it be choosing public transport, considering emissions carefully when purchasing new vehicles, or changing our diets.  Many people laugh at the suggestion that we should eat less meat; a British junior Minister said that eating one less sausage a day would go a long way in this regard.  This is true.  Those who eat less meat in their diets are responsible for far fewer carbon emissions by cattle or other animals.  This is a good thing and part of what needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">There is quite a debate at present about whether the United States or China could contribute more to tackling climate change.  In the United States, the can-do attitude, when it comes to the fore, is fantastic at achieving a complete change in direction quickly, which I applaud.  The innovation and roll-out of new technologies such as wind energy generation across the US, particularly once the grid is working at a national level, will achieve a lot.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">We tend to concentrate on the fact that China is now the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and that a new coal-fired power station is opened every week, but much of what it is doing is in fact phasing out old coal stations, and the efficiency being achieved in the new stations is far ahead of the equivalent stations in the US.  This should be pointed out.  Although China has what we might call a rather centralised planning system, it is also good at changing direction when required.  This will be done and China will come on board.  The principles of both contraction and convergence are required.  In other words, all countries, particularly in the West, must reduce their emissions and we must all converge towards a common allocation of carbon per capita.  In the developed world we have much further to go in this regard, and we must provide the technology to developing countries to tackle climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Much of what can be done is in the area of construction. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, within a few months of taking office, had racked up by 40% the requirements in the building regulations, but we must go further, to 60%. That will mean not just 100 millimetres or 150 millimetres of insulation in the attic.  It will mean air-tight houses and a completely different way of building to the way many buildings were slapped up in the boom years.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">It is not just about what we build, but where we build it.  A map from An Post's address creation system illustrates where new addresses were created in the past five years.  Each little dot on the map — one can see only the blur — represents a new address.  I do not see much evidence of avoiding flood plains in this image.  I do not see much evidence of locating new homes in the right places so that one can commute less and be within walking distance of the school, the pub and the church.  That is a call to arms.  We need to provide proper planning.  Deputy Hogan accused my colleague, the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, of bringing in social engineering at its worst.  The Deputy also stated that he was sure the Minister means well, but it reminded him of soviet dictators.  In reality, we need proper planning to tackle climate change.  The measures the Minister is bringing in will help to deal not only with flooding, but also with tackling climate change.  I look forward to some kind of a deal, if not in Copenhagen then in Mexico.  The foundation stones need to be set in place before the end of this year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_264">
          <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_944">I wish to share time with Deputy Bannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">The Copenhagen conference has taken on much more significance now that the White House has announced that President Obama and his Chinese counterpart will attend.  More significantly, the White House has announced that President Obama will commit to reducing American greenhouse gas emissions to 17% of 2005 levels by 2020, to 30% by 2030, 42% by 2040 and a staggering 83% by 2050.  As previous speakers stated, they are just commitments.  As we are aware, in the past US commitments have been empty so we need to make them legal.  They are still ambitious targets and I wonder if the Minister could adopt them for our country.  I am sure they are realisable.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">In looking through papers in preparation for the debate I came across a good document from the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government of Ireland with which the Minister is probably familiar, A Survey of Climate Change since the IPCC 4 — the survey of climate change since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2007.  The evidence presented in this report by Professor Ray Bates of UCD shows that the underlying trends are continuing — an increase in atmospheric CO<sup>2</sup>, an increase in global average temperatures and a rise in sea level, in addition to the natural cyclical changes and normal climate variation which superimpose short-term and regional variability on these trends.  The report concludes that “global climate change is real and continuing at a steady pace”.  I suppose that is stating the obvious.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">If one looks at our record since 1990, six of the ten warmest years on record in modern times have occurred since 1990.  Weather stations across this island have reported a 0.72° centigrade increase in average temperature since 1980, a decrease in the number of frost days, a decrease in the length of the frost season, etc.  This country has a major issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">As someone who has always taken an interest in this area, who taught environmental science for eight years and who looked for scrubbers to be installed at Moneypoint — I am on record in the Seanad for doing so at a time when they could have been installed for approximately €40 million and now it will cost the ESB over €240 million — I do not see progress being made.  For example, approximately a quarter of the wind energy is produced in the Kerry region.  Even if there is a demand for wind energy, the grid does not have adequate capacity to take that energy from the Stacks Mountains.  We are not realising the potential of wind energy generating capacity and that is obvious right across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">Our gate system is totally outdated as well.  People with planning permission must wait for Gate 4.  They are right to have a connection, whereas there are people on Gate 3 who are a long way from connecting into the grid and are ahead of them.  The entire system must change.  In addition, I am aware of two proposals by ESBI in Kerry to look at wave energy which are likely to be held up for four or five years in trying to get a foreshore licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">We talk of green energy in this country but really we are not at the races.  Much lip-service is being paid in this House to the issue, but if the Minister was out there on the ground he would see that, while progress has been made, we are not capitalising on capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">In the area of legislation, although Deputy McManus is not present, I compliment the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  It provides an outline of what the Minister can do.  If this were implemented, the Minister could put Ireland ahead of the rest of the world.  This is one example of how an Oireachtas committee can be effective and come up with good solutions.  This is an area of major possibilities.  It is one in which we can lead the world, but we are just not doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">GE announced in August or September that it would look at offshore wind generation.  It is looking at some place in Europe to design and manufacture turbines.  At present, the Dutch make approximately €5 billion out of wind turbines.  We make little out of wind technology because we do not manufacture them here.  We must look at the broader issue as well.  There is a great opportunity to get GE, for example, to set up here to design and manufacture its turbines in Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_265">
          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_953">No matter on which side of the climate change debate one comes down, whether one considers it is causing global warming or global cooling, the clear message is that action must be taken.  Whether climate change is a man-made crisis or part of cyclical climate patterns, the results, as we are seeing in terms of unprecedented flooding in this country, are worrying and could become catastrophic.  That is the situation when I visited many townlands in my constituency in close proximity to the Shannon at the weekend where there were farms flooded to a depth of four to six feet and people had to leave their homes and take up residence in local hotels.  I hope the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, will be able to give some support to those people as time goes by because the difficulty is unlikely to abate before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">What each side of the debate expects but is failing to get from the Government is co-operation and input.  It is a farce that there is no firm commitment from the Government on when the much needed climate change Bill will be published.  While it is simplistic to blame the flooding of the past couple of weeks on climate change, flooding has been a feature of Ireland, particularly in the west and midlands, throughout our history.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">As we know to our cost in the Midlands, floods are part of the river process and will be well into the future.  Fine Gael is fully committed to tackling the causes and effects of climate change.  This commitment has led to the creation of the most far-reaching green policy ever produced in this country.  The emphasis is on targets allied with action.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">The Fianna Fáil-Green Government — particularly its so-called Green members — have shown that they can talk the talk but, as we know, promises come easily, especially on the doorsteps at election time.  The follow-up is conspicuously absent, however.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_970">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_971">I am pleased to have this opportunity to present the Inland Fisheries Bill 2009 for consideration by the House.  The main purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector through the establishment of a new national inland fisheries body, which will be known as inland fisheries Ireland.  This body will replace the existing central and seven regional fisheries boards established in 1980.  The <i>status quo</i> is no longer valid almost 30 years after the design of the current structures was put in place.  Too much has changed in the intervening years, such as our understanding of the environment, the complex interplay of habitats and species, ecological biodiversity and the status of our inland fisheries stocks.  Equally, too much is set to change to allow the continuation of the existing regime without modification.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">The restructuring now proposed is in line with the programme of rationalisation of State bodies generally announced by the Minister for Finance last year during his budget day address.  By way of background, freshwater lakes cover approximately 2% of the area of the State.  There are also in the region of 13,840 km of main channel rivers.  These freshwater systems are inhabited by a variety of fish species.  They include game species such as salmon, sea and brown trout, as well as coarse species such as pike and bream.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">The State's role in the inland fisheries resource is concerned with the protection, management and development of freshwater fisheries throughout Ireland, including the management and surveillance of stocks listed in the habitats directive.  In addition, the remit covers certain activities at sea, including protection of salmon and sea trout, and the support of sea angling.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">It is widely acknowledged that the inland fisheries resource, across all species, is under serious threat from environmental factors, including pollution, habitat degradation, water quality factors and over exploitation.  The Government has faced up to hard decisions in recent times in the interest of conserving our salmon stocks, including closing the commercial mixed stock salmon fishery, the creation of a salmon hardship fund at a cost of €30 million to provide relief to those affected by the closure of the mixed stock fishery, the unequivocal adoption of scientific advice in the management of the salmon fishery and measures to protect our stocks of European eel.  There is more to do, however, so it is imperative to put the right structures in place now, which will ensure the conservation and sustainable exploitation of our inland fisheries resource in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">While the Department has overall policy responsibility for the conservation, management, regulation and development of the inland fisheries resource, it is assisted in its mission by the central and regional fisheries boards.  Other agencies such as the Marine Institute, the Loughs Agency, An Bord lascaigh Mhara and the ESB also play an important role in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">In cognisance of the growing obligations on Ireland under European law and, in particular, responsibilities under the habitats directive and water framework directive, the Government has decided that inland fisheries Ireland should manage and report on its operations on the basis of the river basin districts established for the implementation of the water framework directive.  This directive sets a framework for the comprehensive management of water resources in the EU, within a common approach and with common objectives, principles and basic measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">Aligning the management of inland fisheries Ireland in this way will enable an integrated ecosystem approach to be adopted, which will be fully co-ordinated with the structures already in place for the implementation of the water framework directive for environmental and habitat protection across all animal species.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">It will also better enable those matters to be dealt with on a co-ordinated North-South basis and will be beneficial in terms of implementing future EU-sponsored measures in the sector.  Between them, the central and regional fisheries boards are made up of over 150 board members, with each of the regional boards having up to 23 members per board.  Such numbers are unwieldy by any standard and can lead to divergent interests and competing aims between different stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">As we have seen in other areas, there is a need at board level for a high-level focus on corporate governance and strategic issues.  This is best achieved by putting in place a small, focused board in State bodies.  Accordingly, it is proposed that the board of inland fisheries Ireland will consist of nine members.  This does not mean there will be no role for existing board members who have a genuine interest in inland fisheries and wish to make a legitimate contribution to the future development of the resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">The Bill requires inland fisheries Ireland to establish a national inland fisheries forum, which will provide stakeholder input into policy formulation.  It is envisaged that there will be representation across the spectrum of stakeholders on this forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">I am aware that stakeholders have been championing the establishment of regional advisory committees effectively replicating the existing regime.  Stakeholder involvement is vital at a local level.  However, it needs to be properly structured and channelled to ensure that the input from diverse and sometimes competing stakeholders can be utilised to best effect.  Such mechanisms should be operated by inland fisheries Ireland through the national inland fisheries forum.  I would expect the new body to put in place local advisory structures, which will ensure that the expertise and goodwill that exists in the regions will not be lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">As part of its remit, the national inland fisheries forum will replace the national salmon commission in providing advice on the management of the national salmon resource, while extending its competencies to other species also.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">Following on from the approach adopted in the Broadcasting Act, I have made provision for the involvement of the Oireachtas joint committee in the appointment of some of the members to inland fisheries Ireland.  This continues a positive practice in the appointment of persons to State bodies and I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the House as part of this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">Following the resolution of the rod licence dispute in the late 1980s, eight fisheries co-operative societies were established.  The principal function of those societies was to participate in the development of trout and coarse fisheries by raising funds through the issue of share certificates and making grants available for the development of trout and coarse fisheries for the benefit of the public.  Their performance has varied considerably and, while recognising the huge commitment and effort on the part of the existing membership, it has proved difficult to improve the societies' accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">In considering options for the rationalisation of the sector, it will be more beneficial for the co-operative societies to cease and for resources currently deployed through them to be used as a basis for a grant scheme for local development groups.  Such a scheme will be developed and operated by Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">There are more than 400 staff currently employed by the fisheries boards.  The staffing needs of the new structure will be met through existing resources and, in keeping with the Government's commitment to optimise the use of resources, there will be no increase in the overall staff numbers in the inland fisheries service.</p>

          <p eId="para_987">There is no decrease, either, since the Government is supposed to be rationalising it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_280" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_988">No, we said there would be no increase in staff numbers in the inland fisheries sector.  Given the embargoes in place at the moment, it is quite likely that there will be fewer people working here than more.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">I take this opportunity to stress that the terms and conditions of existing staff will not be lessened and the House will note that there is specific provision in the Bill to ensure that this is the case.  I recognise the energy and commitment of the competent inland fisheries workforce.  It is important that this energy is harnessed to enable the sustainable exploitation of the resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">There are no Exchequer costs associated with this Bill.  The reduction in board members alone, which I mentioned earlier, will bring about initial and immediate savings of some €300,000 per annum.  Furthermore, there is potential for additional savings and a better use of existing resources as a result of the replacement of the Central Fisheries Board and seven regional fisheries boards with a single body and the elimination of the National Salmon Commission and eight fisheries co-operative societies.  The House will appreciate that it is difficult to quantify these saving as they will occur over time.  I expect them to be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">The McCarthy report suggested potential for savings of €4 million from this restructuring and while it does not set out a detailed regime for bringing about such savings, this new body will, from the outset, have a clear focus on efficiency and value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">I now propose to outline the main provisions of the Bill.  For the convenience of the House a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published and this provides a synopsis of the provisions.  The Bill consists of 80 sections and five schedules.  Its single purpose is the establishment of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  However, for the purposes of better regulation, a number of existing provisions of the legislation governing inland fisheries management are restated.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">The restated provisions are unaltered apart from changes to ensure that they apply to Inland Fisheries Ireland and some minor drafting amendments.  This ensures that as many provisions as possible pertaining to the new body are contained in a single statute to make it easier for those referring to the legislation.  Part 1 contains standard provisions dealing with definitions, repeals and expenses connected with the Bill.  Section 5 provides that Inland Fisheries Ireland will be established on a day determined by the Minister by Order.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">Part 2 sets out the provisions governing Inland Fisheries Ireland and transitional arrangements required to ensure the smooth changeover to the new structures.  Inland Fisheries Ireland will assume the functions of the existing central and regional fisheries boards and in addition will undertake a number of new functions which are set out in section 7.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">The principal role of Inland Fisheries Ireland will be the protection and conservation of the State's inland fisheries resource.  It will also be required to promote, support, facilitate and advise the Minister on the conservation, protection, management, development and improvement of inland fisheries, including sea angling.  In addition, Inland Fisheries Ireland will be expected to take a greater role in the development of policy and national strategies relating to inland fisheries and the implementation and delivery of such strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">In recognition of the need and the value of stakeholder participation in the sector, provision has been made in section 7 for the establishment of a national inland fisheries forum.  Inland Fisheries Ireland will also become responsible for the establishment of a standing scientific committee which will advise on technical and scientific matters relating to the management of the State's inland fisheries resource.  This replaces the standing scientific committee established by the National Salmon Commission.  Section 7 also ensures that Inland Fisheries Ireland has the necessary powers for the continuation of the issuing of licences and striking of rates in accordance with the existing fisheries legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">Section 8 ensures that all of the functions conferred on the central and regional fisheries boards under the existing statute are transferred to Inland Fisheries Ireland on the establishment day.  Section 9 provides that Inland Fisheries Ireland will manage and report its business on the basis of river basin districts defined for the purposes of the European Water Framework Directive.  This section allows for the modification, by order, of this arrangement if necessary.  I have already set out the reasoning behind this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">Section 12 sets out the membership and method of appointment of members to Inland Fisheries Ireland.  The Bill provides that it will have a board of nine people.  The chairman and two others will be appointed on the Minister's nomination, two will be appointed on the nomination of the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, while one will be a staff representative appointed following an election process.  The remaining three will be appointed having regard to the advice of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This follows the approach adopted in the Broadcasting Act 2009.  In addition, it is proposed to include the CEO as an <i>ex officio</i> member of the board as is standard practice in State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">I have long maintained that the board should be small and contain a strong focus relevant to the business of Inland Fisheries Ireland and to the general issue of good corporate governance.  The provisions in the Bill achieve this.  This is of particular importance given the significant annual budget for which the new body will be responsible.  The Bill provides that potential appointees to the board must have had experience of or have shown capacity in one or more of a number of areas, including recreational fisheries, angling, commercial fishing and ownership of fisheries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">These competencies are no more or less important than the other competencies listed in the Bill, such as business or commercial affairs, environmental or biodiversity matters and legal or regulatory affairs, all of which are essential to effective stewardship of a State-sponsored body.  It is my intention that members appointed to the board will have the necessary expertise and competencies to lead Inland Fisheries Ireland to fully deliver on its potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">Section 13 sets out the procedures for the election of a staff representative to the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Section 14 makes provision in relation to the term of office of members to Inland Fisheries Ireland and provides for a system of rolling appointments.  This should ensure that the corporate knowledge of the board is preserved at all times while also bringing fresh ideas and faces to the boardroom.  Sections 15 to 22 set out the usual best practice procedures in relation to the board including, conditions of office, removal of members from office, resignations, casual vacancies and meetings and procedures of the board.  Sections 23 to 27 make provisions with regard to the CEO of Inland Fisheries Ireland and provide for the delegation of the functions of the CEO to other staff members and the further sub-delegation of such functions.  Sections 28 and 29 provide that the CEO shall be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and to all other committees of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">Section 30 makes provision in relation to the appointment of employees to Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Section 32 contains standard provisions relating to superannuation.  Section 33 restates the equivalent section of the Fisheries Act 1980 and provides for the preparation by Inland Fisheries Ireland of a staff scheme for the regulation, control and management of its staff.  Sections 35 and 36 contain standard provisions dealing with standards of integrity and unauthorised disclosure of confidential information.  Standard provision is also made in sections 38 to 44 in respect of corporate plans, estimates, grants, accounts and audits applicable to Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">Sections 45 to 53 set out the transitional arrangements for the changeover to the new structure and provides for the dissolution of the central and regional fisheries boards.  Provision is made for the transfer of property, assets, rights and liabilities, including superannuation liabilities, to Inland Fisheries Ireland and to ensure that existing contracts, agreements and arrangements remain in force.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">Section 46 facilitates the transfer of employees of the existing boards to Inland Fisheries Ireland on terms and conditions of employment no less favourable than those enjoyed immediately prior to the transfer.  Employees of Inland Fisheries Ireland will be covered by a broad range of employment protections under employment law.  Sections 52 and 53 require Inland Fisheries Ireland to prepare final accounts and a final annual report in respect of the central and regional fisheries boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">Part 3 restates existing provisions of fisheries legislation which deal with the administration of inland fisheries.  These provisions remain unchanged apart from some minor drafting amendments and necessary changes to ensure that they apply to Inland Fisheries Ireland.  In section 54, which restates provisions dealing with the by-law making powers of the Minister, the value of fines applicable for breaches of by-laws have been increased in accordance with the consumer price index to bring them into line with current values.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Part 4 restates a number of provisions of the Fisheries Act 1980 dealing with offences and legal proceedings under existing fisheries legislation.  Again, monetary penalties have been increased in accordance with the consumer price index to ensure they are in line with current values.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">In most cases, the fines were set in 1980 and have not been changed since.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">Section 77 restates the equivalent section of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2000 which put in place a regime of on-the-spot fines for minor inland fisheries offences.  The existing provisions have been amended slightly in order to allow that different amounts can be prescribed in respect of different offences.  Part 5 restates certain provisions of the Fisheries Act 1980 that deal with miscellaneous matters, including powers of the Minister in operating a fishery.  There have been no changes introduced other than to ensure the provisions apply to inland fisheries Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">There are five Schedules to the Bill.  Schedule 1 sets out the repeal of existing fisheries legislation.  Schedules 2 and 3 detail amendments to existing statutes and statutory instruments, which ensure that references to the central and regional fisheries boards are appropriately changed.  Schedules 4 and 5 restate the Fifth Schedule to the Fisheries Act 1980 and the schedule to the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2000, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">In conclusion, this Bill is an important measure in delivering new management structures for the inland fisheries resource.  The inland fisheries management must be equipped for the challenges of the future at a time of public sector reform.  I am determined that every opportunity must be availed of to effect economies and attain efficiencies from within the system to deliver further value for money against the significant Exchequer investment in this resource.  That said, I wish to safeguard the inland fisheries resource in the face of significant upheaval caused by demands of contemporary 21st century society for spatial development and economic progress, past excesses in exploitation of stocks and impending climate change factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">I wish to take this opportunity to put on the record of the House my appreciation for all those who have served on the existing boards and for their dedication and commitment to our national resource.  I am sure they will continue to play a valuable role and know we all share the best interests for the future of the sector.</p>

        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_281">
          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_1012">It will not come as a surprise to the Minister of State that one reason a division took place in the House earlier today regarding this legislation was because its handling, in respect of the length of time it has taken to bring it to the House, has been farcical.  For the past three years in a row and more, Members have been obliged to extend the regional fisheries boards as currently constituted.  Each time, they have been told by the sitting Minister, who, to be fair has not always been the current incumbent, that by the following summer or by this time next year, new structures would be in place and, therefore, new elections to the regional fisheries boards were not required.  Each time, however, nothing has happened.  Each time, Members waited for another year when, through ministerial order, the request again was made to postpone elections to fisheries boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">While I am unsure whether there is anything to be gained by harping on about this issue because Members are getting on with the task now, it is important to note when one has made a bags of something.  Although the legislation's content looks pretty good, it is clear there has been no ministerial drive or priority accorded to this issue.  Consequently, the Bill has only reached the House two weeks before the Dáil is due to break up and it is clear that Members will not complete their deliberations on it before the end of the year either.  As a result, I expect the Minister will be obliged to return to the House in ten days or less to ask Members to postpone the elections to the regional fisheries boards yet again, in order that they can conclude the debate on this legislation early next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">This is no way in which to do business, particularly when Members have listened repeatedly to the same mantra to the effect that this issue would be dealt with by the following year and that Members should work with the Government on it.  Last year, out of frustration, the two Opposition spokespersons refused to work with the Government on this issue and opposed the deferral of elections to regional fisheries boards.  They again were promised that this issue would be dealt with by the end of the summer but, again, that did not happen and Members find themselves back in the same position once more.  I acknowledge the risk of boring the House and I will not go on about this subject for too long.  I commend those who have worked on the legislation as they appear to have put together a comprehensive Bill.  However, it contains a number of items that I wish to discuss.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">I recognise and commend the work that has been done by many people in both the Central Fisheries Board and in regional fisheries boards, some of whom I have got to know through correspondence during my time as a public representative.  It is not easy for people who are in an existing structure to adapt to an entirely new structure that is being set up.  I recognise this has been a difficult change to accept within some of the regional boards in particular.  However, I believe the Minister is correct to press ahead with his proposals and that it should have happened before now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">I believe that people who do not fish often do not appreciate the resource the inland waterways of Ireland constitute in respect of tourism potential, commercial fishing potential and aquaculture.  Ireland is blessed with a fantastic network of natural resources in the form of its inland waterways and these resources should be exploited to the full in a sustainable manner that can ensure that, in 50 years' time, people still will be able to enjoy them.  Unfortunately, there have been examples of overfishing, collapsed fish stocks within certain rivers in particular and of mistakes that have been made.  I believe it probably makes sense that with a single co-ordinated body, the risk of making such mistakes in the future will be minimised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">As for the new structures, it is proposed to amalgamate the Central Fisheries Board, seven regional boards, the national salmon commission and eight fisheries co-operative societies into a single new body to be called inland fisheries Ireland.  Lessons must be learned and although it is overused as an example, I refer to the establishment of the HSE, whereby regional health boards were abolished and a single centralised body was set up.  This has not worked in respect of understanding and developing proper health plans on a regional basis.  The concern among those who are involved in this industry, as well as among the many board members who no longer will be involved formally in the structures, is that the issues which are specific to their regions will not be catered for in a detailed way by a single centralised body, which will receive advice from a standing scientific committee and will receive policy suggestions from a national inland fisheries forum.  Although not ideal, the manner in which current structures work provides a real voice to local anglers, fishermen, angling clubs, draft net users and a whole series of other local interest groups because in a very Irish way, people get to know who is locally responsible for the management of inland waterways in their region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">The idea of holding a national inland fisheries forum in the midlands or elsewhere is unlikely to attract a level of interest to encourage people to make representations or provide the financial supports for them to travel to it.  We need to ensure those who cannot afford the time or costs to travel a relatively long distance to a meeting are catered for by moving the forum around the country.  It must focus on different regions at various meetings rather than having a centralised meeting room outside of Dublin.  Many local anglers have limited resources but feel their local concerns are being listened to under the current structures.  It is important, therefore, that they are catered for in the proposed restructuring.  I note the Minister of State has taken on board this point and hope he will consider it between now and Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">I accept the whittling down of 150 members of the central and regional fisheries boards to a nine-member board of IFI makes sense.  However, regional representation will need to be considered in this context.  While the legislation has catered for gender balance on the board, it should also ensure regional balance.  Section 12(5) states, "a person shall not be appointed by the Minister to be a member of IFI unless he or she has had experience of or shown capacity in agriculture, aquaculture, business or commercial affairs" and so forth.  The management of waterways in various areas can present different issues concerning types of fish stocks, challenges and risks from aquaculture and commercial fishing, factors which will be known only to regional representatives.  As important as it is to have a balance of skill sets, it is also important to have a balance of regional representation on the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">The new districts being defined under the European Communities water policy negotiations 2003 roughly represent the regional fisheries boards areas of the past.  This is important because people are used to the management of their region, its skill sets and resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">Will the Minister consider the involvement of the new body in monitoring and being responsible for sea angling?  Sea angling, of which I have much experience in Cork Harbour, increasingly involves travel to reefs, offshore areas and fish-breeding areas.  It tends to transcend the set borders of regional fisheries board areas.  Inland fisheries tend to be defined specifically by rivers and riverbanks while sea fisheries are more of a grey area.  Often there is no direct relationship between the fish that come out to sea at river mouths and those caught by sea anglers off the Old Head of Kinsale, for example.  Sea angling is not as regulated or monitored in the same way as angling in inland waterways.  The IFI, when established, should consider some measures for sea angling.  We do not want to over-regulate the activity since the whole idea of going fishing centres on the freedom it involves.  At the same time, safety standards need to be ensured and the type of fishing monitored.  Will the Minister of State clarify the Bill's intentions in this regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Another issue concerns the linkage between other bodies involved in inland waterways such as the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the ESB.  Work needs to be done on an ongoing basis, particularly with the ESB, concerning stocking levels such as ensuring salmon can return to spawning grounds over ESB dams in, for example, the River Lee basin catchment area.  Saying that, it would be some salmon to get back up the Lee dams at the moment with the amount of water coming down.  Does the Minister intend to include these bodies, as well as other representative groups from the aquaculture industry in the proposed national inland fisheries forum?</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">The aquaculture industry has enormous potential in Ireland.  We have some of the most ideal inlets, bays and harbours for aquaculture in the world, particularly in Cork and the south west.  I am not sure we have got it right to date, however.  It must be developed in a sustainable manner sympathetic with the management of harbours and other inland waterways.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">Regarding the proposed procedures for appointments to the IFI board, it must be remembered that any organisation is driven by its board.  The quality of appointees to the IFI board will be extremely important.  There was recently a long debate on the appointment of the board for the new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  The same principle of asking an Oireachtas committee to become involved has been employed in this Bill.  The committee proposes names to the Minister which, unless for some extraordinary reason, he or she will accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">I wish to share some of the experience the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources had in this process.  We have taken legal and human resources advice, advertised and invited expressions of interest.  We have gone through an initial interview process with a view to narrowing down the choice.  A total of 140 people applied and we want to narrow it down to a much smaller number for secondary interviews.  Then we want to narrow it down to 12 people, of whom we will choose four.  It has been, and continues to be, a long, tedious process, which, I hope will produce a good result.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">The quality of the candidates is extraordinary in terms of their background and past success.  The message is that there are many talented people seeking to be on such boards who have lots to offer, are highly qualified and are not seeking financial return.  They wish to be part of a State body that is running a sector of the country.  Many of them have never even considered the option in the past because they assumed they had to be preferred by a Minister, have political connection or be recommended by a Department.  When one advertises and seeks expressions of interest, one gets an entirely new type of person applying for this type of role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">The irony of what we are doing currently is that the Minister's process for choosing his nominees for the board is one that has always been in place; he asks his officials to recommend names and he chooses them according to his own reasons and is not answerable to anyone.  On the other hand, the committee is trying to do everything perfectly; going through the processes, narrowing down the list on the basis of the criteria in the legislation, trying to achieve gender balance and giving everyone a fair opportunity.  Canvassing would virtually result in a candidate being eliminated.  There is a gaping difference between how, on the one hand, the Minister is putting his people on the board and how, on the other, the committee is behaving.  It is only nominating candidates for the Minister to choose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">I commend the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, on being willing to do things differently, but I am not sure we have got it right yet.  Perhaps when the Bill advances to Committee Stage we can have a detailed debate on how we put the boards together and select them and how that process works, learning from the lessons of the process that is being adopted and the successes and potential failures we are currently experiencing with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  We will have time to do it because, realistically, the legislation will not be in place until well into the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">What is being attempted is to have one board member nominated by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and one by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The staff, as is correct, will have a nominee, the Minister will nominate three and then the committee will go through a long process to ensure that it is seen to be getting it right and that it is done in a fair and transparent way to make its three suggestions.  I have made the case many times that I would be happier with a system that would require all of the ministerial and staff nominees to come before an Oireachtas committee and that it would have the right of approval rather than trying to find candidates.  The role of an Oireachtas committee is to hold the Minister and the Government to account, to test the systems and ensure that they are robust.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">To be frank, it is the role of the Minister to make those choices, not to give away that power to a committee.  We have differences of opinion on the issue but my role as an Opposition spokesperson is to ensure that the decisions the Minister makes are the correct ones based on the right criteria.  That is why I prefer the concept of the committee having a vetting role rather than asking the committee to give three names.  We could have a hearing system that would approve the choice of Ministers and in this case the staff to ensure that there is an appropriate balance on the board.  Instead, what we have is six board members being selected in the old way, which needs to change, and three people going through an intensive process in the manner I have outlined.  There is something wrong with that.  Everyone appointed to the board should go through approximately the same process, with the exception perhaps of the staff nominee in terms of his or her background, qualifications and what he or she has to offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">I welcome the arrival of the Bill in the House.  I thank the Minister's officials who took the time to give a personal briefing on it.  The legislation is substantial even though its purpose is straightforward and simple.  The Bill consists of 94 pages, which is a lot.  I accept it takes time but the long time the Bill has taken reflects the priority it had within Government.  I do not accept that the genesis of the Bill only dates back to last year's budget when the Minister announced a rationalisation of quangos programme.  The Bill was promised five years ago.  It is in the House now and we will work with it.  I support its main principle but I hope the Minister and his officials will take on board some of the concerns I have expressed.</p>

        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_1032">When I was preparing for this debate I came across an old briefing from the Department outlining the timeframe for the legislation.  It set out that the heads of the Bill would be finalised by 2 November 2008.  After consultation, the Bill was to be drafted by April 2009.  It was to be enacted and commenced by July and vesting day for the new company was to be 1 August 2009.  That is telling in terms of how we have veered off the estimated timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">Yet again, we had the farcical situation whereby as a result of the delay an order had to be made to postpone the elections to the regional fisheries boards.  That is the fifth time for that to happen.  In 2005, the then Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, made an order.  In 2006, the then Minister of State, Deputy Browne, made an order.  In 2007, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made an order.  In 2008, it was the then Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power.  Now we are being asked to go around the roundabout again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">One could argue that I am labouring the point, but it is important to remember that this is set against a background of severe economic recession.  The context in which we are debating the Bill is one where we have got to see restructuring and rationalisation of the plethora of State agencies that have mushroomed during the years of plenty.  If it is going to take this long to do, what is, relatively speaking, a straightforward task of rationalising in this area, it bodes ill for the kind of major restructuring and rationalisation that is required, both from the point of view of the efficiency of Government, but especially to ensure that we get value for money, as we simply cannot afford to keep going the way we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">I wish to underline the unacceptably slow pace of the process.  I would like to know exactly why it has taken so long.  Perhaps the Minister would address that simple question.  In 2005, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, voted against the postponement when he was in Opposition.  He said ensuring that we keep in office the same elected people was a poor start to the process — the process being the making of the new Bill — and on that basis he was opposing the motion.  By 2006, he was getting even more impatient.  He described the postponement as a shocking indictment of the Government's inability to prioritise the environment and wild fish stocks.  He went as far as to call it a cowardly act.  By 2007, he was in Government and signed the order without a whimper.  It would be salutary to know how it has taken so long to get from A to B, particularly when the process essentially had all-party support and even had the blessing of an bord snip nua.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">The restructuring of the fisheries boards is a necessary step to ensure that the inland fisheries sector reaches its full potential.  It is vital that we harness and encourage local expert knowledge, while at the same time providing a coherent overall strategy to help the sector thrive.  We all recognise that there are threats to the sector, and the Minister has outlined them.  The Bill aims to establish a single national inland fisheries board to replace the existing structures.  It will be called inland fisheries Ireland, IFI.  It is proposed the new authority will have strengthened powers in terms of development and implementation of national policy.  Overall, that is sensible.  The Bill also recommends the elimination of the national salmon commission and the eight fisheries co-operative societies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">Our freshwater systems comprise 2% of the area of the State.  I am not sure what the percentage has been over the past week but we must be conscious of the fact that we now have a new landscape in terms of flooding, potential flooding and the frequency of flooding.  That must be reflected in all policy we make.  I recall that when a flood protection scheme for my constituency was being designed, the regional fisheries board was immensely helpful in ensuring that the needs of fishing and angling were taken into account in the design of that project.  That type of relationship will be far more evident in the future as we adapt to climate change.  I note that under section 80 the IFI would be protected, in effect, from liability for any flooding caused by a structure it owns.  It might be a very small thing and it might never arise, but we should scrutinise that section.  We cannot presume that the old ways will continue in the new scenario we now face and of which we have had a little experience in recent weeks.  There will obviously be a role for the IFI in the development of a national adaptation plan to deal with the flooding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">The consolidation and better use of resources proposed in the Bill is welcome.  There must be more efficiencies in the sector and a more streamlined approach.  That would be good for both the sector and the Government.  Mr. Colm McCarthy's report pointed out that €30 million of the expenditure on the programme for inland fisheries relates to the central and seven regional fisheries boards.  The merger of these fisheries boards into a single national authority with regional operations was announced in the budget of October 2008 but, as has been said, it was in gestation long before that.  It has been estimated that approximately €300,000 per annum would be saved by reduced board membership.  However, it is important to find out the likely costs of the transitional arrangements and how they might negate the savings.  There is nothing about it in the Bill; it simply states that there will not be any additional costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">This raises the question of how to ensure that we are more streamlined in our approach to agencies such as these.  The Minister referred to the embargo.  I can understand it and do not have a great problem with it.  However, there are dangers in using the very clumsy instrument of natural wastage within this structure, in local authorities or in other bodies through people taking early retirement and so forth, in terms of ensuring that we get the right people into the right posts.  That is my concern.  One can already see at local authority level really good people taking early retirement, particularly ahead of the budget.  They are afraid of what might be in the budget.  Their jobs are being spread among other people, which might make sense but it is a pretty arbitrary way to manage human resources within these organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">The high number of board members has been raised.  There are representatives among the board members who have an important role to play and we must recognise that.  I do not argue with the fact that the nature of the boards has become unwieldy and the current structures require restructuring.  The Farrell Grant Sparks review made it clear that comprehensive restructuring was required.  Work has been done since 2004 on how that restructuring should be designed, and now the Bill has been produced.  It provides that the existing boards are to be replaced by a single national inland fisheries authority.  That is good from the point of view of both conservation and development.  There will be nine people on the board and they will mainly be ministerial appointees.  Three members are to be appointed following consultation with the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">Deputy Simon Coveney eloquently made a point about the experiences we have had.  I was spokesperson on health when the HSE was being established.  At the time, I described my concern that we were replacing one monster with another.  Frankly, that is what we got, the old structure of the health boards overlaid by the new structure of the HSE.  It is quite dysfunctional and has been a great disappointment to people.  Most importantly, it has denied local people the type of representation they had at health board level.  Even the experts who were brought in to advise on the restructuring pointed out that there had to be a voice for local people.  The Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, simply disregarded that call.  In an area involving angling and fisheries local knowledge is of major significance and importance.  It is a pity the arrangements that will be made for an advisory forum are not set out in the Bill.  The legislation is a little vague on the matter and we must acknowledge, in some statutory way beyond what is in the Bill, the importance of local accountability and knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">With regard to the system for making appointments, the Bill states that the appointees must have experience of or shown capacity in one or more of the areas of agriculture, aquaculture, business and commercial affairs, commercial fishing, environmental biodiversity matters, fish processing, legal or regulatory affairs, matters pertaining to disability, repairing and ownership of fisheries, recreational fisheries, regional development and tourism.  The same type of specific provision is contained in the Broadcasting Act.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, does not do what the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, did when making his appointments to the new broadcasting authority.  Essentially, he appointed people who had been on the old authority to the new one.  However, in my view he did not comply with the law.  The law is very specific that the appointees of the Minister must comply with the requirements of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">Due to the elaborate process in which the committee is engaged, we wrote to the Minister asking him what boxes were ticked by his appointees.  He either would not or could not tell us.  I suspect he could not because they did not tick any.  However, he fudged his answer, which puts the committee in a difficult position.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, or other Ministers make their appointments they should put an effort into making sure they comply with the law.  For law-makers that should be a self-evident requirement, yet in the case of the broadcasting legislation it did not happen.  That is a lesson that must be learned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">A number of anglers and organisations have expressed concern that local knowledge, information and accountability might be lost.  What about the role of the anglers and will they be represented on the board?  The Bill does not seem to preclude angling interests from having a representative, but we must examine this concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">Concerns have also been expressed about the forum.  It is important, in that its job is to advise and assist Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, in all technical and scientific matters.  However, people are concerned about its nature in terms of regional representation and accountability.  According to the Minister of State, he will develop the terms of reference.  I hope he will do so in an open manner.  Anglers view themselves as conservators and protectors of local resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">I welcome the proposed standing scientific committee, but there must be a guarantee of engagement with the sector's practitioners.  Grant aid poses an issue, as the co-operative development societies will be gone and the new development groups will be administered by the authority.  People are concerned that there will be no grants and that funding will not be there when they look for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">I wish to raise two minor points, the first being the hoary old chestnut of the CEO, when appearing before a committee, not commenting on Government policy.  This provision is framed in the Bill as though it were an edict from God, but that is not the case.  Rather, it has been inserted to protect the Government.  From time to time, a CEO may need to advise the Oireachtas that a Government policy made in good faith has not worked and must be addressed as a matter of importance of which the Oireachtas needs to be aware.  However, CEOs cannot do this because of the muzzling effect of all legislation on board CEOs.</p>

          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_1049">It is peculiar.  Essentially, it means that the Government does not trust a CEO.  We should grow up.  When one considers how openness can lead to a fresher approach to governance, one should have a certain amount of confidence in oneself and in the people one appoints.  Deputy Coveney made a valid point on the type of person who has come forward as a result of advertising for participation in the broadcasting authority's structures.  People want to serve and do their best for their country.  A CEO appointed to the board under discussion is bound to be someone who will ensure that the best job is done.  Otherwise, he or she should not be paid as much as many CEOs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">There must be freedom to advise an Oireachtas committee when something is not working.  In a private company, a CEO would be in deep trouble if he or she did not advise his or her board as to what was not working.  An Oireachtas committee is not a board, but its authority should be recognised.  The muzzling provision means that the Government does not trust the CEO or the committee, which is an old-fashioned view.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">My final issue is a difficult one and I do not mean to point the finger, but a property in Glasnevin was vacated for health and safety reasons and was to be included in a social housing scheme by Dublin City Council.  We do not seem to provide social housing anymore, even though the need for it is increasing.  We must examine this matter to determine what can be done to ensure that the asset in question is realised for public good in some way if it is not to be used as social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">I commend the Minister of State and his civil servants for their work in producing this Bill.  I hope he will have an open mind to amendments, although I do not envisage that there will be many.  I also hope there will be no undue delay, as we have had enough of that.  We must have a streamlined structure that is more efficient and cost effective and maintains the best of the old structures, namely, local accountability and the connections comprising a sophisticated network of conveying information that has developed over a long period.  I hope the Minister of State is in a position to do this.  If so, a good day's work will have been done.</p>

          <p eId="para_1062">After many years of gestation, the Bill is before the House and I welcome the opportunity to speak on it.  That there would be a new definition of how the boards are run is important.  In 1990, I heard with great shock that four officers from the south western fisheries board had been killed in an accident in Ballycotton.  I remember thinking what an appalling event it was.  At the time, I was involved in life on the Barrow.  I have never forgotten their deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">I am closely allied with many members of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board in my area, great rivermen who know the river intimately, patrol their stretches and know exactly what is going on.  They can tell when the salmon or trout are running, what types of coarse fish are in the river and what types of alien species are growing in our rivers.  They know about the lack of stocks in terms of the disappearance of the eels and insect larvae and the declining biodiversity.  If one lives near a river and walks it daily, one becomes not only in tune with its wildlife and biodiversity, but with the colour of its waters, the flow of the river and what weirs do.  For example, weirs have an important function in holding back waters in floods.  The structure of the rivers should be protected by the new Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">The proposal to create a single national inland fisheries body is welcome to myself and others in the House and will provide for a more efficient and effective management of fisheries policy and more coherent policy formulation and will allow for the alignment of regional operations of local authorities with river basin districts.  I am pleased that there will be a national inland fisheries forum and a standing scientific committee to provide scientific expertise for policy makers, whether it be in stock levels for conservation decisions or pollution monitoring for environmental protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">I warmly welcome the decision of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to continue with his approach towards appointments to State boards and the Bill's provision for three of the nine members of the new authority to be chosen by the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, did this successfully in the case of the new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and I commend him for doing it again.  This type of approach is the beginning of political reform in the way in which State appointments are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The new body, Inland Fisheries Ireland, will face many challenges as it tries to look after the interests of everyone who uses our rivers.  I refer, for example, to those involved in various types of fishing, such as snap net fishing, inshore drift fishing and eel fishing, which is about to be confined to protection measures.  The body will also have a role in protecting our weirs and taking measures against pollution.  I am glad that section 80 of the Bill relates to the effects of the flooding of rivers, and the streams that flow into our rivers, on biodiversity.  We have seen in recent days that rivers and streams can have a decisive impact on flood waters.  I am pleased that section 69 of the Bill allows the Minister to prohibit the use of certain nets on rivers.  I have often come across stake nets that have been flung across rivers like the Barrow, the Nore and the Slaney.  We know that anyone who uses a stake net is up to no good.  I would like more patrolling of our rivers and an end to insidious poaching.  At weekends, when I walk my dogs along the banks of the River Barrow at night, I often see people using headlights to help them catch fish.  That is absolutely to be discouraged.  Anyone who fishes by night should not be doing that.  We should compliment the private water keepers from the clubs who do a marvellous job to keep an eye out for activities like stake net fishing and poaching on our rivers.  I urge those with agricultural interests along our rivers to make sure they maintain the water quality to a pristine level, in the interests of the survival of coarse fish and prime species like salmon and trout.  I notice that various species of birds, such as egrets, are migrating from Africa to our rivers as a result of climate change.  I have a keen interest in the biodiversity of our rivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">I welcome this legislation, which is long overdue.  I look forward to seeing the new inland fisheries board in operation.  It will not work on behalf of any particular group, but for everybody who has a love of the river.  I refer to those who walk along the riverbank, fish in the river and row on the river, as well as all the stakeholders in fishing, such as anglers and coarse fishermen.  We have a duty to look after our priceless aquatic environment.  I am glad there are plenty of provisions in this Bill to ensure that the riverine environment, which many of us live near and love deeply, is protected from the worst aspects of modern life.  I refer to the mistakes of local authorities, the actions of industry and the river pollution incidents associated with agriculture.  We have to make sure our waters are pristine and uphold the biodiversity of our rivers.  The sustainable future for inland fishing involves the development of tourism.  When I served on the Barrow catchment committee, someone said to me that every salmon that is caught can be worth up to €1,700 to the local economy.  When a tourist catches a salmon, he or she is likely to go to the pub that night to talk about how big it was.  Even if he or she does not catch it, everyone will hear about the one that got away.  Those who spend the day, or a couple of days, fishing are likely to spend money in local communities at night.  I hope stocks will recover so that our rivers will be full of fish again and we will no longer need the ban on salmon and trout fishing that is currently in force.  Tourism in this area should be sustainable, in the sense that it should respect the environment.  Anglers should respect fish stocks and the countryside surrounding our rivers.  We need to protect the great rivers in Carlow-Kilkenny, which is one of the finest riverine constituencies in Ireland, not for our sake or for the sake of any one stakeholder, but for the sake of future generations.  The future of our rivers will be secured if we provide for responsible management and leadership.  The Bill before the House will facilitate that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1068">Our fish stocks are in danger.  There is an onus on this Parliament to modernise the legislation under which our rivers, which constitute an incredible natural resource, are patrolled and protected.  We need to ensure that fish stocks are available for future generations.  I said earlier that extinction is forever.  Some of the measures that have been introduced in recent years have been criticised.  I refer to the end of drift netting, for example, or the introduction of a moratorium on fishing for eels.  Such controversial measures were introduced with worthy goals in mind — to allow fish stocks to recover, to protect part of the our biosphere and to maintain fish resources for future generations.  One of the saddest aspects of the reduction of fish stocks in recent years has been the manner in which various countries have blamed each other.  On this side of the Atlantic, we tend to blame the Canadians and the Americans, or even the Spanish, for the extinction of fish stocks.  If one goes to Spain or Canada, however, one will hear people blaming Irish and Scottish fishermen, among others.  We have to realise that many fish species are in danger of extinction or are at historically low levels.  We need to do something about that in our oceans and rivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">There is a strong and compelling argument for the amalgamation of the various regional fisheries boards, which employ more than 400 people.  We should ensure that certain economies of scale apply.  I do not doubt that, as the explanatory memorandum suggests, savings will be achieved and existing resources will be better used as a result of this legislation.  I am heartened by that because it is good to do more with less in these difficult economic times.  I give credit to the members of the regional fisheries boards who have had the difficult task of policing our rivers over many years.  They have encountered threats in many instances and violence in some cases.  Many of those who engage in the front-line policing of our rivers have a difficult task.  They have responded well to the threats and other problems they have encountered over the years.  The protection of our watercourses is a multifaceted task.  We need to consider the role of bodies like the Environmental Protection Agency and Teagasc in applying the EU policy document known as the nitrates directive.  It has been far too easy to attribute the blame for difficulties in farming and other sectors on laws that have been decreed in Brussels and to suggest that the EU has no understanding of the challenges faced by farmers and others.  If we do not control the use of nitrous fertilisers on our farms, we will end up polluting our watercourses, which will have a direct impact on the number of fish in our rivers.  There is a compelling need to control the kind of pollutants that tend to end up in our rivers and to place a strong obligation on farmers to practice good farm management.  The EPA should be also subject to strong obligations.  Industrial premises have been polluting our rivers for far too long.  They have used various techniques and tricks, such as the discharge of pollutants during night-time hours or the use of holding tanks to wait for what the industry might see as the right time for such discharge.  As that has a dramatic impact on our watercourses, we need to control it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">I alluded to planning, which is another area about which we need to think carefully, during this evening's debate on climate change.  We have to realise that the use of septic tanks leads to the pollution of watercourses in the case of a significant percentage of Irish soils.  Such pollutants can therefore drain directly into our rivers and cause fish kills.  This complex problem cannot be solved if industrial, agricultural and domestic discharges, including discharges from septic tanks, are not controlled.  If, however, we can put the right kind of controls in these areas that will allow people to live where they should live, which in many cases is in the countryside, allow jobs to be created in our industries without causing contamination and allow our farms produce good, sustainable local produce, we will be able to do all of that and still protect our fish life.  There is a great onus on the new body, inland fisheries Ireland, to control all of this and liaise with the other State agencies, whether Teagasc, the EPA or local authorities that have significant responsibilities with regard to municipal sewage treatment works.  If we can control all of this, we will be able to create many jobs in fishing and sustain many more people in the countryside.  It can be a win-win situation for all bodies involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">I commend my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, on introducing the legislation to the House.  A great deal of it will have to be teased out in detail on Committee Stage but I have no doubt there is a commitment on all sides to improving the water quality of our rivers and their fish stocks and to bringing sustainable employment to our rural areas and on our rivers.  That will produce an Ireland of which we can all be proud.</p>

          <p eId="para_1073">It has taken us many years to get to the point where legislation related to the nation's freshwater resources is being introduced by the Government.  The primary focus of the proposed Bill is on the problem of structure in the sector.  In my view, it is an integrated solution with emphasis on freshwater fish but completely misses the big picture.  National freshwater resources have not suffered from a lack of studies, reviews and reports over the years.  Many of these studies and reviews in the inland fisheries sector were initiated in response to perceived problems with institutional arrangements such as regionalised management structures, strong involvement of local interests in decision making, complex issues of ownership, reliance on State funding and tensions between different stakeholders.  Studies and reviews were also initiated in response to concerns of over-exploitation of fish stocks and threats to fish habitats from a variety of adverse environmental and water quality pressures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">I know that, having been involved with the ban on fishing and drift netting which was very commendable at the time.  The ban on nets was very much welcomed and the conservation of salmon stocks was very much appreciated for the future.  When one looks at the budget of €20 million for inland fisheries over the years, one sees that almost 95% was spent on administration.  This area has been starved of money in many ways for years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">However, many of these studies and reviews looked only at selected aspects or at particular dimensions.  Most of the reports encountered difficulty with regard to implementation of significant change because in many cases the different stakeholder interests in the sector are in conflict with one another and, in some instances, are mutually exclusive.  Recognising the need for change in the sector, in 2003 the Department commissioned independent consultants to undertake a detailed examination of the State's role and objectives in the inland fisheries sector.  The aim was to evaluate the adequacy of the current model for the governance of the sector and to recommend a structure that would contribute to the optimum development of the inland fisheries resource in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">The terms of reference for the 2003 study were wide ranging.  The emphasis was to review the development issues in the sector, including the model for governance of the sector, funding arrangements, sector conservation and development, institutional arrangements, including roles and relationships, performance indicators, etc.  The terms of reference also required the consultants to factor into their thinking the implementation of the EU water framework directive and the national spatial strategy with respect to the integration of inland fisheries considerations into land use planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">This is very important when one considers the massive flooding at the moment, namely, land use flooding.  That was the remit of the Farrell, Grant and Sparks report.  One sees the devastation in all the counties on the news every evening where land plains were developed and rezoned for planning, including the massive building in Carrick-on-Shannon.  It is like Venice there at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">According to the consultants' report, it is clear the intention of the Minister of State and his Department was to commission a holistic, root and branch review of the sector which would lead to fundamental change and that there would be new thinking and innovative approaches in the future.  However, this entire review exercise has been a disaster from the start.  The consultants' report sat on the desk of the former Minister for the Marine for six months before it was finally published to widespread condemnation in November 2005.  Strong stakeholder and industry resistance to the proposals were clearly evident from the beginning and there was little or no willingness to participate in consultations on the actions required to deliver the recommendations of the report.  Those were two elements of the Farrell, Grant and Sparks report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">A period of confusion followed, with the development of alternative restructuring proposals to be considered by the Minister of State.  These considerations came to an abrupt end with the current Government policy to rationalise State agencies, in particular, the budget day announcement in October 2008 that the existing central and regional fisheries boards were to be replaced by a single national authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">After a review initiated in 2003, a report published in 2005 and four wasted years later, we are now back to a Government Bill that effectively implements the 2005 consultants' report.  The Minister of State referred to the Department's overall policy of responsibility for conservation management, regulation and development of the inland fisheries sector, assisted in its mission by the central and regional fisheries boards, other agencies and the Marine Institute.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">I have visited that institute and know it as a very fine development.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate what its role in this body will be because it has a significant research facility.  It is mentioned only in a small way.  I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on the role of the Marine Institute, the locks agency, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the ESB.  Perhaps he might get clarification from the ESB and come back to the House with it.  He said that organisation has an important role in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">The concerns on the Shannon at present are with the operation of the locks and the water levels.  There are so many different agencies involved, the Nationals Parks and Wildlife Service, SSE, HEA and all the different authorities.  Very many people deal with this area.  Will the ESB have an involvement in the new forum that is now to be established?  The Minister of State referred to North-South correlations.  These will be beneficial in implementing the EU-sponsored measures in this sector.  The Minister might elaborate on what he plans with the North-South development.  There is a cross-Border institutional body dealing with this too.  What plans has he got and what are the possibilities?</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">There are 150 members at present and the Minister of State plans to reduce that to nine, a considerable reduction.  How will those numbers reflect the interests of the country and the opportunities for development?  He stated that stakeholder involvement is vital at local level but must be properly structured and channelled to ensure that input from diverse and sometimes competing stakeholders can be utilised to best effect.  He might indicate how that can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">One part of the Bill that I wholeheartedly welcome is the section that provides for inland fisheries Ireland to establish and manage a national inland fisheries forum.  However, neither the Bill nor the Minister of State's press release provide any indication of the composition and terms of reference for the proposed forum.  I ask the Minister to come back to the House on that point.  I have long advocated a stronger role for stakeholders in the inland and marine sectors.  Concerning tourism, Deputy Simon Coveney correctly stated the potential for development of the rivers must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">I want to see a situation where fishermen, conservationists and all the stakeholders with a genuine interest in the sector are involved.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1086">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">The number on the live register in County Kerry has increased by over 100% since December 2007.  Between then and October 2009, the number on the live register increased from 7,288 to 15,106.  In December 2007, there were 3,249 people on the live register in Tralee but this has now increased to 6,269 according to the figures released for October.  The increase is due to the decline in the construction industry in the county, in respect of which there has been a reduction in employment from 11,500 in 2006 to 5,125 in 2009.  This is a major blow.  However, it is also due to the loss of jobs in the manufacturing sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">In recent years, Tralee has lost most of its manufacturing industrial base, including Denny, Amann, Glen Dimplex, Kleinhuis and Ridgeview.  Apart from the development by Shannon Development of Kerry Technology Park, which opened in 2001 and which now supports over 300 well-paid jobs, very few industrial jobs have been created in Tralee, either by IDA Ireland or more recently by Enterprise Ireland since it took over from Shannon Development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">The announcement on Wednesday, 11 November by the management of BERU Electronics that it may have to shed up to 80 jobs came as a major disappointment and a further blow to the local economy.  Management at the company confirmed on 11 November that it will reduce its workforce at the Tralee-based operation.  The proposal forms part of an overall reorganisation by the group to ensure ongoing competitiveness in line with global economic conditions and the serious downturn in the worldwide automotive industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">The company said in its press release that it intended to enter consultation with staff to protect the employment of approximately 120 people at its Tralee plant, where 200 are currently employed, and that the reorganisation may involve some 80 redundancies among the workforce.  It stated also the redundancies would be in order to avoid possible closure of the facility, which is currently loss-making.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">The management stressed in its press release that the company remains committed to its operations in Tralee, where it has been located since 1985.  The initiative it proposes is designed to bring costs into line with overall economic conditions and to return the Tralee-based facility to profitability based on current and future expected sales volumes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">In the press statement, the plant manager, Mr. Paddy Lange, said the company must address the over-capacity that exists in the company's international production facilities.  He stated that while this has already involved plant closures in places such as Italy, Hungary, Mexico and Korea, and job losses in other countries, the company is hopeful of sustaining and securing the future of its long-standing operations in Tralee as market conditions improve.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to convey to the Minister that it is very important that IDA Ireland and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment provide every support possible to the company to help it survive.  I welcome the fact that the Department has approved the employment subsidy scheme for the company.  This will no doubt help.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">I call on IDA Ireland, through the Minister, to try to provide resources to the company to help it research and develop further products.  It is critical that the company look to other areas in the automotive industry in order to create further jobs and possibilities.  I hope new opportunities arise on foot on an upturn in the industry globally.  I hope the Minister of State has a very positive response.  Tralee and Kerry as a whole have been devastated by job losses.  We must create new jobs, which is very difficult, and at least protect the existing ones.</p>

            <p eId="para_1095">IDA Ireland was informed on Wednesday, 11 November 2009 that BERU was announcing the impact of the decision made in June 2009 by BERU Group to transfer the quick-start glow plug line from Tralee to Germany.  An announcement was made that afternoon to all staff updating them on the future of the Tralee plant, which will include the likely loss of up to 80 employees at the plant and the timing of the transfer, which is scheduled for February next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">BERU Manufacturing GmbH was established in Tralee in 1986 by BERU AG, Ludwigsburg, Germany.  BERU is now 100% owned by Borg Warner Incorporated, Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States, which purchased a controlling 60% stake in BERU in 2005 and purchased the remaining share in May 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">BERU was founded in 1912 and it is one of the leading manufacturers of diesel cold-start systems with an estimated world-wide market share of 40% for glow plugs.  In the field of ignition technology for petrol engines, BERU is one of the four major manufacturers in Europe.  The electronics and sensors division provides focuses on electronic systems solutions for the automotive industry.  The company also produces sensor technology and ignition systems for the oil and gas burner industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">IDA Ireland approved assistance towards the start-up of the operation in 1986 and a major expansion of the plant in 1999.  Employment grew to a peak of 300 people in 2000 and the company currently employs 204 in the manufacture of diesel glow plugs and electronic sensors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">BERU is suffering badly in the current automotive industry downturn.  Since the end of 2007, the company has been focusing on reducing costs.  It released its results for the period January 2009 to March 2009 on 14 May 2009 and they showed a decline in first-quarter revenues of 38% and a decline in earnings before interest and taxes of 73%.  Employment in the group reduced from 2,461 in the first quarter of 2008 to 1,898 currently.  The group has closed plants in Hungary and Italy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">In line with the company's cost cutting, the Tralee plant has had to make significant progress in respect of lean implementation and process improvements to strengthen engineering capability.  In April 2009, the Tralee plant announced 20 job losses but a visit by the BERU CEO in January confirmed the group's commitment to the plant.  However, following the deterioration in revenues and earnings, the group reviewed its production operations which lead to the recent decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">IDA Ireland is working closely with the company to secure new investments and to protect the remaining 120 jobs.  The locations that IDA Ireland is focusing on in Kerry are the national spatial strategy-linked hub locations of Killarney in south Kerry and Tralee in north Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">IDA Ireland's strategy for County Kerry is to work with local authorities and relevant infrastructure and service providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the region; to progress the development of a knowledge economy so that the region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment; to work with the existing IDA client base and to help it to further develop its presence; and to provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">The recognition under the national spatial strategy of the importance of Killarney and Tralee as linked hubs will assist IDA Ireland in promoting the region for inward investment.  It will also assist in the development of the necessary critical mass needed in terms of population, skills and infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">Kerry has traditionally been a centre of manufacturing for foreign direct investment.  However, over recent years it has proved challenging to maintain and attract overseas manufacturing companies into the county as much of this investment globally is going to low-cost destinations such as eastern and central Europe and China.  As a result of this location shift in global manufacturing, Kerry has seen a number of closures within the multinational sector.  At the end of 2008, there were 15 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Kerry employing approximately 1,798 permanent staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">IDA Ireland promotes Kerry as part of an integrated region with access to the county population base of 139,616 in addition to the expanded population of both the mid-west and south-west regions with a combined population of 935,039.  Based on the strengths of the region, IDA Ireland is particularly targeting the ICT sector, including the software sector, and the international financial services and globally traded business sectors.  To support this strategy, IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the region in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county.  The IDA is also working with FÁS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">It continues to market all available land and buildings in the county including its 12 acre business and technology park at Tiemaboul, Killarney, County Kerry.  In Tralee, the IDA is also marketing the Kerry Technology Park which is owned and managed by Shannon Development in partnership with the Institute of Technology Tralee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, the IDA continues to work closely with its existing clients in Kerry to encourage them to expand their operations in the county.  An example of this is the recent announcement in September 2008 by Aetna that it is to expand its existing operation with the addition of 70 jobs in Castleisland.</p>

            <from>Deputy Paul Connaughton</from>
            <p eId="para_1108">The recent monsoon-type rainfalls have created havoc, despair, hardship and bitterness for thousands of families whose homes have flooded.  As we speak in Dáil Éireann tonight, the problem is getting worse in some areas, in particular south Galway, from Clonfert, Melick, Loughrea, Gort and Kinvara, while parts of Ballinasloe town, after what happened last week, would remind one of a war zone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">The misery visited on families in Abbeyknockmoy and Ballinastack, together with a vast number of other families who had to walk, crawl or be rescued from their houses had to be seen to be believed.  I have seen first hand several of these areas and it is difficult for the families concerned to make decisions about their future, given the enormous difficulties they are currently experiencing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">There are countless other people who have been left penniless by the floods.  Many farmers' land is under water and many of them have had to rescue their stock from slatted houses.  Many farmers have outsourced their stock to kindly neighbours who are now looking after them.  Many business people are financially ruined because stock is rotting away and is totally useless.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">Last Saturday morning in the frost, fog and bitter cold, I saw heroic work being done by neighbours, county council staff, IFA leaders, HSE officials, the Order of Malta, the clergy and many others in an effort to try to save the Emmanuel House of Prayer and four or five nearby houses in Clonfert.  So great was the force of the flood which backed up from the Shannon that, despite the best efforts of the numerous tankers which removed thousands of gallons of water from each garden, it was obvious that the fight was being lost.  Several families had to evacuate later on that day as the water ran through their houses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">Realistic humanitarian aid must be made available quickly.  Many families have received small amounts of compensation from community welfare officers to buy provisions such as food, blankets and other necessities of life.  However, several householders who have been denied insurance cover because of previous flood compensation settlements are now standing in the worst possible position in the world.  Their houses and their contents are destroyed, they have no insurance cover and, which is worse, will never be able to sell their houses.  This is where humanitarian aid is most needed and is needed quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">Many other families who have insurance but who will not have their claims processed for weeks or months need humanitarian aid to tide them over.  Farmers who have lost valuable stock and winter feed and whose machinery has been damaged need financial aid quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1114">When will the guidelines for the compensation scheme be announced?  Will there be a means test for qualification?  Who will assess the damage?  When will the cheques be paid?</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">No other flood since 1954, and long before that, have caused such havoc and destruction.  The long-term answer to a problem which has been getting worse in recent years must surely be better management of the River Shannon.  No debris, soil, silt or trees have been removed from the Shannon or its tributaries, such as the Suck, for 25 years.  There are banks of mud and debris which now look like islands in the middle of the Shannon and this material must be removed over the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">The ESB must play a different role in river flows given the increased torrent of rain which now falls.  The attitude towards the management of the Shannon and its tributaries must change from a "cannot do" to a "must do" scenario.  It does not take a scientist or an engineer to identify that the quicker inland water can be moved to the sea the less likely flooding will take place upstream.  The various stakeholders who steadfastly hold on to their piece of the cake will now have to come together to seek a solution quickly or floods on the Shannon in years to come will make what happened this year seem like a picnic.  If it is any worse than this year, it will be an outrageous disaster.</p>

            <p eId="para_1117">The Government recognises the devastation suffered by people in many areas as a result of the recent floods.  Community welfare service staff throughout the country have been providing huge support to families every day since the flooding occurred.  They have already provided emergency financial and other assistance to households affected by the flooding to cover items such as clothing, food, bedding, heating, hire of dehumidifiers and emergency accommodation needs.  Community welfare officers have made more than 470 initial emergency payments to people in areas impacted by flooding, including 200 payments made in Cork.  The average payment made was €300.  Officers will continue to make these payments as long as there is a requirement to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118">In addition to this, a humanitarian assistance scheme is being set up to provide means tested financial support to people who have suffered damage to their homes.  An initial sum of €10 million has been set aside by the Government for this purpose.  As the flood waters abate and people assess the full extent of the damage to their homes, qualified households can claim for essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods.  Assistance will also be available for structural repairs to homes not covered by household insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">Humanitarian assistance is not an alternative to insurance in cases where household insurance was available on a reasonable basis.  However, where insurance cover is not available because of previous flooding claims, a person may claim humanitarian assistance.  All of the main insurance companies have 24 hour, seven day a week dedicated phone help lines in place to assist people to make claims under their household insurance policies.  Depending on the nature of the insurance policy held, some companies may make advance payments to help people replace their most important belongings immediately.  Insurance companies have undertaken to process claims as quickly as possible.  The costs of medical treatment and supplies may also be considered in determining assistance where medical cover is not already in place through private health insurance or medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">The level of payment available under the aid scheme to any qualified individual will depend on the severity of the damage to that person's home and the extent of the loss experienced, as well as household income and general family circumstances.  The scheme will provide hardship alleviation as opposed to full compensation.  As on previous occasions, commercial or business losses will not be covered by the scheme nor will losses which are covered by household insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">Applications under the scheme will be means tested to ensure that available assistance will be prioritised for those who are most vulnerable.  It will not cover damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation, though humanitarian assistance may be considered in the case of a tenant's personal belongings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">The basic principle of the means test will be to determine the household's capacity to meet the costs of restoring the home to a habitable condition.  All household income will be considered when determining entitlement to a payment.  However, account will be taken of outgoings such as rent or mortgage payments, other loans and travel to work costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">In addition to the means test, other factors will also be considered by the community welfare service in assessing individual applications, including whether the applicant is or was homeless as a result of the flooding, the age profile of family members, including babies, young children or elderly persons, the availability of support from the wider family and the special needs that people may have as a result of illness or disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">People seeking assistance should contact their local community welfare office.  Further information and applications forms in regard to the humanitarian assistance scheme are available from the community welfare service in the affected areas and from the Department's website, <i>www.welfare.ie</i>, and the HSE’s website,<i> www.hse.ie</i>.  While this scheme is not intended to provide full compensation for all losses and damage it will go towards alleviating the hardship which many hundreds of families have had to endure.</p>

          <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_301">
            <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_1125">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to discuss this important issue, namely, the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to establish a River Shannon authority on a statutory basis to take overall control of river management and development in the Shannon catchment and navigation areas, with its prime function being flood protection and alleviation and land drainage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">As householders, farmers and business owners in counties adjoining the Shannon face immeasurable hardship due to unprecedented flooding, the long overdue River Shannon authority which was promised by Fianna Fáil Ministers, particularly one in my own area and another in the midlands area, must be put in place as soon as possible.  A River Shannon authority would provide for the overall control of river management and development in the Shannon catchment and Shannon navigation areas from the source of the river to the Shannon Estuary in Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">At present a large number of separate statutory bodies exercise authority over various aspects of river management and a considerable number of private organisations have a direct interest in and beneficial use of the Shannon.  These include 11 local authorities in Fermanagh in Northern Ireland, Longford, Westmeath, Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon, Offaly, Galway, Tipperary, Limerick and Clare, plus other statutory bodies such as the ESB, OPW, Bord na Mona, IDA Ireland, CIE, the fisheries boards, various drainage boards and committees under the auspices of local authorities, Tourism Ireland, at least three regional tourism organisations, a number of environment and enterprise SPCs, the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and Transport, and the Shannon Foynes Port Company etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1128">Voluntary bodies involved with the River Shannon include the IFA, Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, local fishing clubs, local boating clubs, local yachting clubs, sailing clubs, canoe clubs, commercial boat hire companies, Irish Water Safety, Irish Wildbird Conservancy, Irish Wildlife Trust, bird-watching clubs, ICMSA and National Farmers Union in Northern Ireland.  I could go on until morning naming organisations with an involvement in the River Shannon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1129">There is no structure to ensure the co-ordination of the activities of these bodies.  A River Shannon authority would provide such a structure and deal once and for all with the causes and extent of flooding in the Shannon catchment area; the impact of flooding on different sections of society, including farmers, householders, businesses, etc.; and powers to respond to different categories of flooding.  A River Shannon authority would be responsible for the regulatory and river management functions of the water authorities — local authorities and the national rural water monitoring committee — including pollution control and quality regulation of the river with powers to prosecute offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">Such an authority would have control of putting in place a flood alert system as part of a national system to increase awareness of potential river flooding.  It would be responsible for controlling flooding, maintenance works, improving farming and forest practices, and public health.  This authority would be endowed with sufficient powers to instigate measures to deal with pollution and enforce them.  The ineffectiveness of duplicated and overlapping structures could be remedied by the establishment of a single River Shannon authority.  This proposal makes good business sense in terms of efficiency and cost.  A unified authority would carry more weight than the many existing separate authorities in ensuring that necessary legislative measures for the River Shannon management and development are enacted and also for attracting EU funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">Apart from the urgent need to establish a River Shannon authority, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has shamefully refused to draw up planning regulations to prevent the building of houses on flood plains.  What does the Minister do now?  He blames bad planning.  The Minister needs to get a grip on his portfolio.  The double blow to those living in counties adjoining the Shannon, of economic downturn and the repercussions of flood damage, are almost too much to bear.  I have met many of those people.  They are too sad and depressed to even be angry at this stage.  I spent all of Saturday and Sunday throughout the areas of south County Longford that adjoin the Shannon.</p>

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_308" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1138">In recent days we have seen the devastating effects of flooding on homes, businesses, and people's livelihoods in many parts of the country including locations across the River Shannon catchment area.  The entire river basin area has been affected from Leitrim and Roscommon down to Clare and Limerick.  Record water levels were recorded in Loughs Derg, Ree and Allen.  Our thoughts are with all those who have suffered the effects of flooding in recent days.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">In responding to the flooding, the local authorities have been following the procedures set out in the framework for major emergency management.  This framework enabled the three principal response agencies — the Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and local authorities, together with the Defence Forces and other voluntary agencies to co-ordinate their response to the flooding.  Reports from the areas experiencing major flooding show that the interagency response has worked in a satisfactory manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">Future improvements to co-ordinated flood risk management in Ireland will be in accordance with the EU floods directive, which requires the assessment of flood risks and the preparation of flood risk management plans on a river basin basis.  The report of Ireland's flood policy review group, approved by Government in 2004, set out a policy on the management of flood risks which is in line with the requirements of the floods directive.  The report recommended that the OPW should have responsibility for flood risk management.  An interdepartmental co-ordination group has been established to assist in co-ordinating the implementation of the recommendations of the flood policy review group, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is represented on this group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">The OPW will transpose the floods directive into Irish law before the end of the year.  It is envisaged that the OPW will be the competent authority for the directive.  The OPW has already begun the process of procuring a flood risk assessment and management study for the River Shannon catchment area, and the study is expected to be commissioned by mid 2010.  All of the main stakeholders will be consulted including the ESB and relevant local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has lead responsibility for implementation of the EU water framework directive which provides for the protection of our waters.  Local authorities are in the process of finalising river basin management plans.  These plans will detail current water quality, set objectives for maintaining and improving water quality, and set out the measures necessary to achieve these improvements.  The plans are being prepared jointly by the local authorities in each river basin district with funding provided by the Department.  Limerick County Council is the co-ordinating authority for the Shannon river basin district.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">The Department has also worked closely with the OPW to develop comprehensive guidelines to enable local authority planners to contribute substantially to the management of flooding-related issues.  The guidelines, published by the Minister, Deputy Gormley with the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, last Monday are aimed at ensuring a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to incorporate fully flood risk assessment and management into future regional plans, county and city development plans, local area plans and in determining future applications for planning permissions in line with the principles of proper planning and sustainable development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">The Department and the OPW will work closely to co-ordinate future revisions of river basin management plans and flood risk management plans.  These plans will provide a comprehensive and integrated response to the issues raised by the Deputy.</p>

          <heading>Higher Education Grants.</heading>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_309">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_1145">This case concerns a mature student who is now in her late 20s.  She is originally from my constituency and is now in the second year of a degree course in a university outside Dublin.  She started her course in 2008 and applied for a higher education grant to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council as a mature student.  She was refused the grant on the grounds that she did not satisfy the residency requirement.  When she appealed to the Department of Education and Science the decision to refuse the grant was upheld.  I have made repeated representations to the Minister for Education and Science, and to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, but to no avail which is why I am raising the issue here today.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">This woman worked for approximately ten years.  She started to work at 16.  She paid her tax, social insurance, etc.  She never claimed any social welfare payment from the State.  In 2005 she decided to travel.  She worked for a while in China, South East Asia and in Australia.  While she was back home for brief spells at various times during those three years, she returned to Ireland in August 2008 to start her course in the autumn.  She applied for the higher education grant and was informed that she did not satisfy the residency requirement and that she would have needed to have been living in Ireland prior to 1 October 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">There was a glimmer of hope in a letter that I got from the Minister for Education and Science on 14 July which stated that local authorities had the discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances.  I pursued this with the county council and it replied, stating that it did not have discretion.  The letter stated that the council would only have had such discretion if the person concerned had been out of the country for less than one year and because she was out of the country for more than three years, it was not possible for the county council to waive the requirement in her case.  I went back to the Minister on the issue and he replied, stating that he did not have discretion and did not propose to make an exception in this case.  This is ludicrous.  There is a clear contradiction between what the Minister said — that the local authority had discretion — and the local authority's assertion that it did not have discretion.  That is something that can be sorted out by means of a direction from the Minister to the county council, because he is the final arbiter in these cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">The person in this case was born and reared in my constituency and has worked all her life in Ireland.  She went away for a couple of years but she is being treated as though she has just arrived from Mars.  The residency requirement is ludicrous in such a case.  This woman has managed to get through the first year of her course with considerable difficulty.  She is now in her second year and facing a crisis which may force her to withdraw from the course.  If she does this, she will cost the State more, in terms of what she is entitled to claim in social welfare, than the value of the grant.  Alternatively — this is the daftest aspect of the whole situation — having done a year and a half of the course, she would be entitled to start the course again, claim the grant and receive it because she would by then have been resident in Ireland since 1 October of the year before her application.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">I suspect the Minister of State will read out the response I have repeatedly received from the Minister for Education and Science.  I appreciate he must read out the script he has been given.  However, when we have concluded this exchange, I ask him to discuss this with the Minister and ask him to reconsider this case.  Not only is it ludicrous in its own terms and unfair to the young woman concerned, who will suffer hardship as a result, but the way this residence requirement is being applied in student grant cases such as this is quite absurd.  It is unfair that a person who has contributed to the State and the Exchequer through payment of taxes through the years is being treated as though she were an absolute stranger who had never lived here before and had no connection with the country.  The application of the residency requirement in such circumstances is inappropriate.</p>

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_310" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1150">I am replying to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to outline the Department's position on the application by the student in question for funding under the higher education grants scheme.  The Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students: the higher education grants scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.  The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities, while the other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">Under the terms of the maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment.  The residency clause of the scheme requires, in the case of a candidate under the age of 23, that the candidate's parents or guardians have been resident in the administrative area of a local authority from 1 October of the previous year or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, that he or she has been resident in the administrative area of a local authority from the same date.  The local authority has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances.  However, the type of situation in which the residency requirement is waived is, for example, one in which an independent mature candidate has missed the residency requirement by a relatively short period of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1153">The candidate in question had been out of the country for a period of three years and four months and had only been resident in the country from August 2008.  To meet the residency requirement of the scheme, the candidate would need to have been resident in the administrative area of the local authority from October 2007.  In cases in which a candidate has been out of the country for a period of time of more than one year before commencing his or her course, irrespective of whether he or she can produce evidence of independent living prior to going abroad, he or she is not eligible to be considered under the residency clause of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154">In this case, the decision on the candidate's eligibility for a third level grant was a matter for Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  Its initial decision — that the candidate did not satisfy the residency requirement of the higher education grants scheme — was communicated to the candidate on 13 October 2008.  Following an initial appeal of this decision to the local authority, the county council wrote again to the candidate on 29 October 2008 to advise that the decision remained unchanged.  On 28 November 2008, a notice of appeal was received from the candidate by the Department.  The Department responded to the candidate on 15 December 2008, advising that as she did not meet the residency requirement prescribed under the higher education grants scheme for 2008, she was ineligible for financial assistance.  On that basis, the Department upheld the original decision of Dun Laoghaire County Council and its subsequent decision on appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">In publishing the student grant schemes for 2009 and 2010 earlier this year, the Minister for Education and Science gave notice that it is intended to introduce a revised residency requirement of three out of the last five years, with effect from 2010-11, in accordance with the provisions of the Student Support Bill.  This will allow for greater flexibility in meeting the residency requirement.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not open to the Minister, the Department or the assessing authorities to depart from the terms and conditions of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_1158">I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 50 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">As the Deputy will be aware, the Special Group on Public Services and  Expenditure was established to examine current expenditure programmes in each Government Department and to make recommendations to Government for ensuring a return to sustainable public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">The report outlined that of the 3,200 primary schools in the State, approximately 47% had five teachers or fewer.  The report also identified significant cost savings that could be achieved by reducing the overall number of schools through amalgamations and mergers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">The proposals in the report are being considered in the context of the current financial climate.  Decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for the Government.  While I will have to await the outcome of these deliberative processes, I can confirm that there are no plans to undertake an immediate large-scale programme of small school closures at this time.  The exception to this is small schools where the question of closure would arise in the normal course under the current sustainability limits.  These will continue to be dealt with in the same way and such schools may be closed if the numbers reduce over time to an unsustainable level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">However, I am of the view that my Department will have to examine the implementation of more strict guidelines in relation to the number of pupils required for both the commencement and the sustainability of schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">It is within this context that my Department will be examining discreet groups or clusters of small schools and perhaps some individual small schools to see how we might achieve more value for money and a more efficient use of the resources that are currently allocated to these schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">However, in considering any policy changes relating to small schools, my  Department is conscious that there is a wider dimension in addition to the cost of maintaining small schools to be considered.  Among the issues that will need to be taken into account are the impact of school closures on dispersed rural communities, parental choice, the availability of diversity of school provision and the additional cost of school transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">All Patron bodies and the Education Partners will be consulted as part of any initiative undertaken by my Department in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1169">As I stated in my reply to Deputy Hayes today, I have had several meetings with  Protestant representatives, most recently on 21 October, when I met with the Committee on Management for Protestant Schools.  At that meeting, I invited the committee to join a working group with my officials to explore future measures to support their schools.  While I regret that the Committee has declined the invitation, I retain the belief that engagement between them and my officials is the best way to resolve the issues that are of concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">I have repeatedly stated my, and the Government's, commitment to supporting Protestant education.  Indeed, it is in order to deal with the concerns expressed by Archbishop Neill of the effect of the budgetary changes on Protestant schools that I have sought to ensure the direct involvement of those involved in Protestant education in identifying and resolving issues collaboratively.  I wish also to confirm that I fully concur with Archbishop Martin's views on the contribution of Protestant schools to fostering pluralism in Irish education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1171">I would like to emphasise that the Government continues to provide the Block Grant, which was increased this year and amounted to €6.5 million.  It is targeted as a support to individual pupils to enable them to attend Protestant schools.  I would urge the Deputies to take note that it is this grant, and this grant only, which defrays fees for pupils in need, enabling them to attend day or boarding schools as required, in recognition of the dispersed nature of the Protestant community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">However, I am obliged, at all times, to act in accordance with the Constitution.  The Constitution, in article 44, permits state aid to denominational schools, but only on the basis that there be no discrimination between schools under different religious management.  The advice of the Attorney General has been provided on the interpretation of this provision, and I am satisfied that the budget changes are consistent with the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">It is clear, therefore, that a return to the status quo ante is not legally possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1174">However, I would like to restate my commitment to working with the Protestant community to identify and resolve issues that may affect some of their schools, particularly those in rural areas, and to examine how these might be examined in a manner consistent with the Constitution.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1176">Under the terms of my Department's student grant and free fees schemes, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants and free tuition fees where they satisfy the prescribed conditions of the individual schemes, including those relating to progression.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">In general, students who previously pursued a course of study are not eligible for grant assistance or free tuition fees in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant or tuition fees were paid previously.  The main objective of this policy is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one undergraduate degree and in progressing, where appropriate, to a postgraduate course of study.  Subject to the conditions of the individual schemes, free tuition and grants are available where students are progressing to a course at a higher level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">While I have no plans at present to change the current progression requirements of the existing schemes, my Department has been working closely with the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social and Family Affairs to develop appropriate responses to meet the upskilling needs of those who are losing their jobs or facing uncertain employment prospects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">Under the labour market activation scheme, 2,500 part-time undergraduate and postgraduate places have been made available for unemployed people.  Although the Maintenance Grant and Free Fees schemes do not cover part-time courses, students on the scheme are not charged tuition fees and are not required to pay the €1,500 registration fee.  Postgraduate students may be required to pay a small charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">Participants are also entitled to retain social welfare payments to which they have an underlying entitlement.  The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and therefore, their prospects of returning to the workforce.  Eligibility for the Back to Education Allowance and associated payments is determined and administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">The Government is anxious to continue to ensure a co-ordinated approach to optimise the opportunities for both school leavers and mature students to engage in education and training and will keep the existing arrangements under review. The scope to develop further responses is being considered in the context of ongoing discussions with other Government Departments on developing appropriate upskilling, training and education responses for unemployed people.</p>

            <p eId="para_1183">My Department acknowledges that some students are experiencing delays in the processing of their grant applications.  It is understood that both local authorities and VECs, the awarding bodies for student grants, received an unprecedented number of student grant applications this year with increases in applications up by 30% in some areas. In some instances, late applications are still being received.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">Both VECs and local authorities are experiencing pressures due to the increased workload associated with the increased demand for the schemes, particularly in the context of the recruitment moratorium in the public sector which, in some instances, is affecting the processing of grants.  However, every effort is being made by these bodies to ensure that students get decisions on their grant applications and are paid as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">The current difficult economic circumstances have necessitated tough choices to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  This includes the need to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector.  It is inevitable that staffing constraints on public bodies will lead to certain pressures on services.  However, these bodies, even in these challenging circumstances, are endeavouring to ensure that the work associated with the processing of grants is prioritised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">Apart from the pressures associated with the volume of applications, a significant number of outstanding grant applications have not been processed in full because the applications were incomplete.  I would remind students and their parents to return all necessary supporting documentation as early as possible to help the awarding bodies make prompt decisions on entitlement.  I have asked the Higher Education Authority to request institutions to be flexible in respect of the payment of the student services charge for those still awaiting a decision on their grant application.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">I am assessing organisational options for the processing of grant applications in the longer run with a view to streamlining operations and achieving more effective administrative efficiencies.  Possible options for a more significant aggregation of functions are now being explored in the context of budgetary considerations and the Government's overall programme of public service reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">In the interim, my Department is working closely with local authorities and  VECs on a number of initiatives, some of which are already leading to administrative efficiencies and alleviating some of the pressures on awarding authorities.  These initiatives, which will also enhance the level of service to students, include the provision of advance payments for student grants to all awarding authorities, migration of grant payments directly to students on a phased basis by way of electronic funds transfer and improvements to the grant application process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1190">My Department is considering a number of broad policy issues relating to the recognition process for second level schools and the application from Educate Together to be recognised as a patron body at second level is being fully examined within the context of the relevant legal, financial and other factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1191">In recent talks between officials from my Department and representatives from  Educate Together, there was a wide-ranging and constructive discussion about the issues associated with Educate Together's application to become a patron at second level.  The discussion also focussed on the blueprint for post-primary education published by Educate Together in June of this year.  This blueprint outlines the approach by Educate Together to providing an inclusive education where all young people, whatever their ability, will be provided with learning opportunities and classroom practices that explicitly take account of the different ways students learn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192">Educate Together's proposal not to stream students at second level was one of a wide range of issues discussed at the meeting with them.  The main focus of the discussion related to the potential enrolments in any school given recognition by the Department, the necessity to cater for as wide a range as possible of the community served by the school and the extent of curricular range that would be available in an Educate Together school.  My Department does not oppose the principle of mixed ability classes.  The purpose of raising the issue was to seek clarification on how a policy of not streaming pupils would be implemented in practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193">In view of the range of issues involved, it has not been possible to bring this matter to a conclusion as quickly as I would have liked.  However, it is my intention to finalise this matter and convey a decision to Educate Together at the earliest date possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1196">I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 60 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">I am very conscious of the hardship being experienced by many people across the country due to the recent unprecedented flooding. In regard to University  College Cork specifically, I visited the University yesterday to view the position at first hand.  My Department has also received an initial report from the University Authorities detailing the extensive flood damage caused to educational facilities and student residences.  I understand that 29 of the University's individual buildings were flooded including the recently constructed IT Building.  I further understand that approximately 30 acres of the University's 80 acres land bank were submerged in flood water.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">Apart from damage to buildings and facilities, at the human level I understand that close to 2,000 students were forced to evacuate their student residences.  A significant recovery effort involving well over 150 people has been undertaken with an emphasis on addressing emergency and safety issues.  I congratulate all involved in working speedily to minimise risks and restore as best as possible normal activities at the University.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">I have been advised by the Higher Education Authority that the University has in place adequate and appropriate levels of insurance.  Loss assessors acting on behalf of the insurers have already visited the University to examine at first hand the extent of damage caused.  It is not possible at this early stage to quantify the full extent of the damage until further surveys and assessments are complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">Finally, the Deputy may recall that earlier this year I extended a scheme of minor works funding that existed within the institute of technology sector to the country's 7 universities.  Under the scheme, UCC derived funding of €3.6m in the current year.  This funding will enable the college to address urgent small-scale capital issues on a priority basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">Loss of personal property would also fall to be dealt with by individuals' insurers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1203">As I have indicated previously to the House, I am currently in the process of reviewing my Department's school building and modernisation programme with my officials in the context of the Estimates for 2010.  I intend making a further announcement on the school building programme when that review has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">Decisions in respect of the expenditure of the annual allocation are made on the basis of the elements of the school building and modernisation programme that are most pressing in terms of need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at primary and post-primary levels over the coming years.  The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in 42 selected locations across the country, based on significant changes to the demographic profile of those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206">This information has been circulated to all existing school Patrons who have been invited to bring forward proposals for the expansion of existing schools or indeed to put themselves forward as Patron for any new primary school, should it be required.  The requirement for the establishment of new schools will of course be lessened where it is possible to expand and extend existing schools in those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">In addition, this Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our existing school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum in those schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">The principal component of the school building and modernisation programme is, and will remain, the delivery of large scale projects which consist of either new schools or major extensions or refurbishments of existing schools.  However, the level of demand on the school building programme is such that all projects cannot be carried out together.  They will have to be carried out over time in a structured and coherent manner and that is the reasoning behind the Department's published prioritisation criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">Other factors which have to be taken into consideration include contractual commitments which will be carried into 2010 from this years programme and the procurement of sites where this is necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">I should add that in addition to the major projects, there are a number of other schemes in operation, such as the Summer Works Scheme, the Energy Efficiency Scheme, the Permanent Accommodation Scheme and the Emergency Works Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">All of these factors will inform the Departments Building Programme for 2010 and subsequent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1213">The review of policies and procedures for the provision of temporary classroom accommodation is well underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214">One change in policy that has been implemented is to grant aid the purchase (rather than rental) of temporary accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than 3 years.  Furthermore, since July  2008, it is my policy to offer schools being approved for grant aid for temporary accommodation the option to use their capital grant aid to build a permanent classroom(s) rather than purchase a prefab.  As at the end of October 2009, 210 schools have been approved funding for the purchase of prefabricated classroom(s) with the option of building a permanent room(s).  61 of the approved schools have indicated to my Department that they intend purchasing prefabs and 60 intend to use the grant-aid to build a permanent room.  The remaining schools have not yet indicated their preference.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">These policies will reduce the usage of temporary accommodation and, particularly, the incidence of long term rental of prefabs and have already contributed to emerging savings of approximately €14m on annual expenditure on rental of temporary accommodation in 2009 as compared to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">In addition, my Department has engaged a specialist firm to develop new procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money.  Work is well underway and the firm of specialists is working closely with officials in the Planning and Building Unit of my Department.  The review incorporates the development of standard specifications for temporary accommodation, the development of new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances and appropriately protect the interests of the Department and school authorities.  My Department has received a draft of a new contract for the provision of temporary accommodation which is currently under consideration.  The work on the development of standard specifications is also well advanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">Another strand of the review is negotiations with prefab suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts or reductions in annual rent, as appropriate.  An initial group of 46 schools with rented prefabricated accommodation has been identified for priority negotiations with suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">I expect that I will be in a position to approve a number of these purchases of prefabricated accommodation in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">The focus of this review is the development and adoption of practical measures and policies to achieve best value for money in the area of temporary accommodation in schools and not on the production of a written report.  The target outputs of the review include a set of standardised specifications for prefabricated accommodation, a suitable generic contract for the rental of prefabricated accommodation and recommendations for the buy-out of certain prefab rental contracts.  My officials will continue to evaluate the progress and outcomes of the review and report to me in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1222">I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 61 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">As the Deputy will be aware the student services charge is levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and students services.  These services may include on-campus medical and counselling facilities for students, access and disability services, careers office, student facilities, student clubs and societies etc.  Currently, the student services charge is decided annually by third-level institutions in consultation with the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and my Department.  Any change in the level of this charge would only be considered where the increase is intended to bring the amount contributed by students into line with the costs of the range of students services provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">As already announced, the Government indicated that it was prepared to accept increases in the level of this charge for the academic year 2009/10 to bring it to a limit of €1,500 in individual higher education institutions.  In the previous academic year, 2008/2009, the charge stood at €900.  The increase in the charge for the 2009/2010 academic year enabled individual institutions to bring the amount contributed by students more into line with the real cost of providing student services in those institutions.  This was agreed on the understanding that the revenue generated by the increase adopted by each institution would reflect their requirements in defraying the full cost of items that fall to be funded by the charge.  Where income from the charge did not previously meet the full cost of these services, this required an effective cross subsidisation by institutions from their general block grant funding.</p>

The Higher Education Authority has issued a Framework of Good Practice for the Provision of Student Services to the publicly funded higher education institutions.  The Framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source with particular emphasis on principles of transparency and accountability.  The HEA has written to all institutions on a number of occasions to ensure that correct procedures are in place, and to remind them of their function in relation to the student services charge, in accordance with the Framework of Good Practice.</p>

            <p eId="para_1228">It is not possible to assess the scale of drop out in the current year on the basis of data currently available to my Department and the Higher Education Authority. However, the issue of student retention is a priority issue for me and it is an issue that will increase in importance in light of the recent increases in student enrolments in the last two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">In light of my prioritisation of retention, the Higher Education Authority are currently researching this issue.  Improvements in the quality of administrative data due to the development of the Student Record System since 2004 are underpinning this new analysis of retention, progression and completion, which will be available early in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">The process of assessing eligibility for third level grants and the organisation, management and payment of student grants are matters for the relevant local authority or VEC.  These bodies seek to ensure students get decisions on their grant applications and are paid as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">The terms of the Higher Education Grants Scheme and the Vocational Education Committees' Scholarship Scheme for the 2009/10 academic year provide for the payment by the Local Authorities/VEC's of each maintenance grant in three equal instalments as early as possible in each term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">Students and parents should ensure that all necessary supporting documentation is provided at the earliest date to assist the awarding bodies to make prompt decisions on entitlement.</p>

            <p eId="para_1239">The Project Maths initiative is designed to encourage better understanding of Maths, to reinforce the practical relevance of maths to everyday life, and to ensure better continuity between primary and second level, and junior and senior cycle. It is being led by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, working in collaboration with my Department and the State Examinations Commission. The initiative started in 2008 and is being piloted in 24 schools.  The curriculum changes will be phased in over three years and mainstreaming will begin in 2010/11 in all schools, prefaced by a national programme of professional development for teachers which began in October and which will continue to at least 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">Students in the 24 schools involved in the initial implementation from September 2008 are experiencing mathematics in a new way.  Teachers are being provided with classroom materials to enable them to adopt the new approaches and will be supported professionally in embracing change.  These materials and supports will include lesson plans, with teacher guides and student worksheets, online exemplars and a range of assessment materials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">Project Maths is being supported by intensive investment in professional development for teachers.  A Maths Support Team has been appointed and some €3m has been provided for the programme in 2009 alone. Investment in professional development for teachers will continue in a rolling programme of reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">Project Maths is being implemented on a phased basis covering the following five strands of mathematics:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1243">Phase 1 Strand 1 statistics and probability;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1244">Strand 2 geometry and trigonometry</p>

The Geographical Information System contains information on all schools in the country, primary and post primary level, geo-coded to their location.

            <p eId="para_11735">The weekly training allowance paid to an apprentice who is attending off-the-job training in a FÁS Training Centre, Institute of Technology or College of Further Education is established by reference to the industry sector net pay norm.</p>
            <p eId="para_11736">To establish the net pay norm for a particular sector, FÁS use the following methodology: The gross wage norm notified by the sector in question is reduced by the amount of normal PAYE, PRSI and income levy deductions that ordinarily apply to the gross wage norm in the sector. The amount then remaining is the net pay norm for the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_11737">In the electrical sector, the gross wage norm for a fourth year apprentice is €647.01 and the combined equivalent PAYE, PRSI and income levy deduction is computed as €118.64.</p>
            <p eId="para_11738">The training allowance, based on the net wage norm for the sector, paid to fourth year electrical apprentices while attending off-the-job training is therefore €528.37 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_11739">As the weekly training allowance is not treated as pay under the PAYE and PRSI regulations, FÁS pay slips do not show deductions under these categories. Deductions made by FÁS from the gross wage norm are not for the purposes of PAYE and PRSI but rather to ensure that the training allowances are equivalent to the net rather than the gross industry wage in the sector.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_11743">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_11744">The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications submitted by post from March 2009 and those filed online from April 2009.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements or in instances where a Receiver or Liquidator has been appointed, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_11745">Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first ten months of 2009 at 67,207.  This figure exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_11746">Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</p>
            <p eId="para_11747">the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 51.5 although the Section is currently carrying two vacant positions which are due to be filled;</p>
            <p eId="para_11748">the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_11749">the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_11750">The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;</p>
            <p eId="para_11751">Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_11752">The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.</p>

            <p eId="para_11759">My Department, through Enterprise Ireland, is active both in assisting Irish indigenous companies to find new markets for their products and services and to increase their existing level of market share.  Encouraging companies to re-orientate towards the Eurozone in the first instance and, for those which are most capable, into areas such as the Gulf, Brazil, India and China, where economies are still growing is a priority.  I have been active in leading trade missions to develop new opportunities for Irish exporters and will continue to do so, to both existing long-established markets, to the new EU Member States and also to other emerging high-growth markets, with a view to increasing the share of exports by Irish companies worldwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_11760">Continuous productivity improvements are essential if Irish companies are to increase their export potential and reach the world-class standards necessary to meet the challenges of the international market place.  Sustainable economic recovery will be driven by enterprises focused on increasing their exports of innovative products and services in global markets. To support this, I launched the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund earlier this year, which enables internationally trading companies survive the current global downturn by supporting their drive to reduce costs and, through increased competitiveness, gain sales in overseas markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_11761">This month I announced that 7,478 jobs are to receive direct support under the first round of the Employment Subsidy Scheme (ESS).

The Scheme provides a subsidy of €9,100 over fifteen months per qualifying employee in vulnerable but viable firms.  Due to a lower than anticipated take-up, I will shortly be announcing details of a second broader call for ESS applications with extended eligibility criteria open to both exporting and non-exporting firms.</p>

            <p eId="para_11871">Directive 2007/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Assessment and Management of Flood Risk is primarily concerned with the assessment and management of flood risks, with the aim of reducing adverse consequences for human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity associated with floods in the European Community.</p>
            <p eId="para_11872">There is a strong degree of alignment between the recommendations of the Report of the Flood Policy Review Group of 2004 and the requirements of the EU Floods Directive.  The outputs from the flood mapping and Flood Risk Assessment and Management studies programme, which commenced on foot of the national flood policy, adopted by Government in 2004, will also satisfy the requirements of the Floods Directive.  Accordingly, the process of implementing the flood risk assessment programmes under national policy is taking place in conjunction with the transposition of the Floods Directive into Irish law.</p>
            <p eId="para_11873">It is expected that the transposition of the Floods Directive will be completed in the very near future and it is understood that this timing is in concert with many of the other member states.</p>

Local and other authorities have responsibility for maintaining other channels, as do private landowners.</p>

            <p eId="para_11882">On considering the introduction of a new tax or indeed an increase in current taxes a wide variety of factors are taken into consideration including the impact on cross-border trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_11883">The EU law for the control of excisable products, including the provisions for bonded warehouses and documented delivery between Member States, is set down in Directive 92/12/EEC. However, coal is not covered by this EU Directive, hence the requirements for warehousing and controlled delivery do not apply in the case of coal.</p>
            <p eId="para_11884">When new taxes are being introduced there are always practical issues in relation to implementation that require consideration. In that regard, as is normal practice, my officials in conjunction with the Office of Revenue Commissioners and other relevant Departments will engage with those sectors involved in the implementation of the carbon tax to minimise, in so far as it is reasonably possible, practical difficulties.</p>

            <p eId="para_11886">The flood relief scheme designed for Ennis comprises of three phases.  The Ennis Upper Scheme and the Ennis Lower Scheme are being funded and built by the Office of Public Works, while works at Aughanteeroe, in Ennis, are being funded by OPW and carried out by Ennis Town Council.

            <p eId="para_11887">In relation to the Ennis Upper Scheme, works are nearing completion in the town and works carried out to date held up under the recent flooding and saved much of the town centre in Ennis.  OPW is preparing to go to tender for a Civil Engineering Contractor in order to carry out the Ennis Lower Scheme.  A review of this phase has already taken place and the lower scheme will be subject to minor alterations arising from information gleaned during the current flood event.</p>

            <p eId="para_13064">At the outset the Deputy should note that the decision to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved. Therefore, neither I nor the Financial Regulator has any direct influence over the decision by the insurance industry to provide flood insurance cover in the Clonmel region again. That said however the Office of Public Works has informed me that the enhanced level of protection from flooding which will be provided by the Clonmel flood relief scheme, once completed, is something which they presume will be taken account of by the insurance industry. Therefore I would not be satisfied if the insurance industry failed to factor this development into any future risk based assessment on providing insurance cover in this area at the appropriate time.</p>
            <p eId="para_13065">It should also be noted that my Department is in regular contact with the insurance industry about a range of issues including the recent flooding. In this regard I am actively encouraging the industry to respond to the payment of claims as quickly as possible, and I understand that everything is being done to facilitate such a process.</p>
            <p eId="para_13066">Finally, while there is no Government insurance scheme in place for those affected by the recent flooding, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has announced the setting up of a 10 million euro fund to assist flooding victims.

Further details can be obtained on the Department of Social and Family Affairs website.</p>

            <p eId="para_13074">Section 467 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, provides for a tax deduction at an individual's marginal rate of tax in respect of the costs incurred by that individual of employing another person (including a person whose services are provided by or through an agency) to take care of him/herself, a spouse or a relative who is totally incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity. The maximum amount allowable for tax relief is €50,000. The scheme cost approximately €2.8 million in 2006, the latest year for which statistics are available. However, it is an important measure in allowing incapacitated individuals to be cared for in the home environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_13075">This cost recognises the contribution being made by private individuals — of the order of €4 million per annum, assuming the 41% rate of relief in all cases — in relation to their own care or the care of others, which otherwise might have to be borne by the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_13081">The table below sets out the projections for debt servicing costs for the period 2009-2013 as contained in the Supplementary Budget.  On the basis of the Supplementary Budget estimates, it is forecast that about one-fifth of our tax revenue would be required to service the national debt by 2013. In this context, it is important to note that debt servicing costs have a first call on resources; therefore an increase in these costs would have a significant impact on the level of resources that would be available to meet other needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_13111">*The sinking fund provision is a transfer from the current account of the Exchequer to the capital account of the Exchequer — it has no impact on the overall Exchequer balance — and represents an element of paying off the principal.</p>
            <p eId="para_13112">The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) have advised that, as is usual, the above estimates for debt servicing costs were prepared on the basis of the prevailing market conditions for Irish Government bonds at the time of the Supplementary Budget.  As with other budgetary estimates, these forecasts are being reviewed as part of the preparatory process in respect of Budget 2010 and the revised estimates will be published on Budget day, 9 December.</p>
            <p eId="para_13113">At end-2008 the national debt was some €50 billion and, by end-2009 is estimated to stand at approximately €76 billion.  If no action was taken to stabilise the public finances it is forecast that this would result in Exchequer deficits of approximately €25 billion a year and the national debt level would rise to about €175 billion by end-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_13114">In the absence of corrective adjustments, and based on technical estimates taking into account current debt dynamics it is considered likely that debt servicing costs could be in the region of 25% to 30% of tax revenue by 2013.  If less benign assumptions were made concerning the market reaction to not addressing our mounting debt, or delaying correction over a ten year period, it is reasonable that the proportion of resources going on servicing the debt would rise further, thus leaving less for vital services.  Bridging the gap between income and expenditure through ongoing increased borrowing is not a viable solution in the medium to long-term.  We must make the necessary adjustments now to stabilise the deficit and Budget 2010 is being framed in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_13123">North-South remains a high political priority for the Government.  In particular, the Government is committed to realising the full potential for the development of all-island co-operation through the North South Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government is also committed to maximising the drawdown of EU Structural Funds allocated to Ireland including the funds allocated under the INTERREG IVA Programme (Ireland-Northern Ireland-Scotland).</p>
            <p eId="para_13124">The INTERREG IVA Programme aims to support strategic cross-border co-operation and economic development.  The Programme (2007-2013) is managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB).</p>
            <p eId="para_13125">The Cross Border Local Authority Groups were established as a network of councillors from the Ireland/Northern Ireland border and offer the opportunity for a co-ordinated and strategic cross border response to local issues.  The Groups, based on their experience of managing EU funding on a cross border basis in the previous round of funding, have been identified as a key implementation partner for the INTERREG IVA programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_13126">The Monitoring Committee which oversees the implementation of the programme met on 28th October 2009.  It was reported at the meeting that 94 applications had been received by the INTERREG IVA Programme by September 2009 and 34 of these had been recommended for approval at a total value of €152.6m.  It should be noted that proposed projects are subject to approved selection and assessment criteria under an agreed process and therefore individual projects must complete the process before spending can commence.  The Monitoring Committee was informed that for some projects this is expected to be completed very shortly.  The SEUPB also advised at the meeting that the key 2009 N+2 EU expenditure target will be achieved.  The INTERREG IVA Steering Committee, on which my Department is represented, will be considering the administration costs in implementing the INTERREG IVA programme for these bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_13127">My Department, as co-sponsor of the SEUPB with the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland, continues to monitor the performance of the programme and is working with its counterparts to ensure full implementation of the programme and full drawdown of the EU funds available.</p>

While the precise yield would depend on how the graduated introduction between €200,000 and €250,000 would be implemented, it is estimated that the additional full year yield to the Exchequer from this change, based on the available data for 2007, would be of the order of €6 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_13235">As the Deputy is aware, yesterday I published the draft Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme or ELG Scheme, and I intend to bring this Scheme, which has received EU State aid approval, before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 3 December next.</p>
            <p eId="para_13236">Term deposits with a term of up to five years will be covered by the ELG Scheme, regardless of the nature of the depositor or the nature of the deposit, provided that they are incurred between the period from the commencement date of the ELG Scheme up to and including 29 September 2010, subject to the approval of the EU Commission at six monthly intervals.</p>
            <p eId="para_13237">The ELG Scheme is intended to facilitate the ability of credit institutions in Ireland to issue debt securities and take term deposits with a maturity post-September 2010 of up to five years, on either a guaranteed or unguaranteed basis. No provision has been made to allow the participating institutions to incur guaranteed liabilities or to accept guaranteed deposits after 29 September 2010. Demand deposits will remain guaranteed until 29 September 2010 subject to the approval of the EU Commission at six-monthly intervals.</p>
            <p eId="para_13238">As the Deputy may be aware, the €100,000 limit under the existing Deposit Protection Scheme still applies.  It is important to note that the €100,000 deposit guarantee is not subject to review and does not expire on 29 September 2010. All deposits of less than €100,000 are fully guaranteed under the Deposit Protection Scheme and are not impacted in any way by the CIFS Scheme or the ELG Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_13239">In relation to any link between the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) and the bank guarantee, these are among the suite of measures which have been introduced to stabilise the financial system and in their totality will result in a reformed, reinvigorated and stable banking system which can meet the needs of the economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_13445">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recently completed historical data available on incomes is in respect of the income tax year 2007. On this basis the information requested in relation to income earners earning over €100,000 by reference to income quartiles is set out in the tables below. To assemble the figures by income quartile, the total number of income earners with earnings over €100,000 on the income tax record for 2007 was broken down into 4 equal groups in each sector and distributed over 4 income ranges in ascending order of income. The figures for gross income and the mean and median incomes were then established for each quartile group as appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_13545">Correspondence has been received from the business in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_13546">The windfall tax rate of 80%, which was introduced under the National Asset Management Agency Act, will apply to the portion of any profit or gain made on the disposal of land which is attributable to a rezoning, where both the rezoning and the disposal of land giving rise to the windfall occur after 30 October 2009.  The rationale for taxing this part of the profit or gain at a higher rate is because it is attributable to an administrative decision — that is, to rezone the land — rather than to anything done by the landowner.</p>
            <p eId="para_13547">A rezoning for windfall tax purposes is defined as a change from a non-development land use to a development land use or a mixture of such uses, or a change of development land use.  If no change of zoning is required, or if the land was rezoned before 30 October 2009, the windfall rate will not apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_13548">For the purpose of the windfall tax, "non-development land use" means agricultural, amenity, open space or recreational use, and "development land use" means residential, commercial or industrial use.</p>
            <p eId="para_13549">The 80% rate only applies to the portion of the profit or gain on the disposal of the land which is attributable to a rezoning.  The balance of the gain is taxable at the normal capital gains tax rate, if the disposal is treated as a chargeable gain, or at the appropriate income tax or corporation tax rate, if the disposal is as part of a trade of dealing in or developing land.</p>
            <p eId="para_13550">It would not be appropriate for me to discuss the specific business.  However, as the Deputy is aware, all taxes and potential taxation measures are constantly reviewed in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill.</p>

For the first six months of 2009, there were  4,092  inspections where compliance with country of origin of beef regulations was assessed and of these, 1,108 were found to be non-compliant. In these cases, Environmental Health Officers took follow-up action, such as return visits and letters of warning, to ensure compliance. No prosecutions took place during this period.</p>

From January to September 2009 a total of 10,261 hygiene inspections have been carried out by the Local Authority Veterinary Inspectors.  Labelling inspections are carried out as part of the hygiene inspections of food businesses.  There have been 9 cases of non-compliance under hygiene regulations so far this year and no cases of non-compliance under country of origin legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_13557">The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Food conducts labelling checks as part of the routine official checks at meat plants where there is a permanent presence of DAFF Veterinary or technical staff. Checks are conducted on a random, risk based frequency and cover labelling, traceability/origin, identification of cattle, labelling of carcasses, meat, mince meat, meat products.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_13567">I have responsibility for the implementation of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which is being introduced in January 2010 and also for the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) which was introduced in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_13568">Many community-based childcare services were, immediately prior to the introduction of the CCSS,  supported under the staffing grant scheme implemented under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP).  To assist services to adapt to the new funding arrangements provided for under the CCSS  transitional funding measures were introduced under which participating services are guaranteed minimum funding levels based on their EOCP grant amount in 2007.  As a result, services were guaranteed at least 95% of their 2007 funding level in 2008, at least 85% of the 2007 funding in 2009, and are guaranteed at least 75% of the 2007 funding in 2010.  Under this arrangement community childcare services participating in the CCSS are being funded based on the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from the service, plus in some cases a top up amount to ensure they receive the guaranteed funding provided for under the transitional measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_13569">In most cases, the level of funding paid to community services in the CCSS has increased and, in the absence of the ECCE scheme in 2010, not more than 25% of services would have been expected to qualify for the transitional rate.  Community-based services may choose to participate in either or both schemes from January, however this will not increase the 75% funding guaranteed in 2010.  Where a service participates in both schemes, the parent will choose the scheme that is most beneficial for their child.  No child may be funded under both schemes as this would be double-funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_13570">The following is an example of how funding will be generally applied to a service which chooses to participate in both schemes.  A service which received €80,000 funding in 2007 and which would have qualified in 2010 for subvention amounting to €50,000 (in the absence of ECCE funding), would receive €10,000 in transitional funding, bringing its total funding to €60,000.  If the service qualifies for €19,600 in ECCE funding and their subventions are €10,000 lower (as a result of ECCE supported children choosing that scheme over the CCSS) it will receive €59,600 in total capitation and subvention in 2010 resulting in €400 of transitional funding to bring it to €60,000.  This funding arrangement is being implemented to ensure that childcare services participating in both childcare programmes are not double-funded.</p>
            <p eId="para_13571">In relation to the childcare service referred to by the Deputy, I understand that the service has made an initial application to the ECCE scheme and is currently considering whether to go to contract. The service has been funded under the EOCP and currently under the CCSS programme and will be guaranteed in 2010 at least 75% of the funding provided to them in 2007.  However, the total funding which childcare services participating in both the CCSS and the ECCE programmes will qualify for in 2010, and which will be based on the example above, cannot be determined until early next year when the parental returns in relation to both schemes are submitted.</p>

            <p eId="para_13598">The adverse reactions in Canada occurred following vaccination with Arepanrix.  Arepanrix is an H1N1 vaccine which is not used in Ireland and is currently only available in Canada, where a single batch of vaccine has been quarantined, due to a suspected but unconfirmed increase in reporting of cases of anaphylaxis.</p>
            <p eId="para_13599">Anaphylaxis is an acute, allergic type response which can involve multiple body systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, skin and mucosal) and may rapidly progress to a severe, life-threatening reaction. It may occur following exposure to allergens from a variety of sources including food, insect bites/stings, as well as medicines and vaccine.  The risk of vaccine-induced anaphylaxis is thought to occur at a frequency of between one and ten cases per million doses of vaccine given.</p>
            <p eId="para_13600">The prescribing information for the H1N1 vaccines warn of this possible risk and the need to ensure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event. The Irish Medicines Board continues to advise healthcare professionals to be prepared to treat allergic reactions, including rare cases of anaphylaxis appropriately, when administering any vaccine including both of the H1N1 vaccines in use in Ireland (Celvapan and Pandemrix). For both of these vaccines, the number of reports of anaphylaxis received throughout the EU remains in line with the broadly accepted frequency estimates of vaccine induced anaphylaxis.</p>

            <p eId="para_13607">That report noted that, in the absence of a national register, estimating the numbers of persons with known disease is difficult and we must rely on secondary sources.  The report identified a number of prevalences for haemochromotosis in populations, ranging from 0.2% to 1% of the population.  Based on a prevalence of 1 in 100, the report estimated that 40,000 individuals carry the gene mutation causing hereditary haemochromotosis.

            <p eId="para_13611">The Irish private health insurance market operates on the principle of community rating, where all persons pay the same amount for the same health insurance contract, irrespective of age, health status, gender or other issues.  In order for community rating to work a system of risk equalisation is required, where insurers with a younger cohort of customers compensate those with an older cohort of customers.  Following the decision of the Supreme Court in 2008 that the Irish risk equalisation scheme was <i>ultra vires</i>, measures needed to be put in place to ensure that private health insurance remained affordable for older people.  The interim scheme provided for in the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 consists of an age-related tax relief which is funded by a levy placed on the private health insurance companies. </p>
            <p eId="para_13612">The scheme operates by giving tax relief to private health insurance companies applied in respect of each insured person over the age of 50 as below:</p>
            <p eId="para_13613">50-59: €200;</p>
            <p eId="para_13614">60-69: €500;</p>
            <p eId="para_13615">70-79: €950;</p>
            <p eId="para_13616">80+: €1,175.</p>
            <p eId="para_13617">The scheme will have the effect of ensuring premia prices are community rated at net cost to the consumer, and that each person will pay the same amount, net of tax reliefs, for the same policy.   The additional tax relief under the scheme is being granted at source to the insurer.  It is granted on the basis that the insurer must charge the same net premium to all persons covered by a plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_13618">In order for the scheme to remain cost-neutral to the Exchequer, the age-related tax credit is funded by placing a levy on private health insurance companies for each insured person.  For 2009, this levy is set at €160 per person, and €53 per child insured.  It is important to stress that the levy is applied to the private health insurer, not to the individual customer.  It is a commercial matter for each individual company to decide whether or how much of the levy they pass this on to their customers.  In those circumstances, and in a community rated market where all insured people pay the same price for the same contract, it would not be possible to allow for any exemption from the levy for individuals.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_13668">Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) 32 local health areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_13669">Under the HSE's 2009 Service Plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will transfer to the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.  The initial phase of the centralisation process commenced in January 2009 with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices in Dublin City to the PCRS.  The phased implementation will allow the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.  The PCRS has processed over 55,000 medical card applications since the start of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_13670">The HSE has informed my Department that the transfer of the case load from the two local health offices included a backlog of some 6,500 open cases which are being dealt with as a matter of urgency by the PCRS, and as a result, resources which would have been deployed in customer relations and phone answering have been assigned to deal with this backlog.  The HSE is arranging that additional resources are deployed to respond to phone queries, the majority of which relate to the outstanding applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_13671">The Executive has advised my Department that there are no plans to close any of the local health offices and these offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process.  The HSE has recently put in place a national on-line system to allow local health offices track the current status of applications in the PCRS.</p>
            <p eId="para_13672">The centralising of the medical card application process is facilitating a number of enhancements to the level of customer service associated with these applications.  The HSE has indicated that a facility will shortly be available where a person can view the status of their medical card application on-line and if a mobile phone number is supplied with an application, updates by text message will be delivered to the applicant's phone.</p>
            <p eId="para_13673">I fully support the HSE's decision to centralise the medical card and GP visit card application and review process to one location.  The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, this measure will ensure:</p>
            <p eId="para_13674">Improved turnaround time for the processing of applications (Under the new arrangements, the Executive will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications.  Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours);</p>
            <p eId="para_13675">Equitable application of eligibility across the country;</p>
            <p eId="para_13676">Consistency of service provision to customers;</p>
            <p eId="para_13677">Clearer lines of governance and accountability; and</p>
            <p eId="para_13678">Improved unified data.</p>
            <p eId="para_13679">My Department is currently in discussion with the HSE about putting in place a dedicated telephone number for Oireachtas members for enquiries about applications being processed by the PCRS.</p>
            <p eId="para_13680">The HSE has also indicated that this project, while realising health sector efficiencies and savings, will not have an adverse affect on patient care or the quality of service provided.  Applications from people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will also be processed by the PCRS.</p>
            <p eId="para_13681">This project is an example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach in November 2008.  It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.</p>

            <p eId="para_13715">The Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 incorporates provision for a new licensing system that will be implemented by the National Transport Authority and will be applied in respect of all commercial public bus passenger services. A feature of that system is that its implementation is dependent on the production by the Authority of guidelines under section 23 of the Act. Drafts of guidelines will be subject to a broadly based consultation process, which will include a requirement that the Authority must seek and consider the views of the Competition Authority, in relation to competition issues, and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport. Pending the completion of that process and the publication of the resultant guidelines, the current arrangements under the Road Transport Act 1932 and the Transport Act 1958 in relation to the licensing and authorisation of public bus services will continue to apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_13716">Accordingly, the determination of submissions from Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann in respect of the introduction of new services or the alteration of existing services will continue to be considered with reference to section 25 of the Transport Act 1958.</p>
            <p eId="para_13717">The position in relation to the proposal by Dublin Bus to alter the terminal point of its 37 Service is that the Company notified my Department in May 2008 and again in July 2008 of its intention to alter the terminus of route 37 from Diswellstown Road in Carpenterstown. These notifications were not refused, but on each occasion my Department deemed that the proposed amendment to the route would result in competition with an existing licensed passenger service.</p>
            <p eId="para_13718">Accordingly, Dublin Bus was advised that an application in accordance with Section 25 of the Transport Act, 1958 was required. No such application has been received from the Company.</p>
            <p eId="para_13719">A further notification received from the Company in relation to route 37, is currently under consideration by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_13753">The transfer of the sum referred to in the question is essentially an issue of accounting rather than funding.   It concerns the Health Services Executive (HSE) and the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), a functional unit of my Department's Immigration Division responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers through the policy of direct provision.  Underlying the explanation below is the fact that responsibility for the provision of accommodation for separated children seeking asylum (SCSAs) falls to the Health Services Executive (HSE) under section 8(5)(a) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).</p>
            <p eId="para_13754">In the period between 2002 and 2008 inclusive, an accounting arrangement had existed whereby RIA refunded the HSE, from the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the cost of accommodating SCSAs.  Such children were accommodated in centres run by the HSE and reimbursement of these costs was made by RIA on foot of vouched documents submitted on a regular basis over the course of the year by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_13755">It should be explained that these financial arrangements had been problematical because RIA (whose finances are covered in Subhead D4 of the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice and Equality) had financial but not operational responsibility for the accommodation of SCSAs.  It was, from an accounting perspective, an undesirable practice for an organisation that contracts and uses resources to be different from the one that pays for them.  RIA had no operational control over the centres engaged by the HSE for the accommodation of SCSAs and had no involvement in the negotiation of the relevant contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_13756">The process was therefore changed by agreement between RIA, the Department of Health and the Department of Finance when the sum of €3.5 million was transferred from the Justice Vote to the relevant Vote covering the HSE, effective in 2009.  The sum was calculated simply by reference to what had been reimbursed by RIA to the HSE over the preceding couple of years: for example, the amounts recouped by RIA totalled €3.17 million in 2007 and €3.47 million in 2008.  After 2009, the estimates process — through which monies are allocated to Votes — will take place in the normal way having regard to the fact that refunds of the cost of accommodating SCSAs will no longer take place between the Justice and HSE Votes.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_13766">I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_13767">The wide-ranging review of gambling currently underway in my Department has the objective of providing Government with options for a new and comprehensive legal and organisational framework governing the gambling architecture in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_13768">The initial consultation phase of the review process is now almost completed and since 1 May last the gambling material on my Department's website was viewed over 3,800 times; over 170 people / organisations have responded to the invitation to register on the website in order to obtain e-mail updates on the review process; over 60 submissions have been received from interested organisations and individuals (with a number of interested parties seeking a time extension in order to contribute to the review) and in the region of 50 meetings have been held with interested parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_13769">My Department will, with the benefit of the consultation process and an examination of the submissions received, develop legislative proposals based on three important considerations which are the hallmark of most well-regulated gambling codes.  These are:</p>
            <p eId="para_13770">that young people and the vulnerable are protected;</p>
            <p eId="para_13771">that gambling should in all respects be fairly and openly conducted, and</p>
            <p eId="para_13772">that gambling is kept free of crime</p>
            <p eId="para_13773">The proposed new gambling code will recognise the fact that people gamble and enjoy gambling and at the same time acknowledge that there are inherent dangers involved that need to be addressed, not least in terms of problem gambling.  I wish to assure the Deputy that the protection of young people and the vulnerable is foremost in my mind.  For the first time, therefore, our legislation governing gambling, including gambling by remote means such as the internet, will include measures aimed at mitigating the effects of problem gambling.  All organisations licensed by the new legislation to sell or otherwise provide gambling products to the population generally will be obliged to adopt mandatory codes of practice and procedures addressing this issue.  I am certain of one thing, it is only through strict regulation that the downsides of gambling will be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_13774">The Deputy will appreciate that developing a revised gambling code that is capable of generating broad public support is a complex task.  Notwithstanding that, I have instructed the Casino Gaming Control Section to make every effort to provide me with policy options for a new gambling architecture with all possible expedition.  The policy options will lead to the publication of a draft Bill on the subject.  Ultimately, of course, it will be for Government to agree the policy approach to be legislated for in this area.</p>

More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is in the final stages and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_13783">The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         if programmes have been developed to assist persons who have previously been in prison to access employment opportunities; the number of participants; and the success rate in progressing to placement in employment. 
        [44412/09]

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_466">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_13831">I can advise the Deputy that there are three programmes which have been developed to assist persons to access employment who have previously been in prison. These programmes are run in partnership between Business in the Community Ireland (BITC) and the Probation Service or the Irish Prison Service. They are:</p>
            <p eId="para_13832">The Linkage Programme;</p>
            <p eId="para_13833">The Prison Project and</p>
            <p eId="para_13834">The Mentoring Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_13835">The Linkage Programme</p>
            <p eId="para_13836">The Linkage Programme prepares, plans, and implements training and/or employment placement for ex-offenders referred to the programme by the Probation Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_13837">Since its inception in February 2000 and up to October 2009, the Probation Service made a total of 9,204 client referrals to the Linkage Programme.  Of that number, 5,755 or 74% engaged with the programme.  Of those who engaged, 3,988 or 69% were placed in employment settings.   Furthermore, Linkage Training &amp; Employment Officers (TEOs) made a total of 6,429 or 112% placements, meaning that some clients, because of progression routes etc, were placed twice.   It should be noted that, as well as community based referrals, these figures include referrals made through Linkage's inreach service to prisons in Ireland.  In the current year, the Linkage Programme has been approved for and received €1.47m in funding from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_13838">The Prison project</p>
            <p eId="para_13839">The Prison Project is an employment gateway project which grew out of the success of the Linkage Service.   It has been in operation since 2007 and is funded by the Irish Prison Service. The Prison Linkage Service employs three TEOs operating in Mountjoy (The Dochas Centre; St. Patrick Institution; The Training Unit; ), the Midlands Prison and Portlaoise Prison. The service is based on ‘guidance' and ‘placement' in, or towards, employment but has the added dimension of ‘resettlement' as prisoners are released to the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_13840">A key component of the Prison Linkage Service is that TEOs continue the service into the community, thereby offering throughcare in guidance and placement services to clients who become ex-prisoners. As such, the Prison Project is a natural complement to the Integrated Sentence Management (ISM) initiative currently being implemented by the Irish Prison Service.  It is planned to develop the Prison Project in line with needs and as the resources become available.</p>
            <p eId="para_13841">To date, the Prisons project has received a total of 850 referrals from the various prison sources.  Of those who engaged (670 or 79%), 150 (22%) were placed in training, education or employment while in custody, with a further 222 (33%) placed following release — a total of 55% placement rate, with the remaining numbers continuing to successfully engage with the Training &amp; Employment Officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_13842">The Mentoring Service</p>
            <p eId="para_13843">The Mentoring Service is the newest of BITC's programmes.  It is co-funded under Dormant Accounts Funding and by the Irish Prison Service and is a partnership between BITC and the Irish Prison Service that is still in its pilot phase. It has been operational for just over 6 months.  The objective is to provide intensive support to prisoners on release from prison to enable them to  access services that promote stability and desistance. Supported access to employment related services, e.g. training and education, is part of this process and in this sense the programme has an ‘employability' remit. Currently the Mentoring Service operates in Castlerea and Cork Prisons with plans to extend it. The intensive nature of the service means caseloads are smaller than they are for other services but this is in line with the needs of many criminal justice clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_13844">Other Initiatives</p>
            <p eId="para_13845">In addition to the above BITC has also designed and delivered, in conjunction with the Probation Service, employment related training programmes for ex-offenders, developed a protocol with FAS to facilitate referral from the Probation Service and IPS and assisted in developing a fund to support ex-offenders into training and/or education, considered as incremental steps towards employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_13846">The Education Fund is an initiative driven by BITC for its sister organisation the Community Foundation for Ireland and the St. Stephen's Green Trust.  The object is to provide small amounts of funding to ex-offenders who have been turned down by other sources. The primary objective is to support ex-offenders into some form of training and education that can ultimately lead to employment.  The fund is new and set for its initial trial period at €15,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_13847">In addition to the Education Fund, there is also a Social Enterprise Exploration fund of €20,000 contributed by BITC. The purpose of this is to support the development of social enterprise ideas that further the employment prospects of criminal justice clients, and although new, the fund has already contributed to a feasibility study in recycling.</p>

Thermostatic valves have also been installed on radiators where possible and the Department follows engineering advice in respect of heating and electrical installation generally, as well as technical advice from the OPW in this field.  I can also inform the Deputy that my Department is participating in the Office of Public Works programme entitled 'Optimising Power @ Work, Staff Energy Awareness Campaign'.  This project aims to conserve energy in State Buildings and has as its objective a 15% reduction of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions in all of the targeted State Buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_13850">It is not possible to accurately quantify heating costs for all buildings occupied by my Department and its agencies as heating costs cannot always be differentiated from other  maintenance costs for these buildings.</p>

Accordingly my Department has not entered into an arrangement for the purchase of any electric vehicles in 2009 or 2010.  In 2009 to date my Department purchased six official vehicles in respect of our Missions abroad. Five of these were replacement vehicles.  In addition there were five vehicles purchased by Irish Aid. Three are replacement vehicles and two are new vehicles which were purchased for the Malawi country programme, Irish Aid's most recent programme country.</p>
            <p eId="para_13933">Since the beginning of 2006, carbon emissions have been taken into account in vehicle purchases made by my Department. In June 2008, in order to take account of the wider availability of new technologies, my Department issued an updated policy position on the purchase of official vehicles, which ensures that environmental considerations are taken fully into account, as existing vehicles are replaced.  My Department's vehicle procurement policy is kept under regular review and will be refined as needed, to ensure that we keep pace with technological developments and best practice in this rapidly changing area.</p>

            <p eId="para_13937">Abdullah Öcalan had been held in solitary confinement since 15 February 1999 in the Imrali Island prison near Istanbul, as the only prisoner on the island.  During a visit to the prison in May 2007, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), an arm of the Council of Europe, strongly criticised his conditions of detention, and called on the Turkish authorities to "completely review the situation, with a view to integrating him into a setting where contacts with other inmates and a wider range of activities are possible."</p>
            <p eId="para_13938">In November 2008, the Turkish Justice Minister confirmed that a new prison facility was being constructed on Imrali with a view to transferring a small number of other prisoners to the island and ending Mr Öcalan's complete isolation. On 16 November 2009, the Turkish Government announced that the transfer of a limited number of prisoners to this facility would take place shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_13939">Recent reports suggest this move has now taken place and that Mr. Öcalan is no longer the sole prisoner on the island. It is expected that in the new prison he will have some limited contact with the other prisoners, although he may be housed in a smaller cell. Our Embassy in Ankara and our Permanent Representation to the Council of Europe are monitoring developments in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_13940">The Turkish authorities have faced a serious terrorist threat from the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which is included by the EU in its list of terrorist organisations. The Government in Ankara recently announced an outreach campaign towards the Kurdish minority. The measures include greater recognition of the rights of the Kurdish population, including use of their own language in daily life and in public affairs. We welcome this initiative by the Turkish Government and will continue to encourage the implementation of further reforms, which would ensure proper recognition of the rights of the Kurdish minority.</p>
            <p eId="para_13941">One of the key elements of the EU's enlargement negotiations with Turkey is to ensure that legitimate anti-terrorism and security measures do not undermine full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as set out in the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_13946">I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 234 to 236, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_13947">Since 2001, Government support for the horse and greyhound racing industries has been provided under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, which was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001.  In 2004, the Government put in place regulations to increase the limit of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund from €254m to €550m to continue the Fund for a further four years to 2008. By the end of 2008 a total of €545.8m was paid out of the Fund. The remaining balance in the Fund at the start of 2009 was €4.2m. €68.1m has been allocated to the Fund for 2009 and a regulation which increased the level of the fund by €63.907m has been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_13948">Funding of both Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon supports two very important productive industries and helps to sustain the important role of horse and greyhound breeding &amp; training enterprises in the development of the rural economy. These industries, together, account for an estimated 27,500 direct jobs, generate very substantial economic activity and make a vital contribution to the rural economy including farm incomes. Of the 27,500 direct jobs, 16,500 are in the horse racing industry, with the remaining 11,000 in the greyhound industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_13949">The funding has allowed Horse Racing Ireland to undertake a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.  The funding has allowed Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horseracing.  A review of the Fund has been completed and is currently being considered in the context of deciding on the future funding options for these industries.  The level of funding to the horse and greyhound racing industries in 2010 will be dependent on overall budgetary conditions taking into account the significant contributions that these industries make to the economy in general and the rural economy in particular.  The Horse Racing Ireland Annual Report for 2007 was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in May of this year and published thereafter.  The Horse Racing Ireland Annual Report for 2008 will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly and published thereafter.</p>

The changes in the staff numbers in the annual reports since 2005 were due to the establishment as separate legal entities of the National Museum of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland which were up to then part of the Department.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy John Curran)</from>
            <p eId="para_14383">The Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP) is a series of measures that are designed to counter disadvantage and to promote equality and social and economic inclusion. 37 Integrated Local Development Companies and 16 Urban Partnerships implement LDSIP locally. An allocation of €890,829 has been provided to the group referred to by the Deputy for the delivery of the programme in 2009 in County Clare.</p>
            <p eId="para_14384">The LDSIP and the Community Development Programme (CDP) are the Department's two main social inclusion-community development programmes. Both have a community development element and have been delivered through separate local delivery structures. For some time now my Department has been aware of the need to redesign and streamline these two programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_14385">In this connection, the Centre for Effective Services has very recently presented a new Programme outline to my Department, which I propose to accept.  The new Programme will preserve elements of good practice from the existing CDP/LDSIP programmes and will enhance monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. An implementation strategy, involving the stakeholders, is underway in preparation for programme roll-out in 2010.  This has been discussed with representatives from CDPs, Urban Partnerships and Integrated Companies at an Information Session which was held on Wednesday 25th November.</p>
            <p eId="para_14386">As previously signalled, it is my intention that CDP's, Urban Partnerships and Integrated Company structures should align, so as to minimise structures and provide a single integrated delivery structure for all areas.  In advance of decisions in the context of the 2010 budget, it is not possible to anticipate levels of funding available for the integrated programme next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_14387">While I cannot be specific at this stage about the impact on specific bodies in particular areas, the overall aim is to ensure that, from 2010, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focused programme with clear objectives and simplified and streamlined delivery structures, leading to significant administrative savings and impact efficiencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_14389">While my Department has not entered into any arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles during the period mentioned, the Deputy may wish to note that a pilot study on the concept development for a wind and ocean powered smart network for the supply of electricity, heat and transport for the Aran Islands has been jointly commissioned by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and my Department. One element of this project is to assess the ability of electric vehicles to meet the islands' transport requirements. In this context, SEI is currently making arrangements for 10 electric vehicles to be deployed on the islands and their usage to be monitored over a three-year period, commencing in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_14432">In recognition of the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country due to the recent flooding, the Government has allocated an initial sum of €10m to fund a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme.  The scheme is being administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_14433">The aim of the scheme is to provide financial support to people who have suffered flood damage to their homes and in doing so will provide hardship alleviation as opposed to full compensation.  As on previous occasions, commercial or business losses will not be covered by the scheme nor will losses which are covered by household insurance. Applications under the scheme will be means tested to ensure that available assistance will be prioritised for those who are most vulnerable.</p>
            <p eId="para_14434">The Community Welfare Service has already provided emergency financial and other assistance to households affected by the flooding to cover items such as clothing, food, bedding, heating, hire of dehumidifiers and emergency accommodation needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_14435">As the flood waters abate and people assess the full extent of the damage to their homes, qualified households can claim for essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods.  Assistance will also be available for structural repairs to homes not covered by household insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_14436">The level of payment available under the aid scheme to any qualified individual will depend on the severity of the damage to that person's home and the extent of the loss experienced as well as household income and general family circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_14437">People seeking assistance should contact their local Community Welfare Office. Further information and applications forms in relation to the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme are available from the Community Welfare Service in the affected areas and from the Department's website (www.welfare.ie) and the HSE's website (www.hse.ie). In addition the scheme is being advertised in the local media.</p>

            <p eId="para_14866">The Child Benefit scheme has, in recent years, experienced significant expansion in the volume of claims received, the rates of payment and the diversity of the customer base.  The annual cost in 2008 was approx. €2.46 billion and the payment is made to children of some 190 nationalities living in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_14867">Against this background, the control policy for the child benefit scheme has been reviewed to ensure that controls against fraud and abuse of the scheme continue to be effective and relevant.  As a result of the review, enhanced and updated control measures have been devised.  When implementing control initiatives, the Department is mindful of the need to target those areas that have been identified through Fraud and Error Surveys and on-going control projects as posing the higher risks.  Previous Fraud and Error Surveys, on both the Child Benefit scheme and other areas, indicated that non-Irish nationals pose a significantly higher control risk than the overall customer base.</p>
            <p eId="para_14868">The certification review process has initially focused on the highest-risk categories of customer and will be expanded to include other customer groups in the future. Currently the certification exercise in Child Benefit takes two forms. Employment certificates are issued, irrespective of nationality, to everyone, including Irish nationals, who are paid under EU regulation 1408/71. The majority of children in this group live outside Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_14869">Residency certificates are issued to all non-Irish national claimants, living with their children in Ireland. The certificates are issued to all non-Irish recipients — be they from within the EU or outside — and are not considered to be an infringement of civil rights.  They are a control measure applied equally to a sub-set of child benefit claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_14870">The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs Welfare Fraud report in September 2009 welcomed the introduction of the revised and more frequent residency and employment certification and was encouraged by the savings made so far as a result of these changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_14871">Child Benefit, with very limited exceptions, is payable to the mother of the children and, as with all Social Welfare claims, information is only requested of the person making the claim.  If the nationality of the mother is Irish she will not receive a residency certificate even if the husband is not an Irish national.</p>

            <p eId="para_14873">Since the publication of the Green Paper on Pensions in October 2007, the Government has taken several initiatives to respond to the immediate difficulties facing members of pension schemes, particularly of defined benefit schemes. We have moved quickly to assist pension scheme members through measures announced last December and the amendments passed in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_14874">The Government is aware that the wider and longer-term pensions policy issues require a comprehensive and co-ordinated response. Since the end of the consultation process last year, we have been considering a number of options to address the challenges facing our pension system and which were raised in the Green Paper process. This includes the operation of the homemaker's scheme, with particular regard being paid to the operative date of the scheme and the use of credits for pension purposes rather than the current system of disregards.</p>
            <p eId="para_14875">The Government will continue to discuss reform options, including any changes to the homemaker's scheme, for inclusion in the national pensions framework which will be published in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_14975">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  There are over 91,500 people in receipt of rent supplement of which over 33,300 are getting a supplement for 18 months or more.

The rent supplement means test provides for a gradual withdrawal of the supplement as hours of employment or earnings increase.</p>

Those accepted as eligible for accommodation under Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) may to return to full-time work, also subject to a means test, without losing the entire rent supplement payment. These measures are positive steps in assisting tenants to meet their housing needs while also increasing the financial return for those returning to work.</p>

            <p eId="para_14980">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) provides for a supplement to be paid in respect of mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_14981">The purpose of mortgage interest supplement is to provide short term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.</p>
            <p eId="para_14982">In general a person may be entitled to a mortgage interest supplement provided that:</p>
            <p eId="para_14983">s/he is habitually resident in the State,</p>
            <p eId="para_14984">the loan agreement was entered into at a time when, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, the person was in a position to meet the repayments,</p>
            <p eId="para_14985">the mortgage interest payable does not exceed such amount as the Health Service Executive considers reasonable to meet his or her residential needs. In exceptional circumstances, a supplement may be awarded where the mortgage interest exceeds such amount as the Executive considers reasonable but such a supplement is payable for a maximum of 12 months only,</p>
            <p eId="para_14986">s/he or spouse is not engaged in remunerative full-time employment,</p>
            <p eId="para_14987">s/he satisfies a means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_14988">Mortgage interest supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to family circumstances less a minimum weekly contribution of € 24, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than the minimum contribution because they are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_14989">The existing mortgage interest supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. In recent years improvements have been made to the means test to encourage eligible people to engage in employment without losing their entire mortgage interest supplement. Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_14990">Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_14991">Each application for mortgage interest supplement is determined by a community welfare officer taking account of the relevant legislative provisions and on the basis of the merits of each individual case. There is right of appeal against a refusal of mortgage interest supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_14992">A review of the administration of the mortgage interest scheme is currently underway. The main purpose of the review is to examine how the scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence and whether alternative approaches to achieving the scheme's objectives are warranted in the light of recent changes in the economic climate and the mortgage market. The full review should be completed in early 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_14995">The case reported on by the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) involves a couple who were over 56 years of age in 1988 when compulsory social insurance for the self-employed was introduced and who, therefore could not, satisfy one of the basic requirements for pension as they did not commence paying insurance ten years before pension age. A special pension paid at half the personal rate and requiring the payment of at least 260 contributions was introduced in 1999 to cater for people in these circumstances.  The IHRC recommended that a reduced benefit should also be paid to people who, because of advanced age, could not satisfy the conditions for this special pension.  This would be a significant departure from the principles underpinning qualification for pensions, and other benefits, which require that a minimum level of contributions should be made before a person can qualify for a payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_14996">The IHRC laid particular emphasis on Article 29, paragraph 5, of the European Code of Social Security which deals with the position of people who cannot satisfy new conditions because of advanced age when these are introduced.  In the context of submitting its annual report on compliance with the Code, the Department sought the view of the ILO Committee of Experts, which examines national reports on compliance with the European Code of Social Security on behalf of the Council of Europe. The final resolution on the Department's 2006/2007 compliance report from the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers found that "law and practice in Ireland continue to give full effect to the parts of the Code which have been accepted."</p>
            <p eId="para_14997">Earlier this year, the Department had further correspondence with the IHRC on the same issue in relation to the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_14998">The issues raised by the IHRC have been given full consideration by the Department and the IHRC has expressed its gratitude for the Department's ongoing engagement in relation to this.</p>
            <p eId="para_14999">Decisions on the future direction of state pensions policy, including the issue raised in the IHRC report, will be made in the context of the forthcoming national pensions framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_15001">The objective of the back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is to equip people on social welfare payments with qualifications that will enable them to obtain employment in the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_15002">In general, to qualify for the scheme a person must be progressing in education by reference to the National Framework of Qualifications.  A BTEA application will not be approved in respect of a person who holds a qualification equivalent or higher than the qualification for which the BTEA application has been received.  However, each case is treated on its merits and consideration can be given to approving an application in exceptional circumstances.  Factors taken into account would include the length of time since obtaining the first qualification, efforts to get employment with the qualification already held and periods of unemployment since obtaining the qualification currently held.   The main consideration in such cases is that the proposed further qualification will enhance substantially the person's employment prospects.</p>
            <p eId="para_15003">The Government recognises that the back to education scheme has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers.   The conditions of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.  All social welfare schemes are being examined as part of the deliberative process in advance of the annual budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_15042">Entitlement to benefits financed from general taxation, rather than social insurance contributions, such as child benefit and social assistance payments, are normally limited to residents in the State paying the benefits, in accordance with international practice. Persons coming from abroad who claim these benefits generally have to satisfy an habitual residence test, to avoid entitlement being granted to people who only have a temporary attachment to the State and whose main centre of interests is in other jurisdictions.   Habitual resident regulations on these lines were introduced in Ireland with effect from 1 May 2004 to ensure that persons who have not worked in Ireland or who have not established habitual residence here should not be eligible to avail of assistance schemes or child benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_15043">These regulations are kept under review. This is to ensure that they effectively meet the objectives of confining entitlement to people habitually resident in Ireland, especially in the way they are interpreted or implemented, but at the same time do not have the effect of depriving people of benefits to which they should have an entitlement. Account is taken in such reviews of similar provisions in other countries, especially in EU Member States, including Spain, with a view to ensuring that the objectives of the regulations are met in accordance with best international practice.</p>

The seven Irish personnel currently participating in ISAF, comprising 4 Officers and 3 Non Commissioned Officers, are located in the two ISAF Headquarters in Kabul. The Irish personnel work in staff appointments in planning and administrative roles.

            <p eId="para_15076">The recent decision by Sligo Borough Council not to include any specific objective for a critical new access link to the east of Sligo in their draft development plan, in line with current and previous development plans, will impact on the potential to provide a new compact and sustainable model of development for Sligo, including the future regeneration of the Cranmore area. My Department is currently examining the impact of the council's decision on the long-term sustainable options for the regeneration of the Cranmore area. Any decision on the Cranmore regeneration programme must await the outcome of this examination.</p>

            <p eId="para_15079">I propose to take Questions Nos. 276 and 277 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_15080">My Department's involvement with the new Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. These schemes, introduced in November 2007, are funded by 80% recoupments available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority. In the case of the older Disabled Persons' and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes, these are funded by 67% recoupments together with a 33% contribution from the resources of the local authority. The detailed administration of these schemes, including the assessment and approval of individual applications and the payment of grants to householders, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_15081">Details of the Exchequer funding provided to local authorities for these schemes for the years 2007 and 2008 and the total allocations for 2009 from Exchequer and local authority sources are set out in the following table.</p>

            <p eId="para_15239">I recently notified land-owners and the public of my intention to re-designate six existing sites in Dublin as Special Protection Areas further to Ireland's obligations under the 1979 Birds Directive. I have also proposed that one additional new site, Dalkey Islands, be designated. Five of the seven sites are island sites on which there is little agricultural activity of the type mentioned in the questions. The remaining two sites are estuarine, wetland sites  — Baldoyle Bay and Malahide Estuary — and I understand that there is little agricultural activity, if any, within these sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_15240">In general, the Birds Directive prohibits the deliberate disturbance of birds, particularly during the period of breeding and rearing, in so far as disturbance would be significant having regard to the objectives of the Directive. This applies to all species of naturally occurring wild birds in the State and applies regardless of whether the disturbance occurs within or outside an SPA. The Birds Directive also provides for derogation from these requirements in a number of situations including to prevent serious damage to crops, livestock, forests, fisheries and water. Licences are issued by my Department further to these derogation provisions.  In general, however, the use of traditional scarecrows that do not cause significant disturbance would not require a licence. Farmers who are in any doubt should contact the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_15241">The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has principal responsibility for the disbursal of EU and matching funding under the Rural Development Programme to assist farmers in meeting the requirements of the Birds and Habitats Directives and is kept fully informed of any designations.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_15243">As I indicated in my statement to the House on 24 November in relation to the recent flooding events, my Department has undertaken a range of measures and has instigated inter-agency co-operative initiatives to deliver a co-ordinated emergency response at both national and local level, through the local authorities' severe weather emergency plans. In respect of land use planning, I am committed to intensifying our actions to mitigate these adverse impacts for the future. The current flooding and other recent flooding events sharply illustrate the effects of inappropriate development planning and development management decisions in the past and underline the necessity for action to avoid such development in locations in which future flooding is like to occur, particularly on flood plains.</p>
            <p eId="para_15244">The First Schedule of the Planning and Development Act 2000 specifies, <i>inter alia</i>, that planning authorities may include in their development plans objectives regulating, restricting or controlling development in areas at risk of flooding. As highlighted in my Department’s 2007 Development Plan Guidelines, where development is proposed in an area at risk of flooding, it is a matter for each planning authority to evaluate such risk, on the basis of a flood risk assessment where appropriate, and planning permission may either be refused, or, if granted, can be made subject to conditions requiring the implementation of measures necessary to alleviate or avoid damage due to flooding.</p>
            <p eId="para_15245">Reinforcing this provision, I published, yesterday, the finalised Guidelines for Planning Authorities on the Planning System and Flood Risk Management which are aimed at ensuring a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to flood risk identification, assessment and management within the planning system.  These guidelines provide that:</p>
            <p eId="para_15246">development in areas at risk of flooding, particularly flood plains, should be avoided unless there are wider sustainability grounds that justify appropriate development and where the risk can be reduced or managed to an acceptable level;</p>
            <p eId="para_15247">a sequential approach must be adopted to flood risk management when assessing the location of new development based on avoidance, reduction and mitigation of flood risk; and</p>
            <p eId="para_15248">flood risk assessment must be incorporated into the process of making decisions on planning applications and planning appeals.</p>
            <p eId="para_15249">These statutory guidelines, when taken together with the legislative measures in the planning code, provide a sound basis for planning authorities to identify, assess and take appropriate steps to manage flood risk in a sustainable manner within their area.  I will continue to assess development and local area plans to monitor implementation of these principles at local level to ensure that future development takes account of these policies.</p>

Since 2002 my Department has provided grant assistance of over €100 million to local authorities towards the development of waste recycling facilities.  However, the green waste facility in question did not receive assistance under either the current<i/>Waste Recycling Capital Grants Scheme or the previous Waste Management Infrastructural Grant Scheme<i/>and therefore the question of recoupment of any grant paid does not arise. </p>
            <p eId="para_15285">The National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste was published in April 2006 and sets out measures to divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill in accordance with the targets in EU Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste.  These targets require progressive reductions in the amount of biodegradable municipal waste which was landfilled in the reference year of 1995. They are designed to achieve a reduction to 75% by 2010, 50% by 2013 and 35% by 2016.</p>

            <p eId="para_15640">Information on the trial, including trial reports, is available on the Department's digital television website www.digitaltelevision.ie.  There are no plans to reintroduce the trial.</p>
            <p eId="para_15641">The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 2007, which was superseded by the Broadcasting Act, 2009, made RTÉ responsible for providing a free digital television service throughout Ireland as a replacement for its analogue network.</p>
            <p eId="para_15642">Legislation also requires the newly established Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to provide for the development of commercial DTT services.  The BAI, which is an independent regulatory authority, is currently in negotiations with a company One Vision, to which it has offered a contract for the provision of commercial DTT services.  While I have no direct function in these matters, I am concerned on policy grounds to see an early agreement on the provision of commercial DTT services and an early time path for the implementation of such agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_15643">In relation to the rollout of DTT, RTÉ has made significant progress and continues to progress the rollout of DTT. The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that by 31st December 2011, or such later date as the Minister may decide, RTÉ must have a national DTT service in place.  To date, RTÉ has DTT enabled 13 sites to accommodate both the single free to air DTT multiplex and three commercial DTT multiplexes.  RTÉ Transmission Networks Limited (RTÉNL) is conducting tests at these sites, including the sites in Dublin and County Louth that were used during the Department's DTT Trial.  These tests include transmissions of the four national television services.</p>

            <p eId="para_15645">As the Deputy has suggested, the 2007 Bioenergy Action Plan for Ireland recommended that the REFIT tariff support scheme be expanded to facilitate delivery of co-firing in peat stations of 30% by 2015.  Since that time, both ESB and Bord na Móna have been conducting a programme of research and development, including large scale co-firing trials with a variety of materials.  Bord na Móna, for example, expects to burn between 70,000 and 75,000 tonnes of biomass this year at its Edenderry plant.  These trials have shown that, while co-firing is possible in some instances, there remain significant technical problems with particular types of biomass.</p>
            <p eId="para_15646">Bord na Móna and ESB have recently conducted a series of laboratory scale tests to ascertain the precise chemical and physical nature of these problems, and to determine what measures can be taken in order to redress these.  The final report of these tests is expected to be available in early January.  My Department is in close contact with both companies on this issue with regard to progressive delivery of the target.  However any decision on such a tariff would be premature until the final results are available.  Furthermore, this decision will be taken in the context of the policy discussion around the larger bioenergy sector which is currently ongoing through the Bioenergy Working Group, which is chaired by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_15647">Clearly, our objective would be to utilise domestically produced biomass as much as possible, and my Department and I are in close contact with the Department of Agriculture to ensure that support schemes for energy crops and forestry and coherent with demand.</p>

            <p eId="para_15653">Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the management, conservation, protection and development of the inland fisheries resource and in this case, the issue of licences, rests with the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards.  Licence duties are set by me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, at rates recommended by the National Fisheries Management Executive (Fisheries Boards Managers)</p>
            <p eId="para_15654">The angling and commercial salmon licence fee is made up of the licence fee and an equivalent sum, which is ring-fenced for salmon conservation initiatives.  The latter was introduced in 2007, as part of a suite of conservation measures for the management of the wild salmon fishery.  A Ministerial Direction under Sections 18A, 19(4) and 20(3) of the Fisheries Act 1980, required the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards to prepare and implement a programme for rehabilitation of salmon stocks, giving priority to rivers below their conservation limits; in special areas of conservation; and which have the greatest prospect of recovery; funded by the proceeds of the salmon conservation component of the salmon licence fees.  Works undertaken included catchment-wide electro-fishing, river bank protection, spawning grounds rehabilitation, in-stream works and habitat restoration, smolt rescue programmes etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_15655">In 2008, €1,394,469 was collected from the sale of angling and commercial licences, with 50% of this fee, €697,234 being allocated to salmon conservation initiatives and the balance being retained by the Boards and used to fund their activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_15656">Having regard to the considerable State investment in inland fisheries and the direct application of a very substantial part of the licence fee specifically to salmon conservation, there are no plans to apply an exemption rate for pensioners or the unwaged.</p>

            <p eId="para_15658">The Fodder Aid Scheme which I announced will require individual farmers to demonstrate that their fodder was damaged and the extent of that damage. Although this Scheme is targeted primarily at farmers in the West, Midlands and South West who suffered damage to fodder (silage or hay or concentrates) caused by flooding in November 2009, those farmers in other areas also affected by the recent flooding may also be eligible. However, given the<i/>importance of having the funding made available as quickly as possible to those most severely affected by the crisis, I would encourage only those farmers, who are directly affected,  to complete and submit the application without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_15659">The Scheme will operate on the following basis:</p>
            <p eId="para_15660">Financial aid will be paid in instances where genuine damage to silage or hay or concentrates was caused by the flooding in November 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_15661">Applications must be submitted by Friday 11 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_15662">All applications will be subject to an on-farm inspection and the damaged fodder must be evident.</p>
            <p eId="para_15663">Aid will not be payable where flood damage to fodder is covered by the farmer's insurance policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_15667">As an emergency response to the extreme flooding conditions in parts of the country, my Department has issued advice with regard to problems that may be experienced by farmers due to flooding.  Farmers are advised that in emergency cases, they are permitted to pump some water out of flooded tanks but only for reasons of animal welfare. Naturally, this concession will apply only in those areas that have been severely affected by flooding.  This relates to pumping out of excess water only. Tanks should not be agitated before pumping and farmers should use a sludge pump if possible rather than a vacuum tanker. The suction pipe should be inserted almost to the bottom of the slurry tank so that solids are not removed. The farmer should pump out no more water than is necessary to alleviate the immediate animal welfare problem. This water should not be discharged directly to a watercourse. If water is already above the level of the central passageway or the apron, there is no point in trying to pump water from the tank. In these cases, animals will have to be removed from the sheds.</p>
            <p eId="para_15668">This does not permit the application of slurry on land while the prohibited period for the spreading of fertilisers as set out in the Nitrates Regulations is in force in all parts of the country.  The planned review of Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme in 2010 will provide an opportunity for all stakeholders to put forward their views on the question of the most appropriate dates for the prohibited periods for spreading fertilisers that are a mandatory requirement under the EU Nitrates Directive. Any adjustment to Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme will require the agreement of the EU Commission.</p>

It is intended that this Scheme will consist of a range of targeted environmental actions from which farmers may choose.  Funding for the new scheme will be provided through the additional modulation funds which I ensured would be retained for the benefit of Irish farmers in the negotiations on the CAP "Health Check".  It will also include matching Exchequer funding.  My officials are at present in discussions with the European Commission on the details of the scheme.  The level of funding for the new scheme will be decided in the forthcoming Budget and in the context of the allocation of resources for my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_16931">There are just four farmers in the whole country still participating in REPS 2 and all have been paid in full.  I plan to introduce a new agri-environment scheme in 2010 which will reduce compliance costs to participants and which will provide a menu of targeted environmental actions from which farmers may choose.  Funding for the new scheme will be provided through the additional modulation funds which I ensured would be retained for the benefit of Irish farmers in the negotiations on the CAP "Health Check".  It will also include matching Exchequer funding.  My officials are at present in discussions with the European Commission on the details of the scheme.  The total level of funding for the new scheme will be decided in the forthcoming Budget and in the context of the allocation of resources for my Department.</p>

The balance of the second instalment of 40% due under the scheme will be paid early in 2010. The final instalment of 20% will be paid in January 2011. I have also announced that a special ex-gratia payment not exceeding 3.5% of the value of the deferred amount will be made to farmers whose grants have been partially deferred.

            <p eId="para_16939">The rules governing intra-community trade in live bovines are set out in EU Directive 64/432/EEC, which lays down the testing requirements for bovine TB and Brucellosis in all Member States. For a herd to retain official TB free status and eligibility to export live cattle to Member States, all animals on each holding, with the exception of calves under six weeks old which were born in the holding, must be subjected to tuberculin testing at yearly intervals. Thus, it is not possible to derogate any herd in Ireland from the requirement to test annually for bovine TB.</p>
            <p eId="para_16940">With regard to Brucellosis, following the attainment of officially brucellosis-free status by Ireland, I have announced a number of changes to the Brucellosis testing regime for this disease. These changes, which came into effect on 9 September, are as follows:  an increase in the age threshold for annual round testing to 24 months;</p>
            <p eId="para_16941">an increase in the validity period of the pre-movement test from 30 days to 60 days;</p>
            <p eId="para_16942">an increase in the age-limit for the pre-movement test for female animals from 12 to 18 months and, in view of the lower risk attached to their movement, to 24 months for bulls; and</p>
            <p eId="para_16943">an increase in the "one sale" rule for bulls from 12 to 24 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_16944">In addition, with effect from 1 January 2010, dairy herds scheduled to be tested in 2010 and 2011 will now only be tested every second year. In view of the fact that this disease, which has caused so much hardship to many farmers over the years, is still present on the island it is necessary to adopt a cautious approach to scaling down the testing programme.  Nevertheless, these decisions, which are risk based, will substantially reduce the number of animals required to be tested under the Brucellosis scheme and will result in a significant reduction in the cost of testing to farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_16950">Earlier this year I set up the Joint Advisory Group to explore, with industry, possible approaches to implementing the recommendations set out in the Strategy Group Report. The recommendations of the Advisory Group have been published in the "Smart Schools = Smart Economy" Report which the Taoiseach launched on 16 November last.</p>
            <p eId="para_16951">As I outlined at the launch of the report, I am committed to making funding available for ICT in schools over the next three years. As a first step, I am making available €22 million in ICT grants for primary schools this year. I already had €9 million in my capital allocation for ICT. I am adding €13 million from the school building programme allocation this year to give a total allocation of €22 million.  This €13 million represents about 2% of the overall allocation for school buildings this year. I have achieved significant savings on the schools capital programme this year, with tenders yielding a reduction of up to 30% compared to prices at the height of the construction boom.Last year I was not in a position to provide grants for ICT equipment as the €10 million capital allocation for ICT was put towards the cost of the primary school building programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_16952">The funding to primary schools is being issued with the priority on ensuring that there is a teaching laptop and digital projector in every classroom, in line with the recommendations of the Advisory Group, and the Strategy Group Report of 2008.  I intend making funding available for post-primary schools in the New Year.  I intend looking at central procurement arrangements going forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_16953">The total amount of funding to be made available for ICT equipment next year is being considered as part of the overall Capital allocation that is to be agreed by Government.  In order to ensure the use of ICT is embedded within the teaching and learning  in schools, we are progressing a number of strands in terms of use of ICT in schools — broadband connectivity for schools, infrastructure in schools, provision of digital content and teaching training.</p>

For marking the examinations, recruitment is prioritised on the basis of teaching experience/expertise, and it would not be feasible or desirable to depart from this practice.  For recruitment of superintendents, it is the practice of the Commission to recruit substitute and unemployed teachers as well as those with experience.  Accordingly it is open to recent graduates and younger teachers to apply for these posts.  Appointments are made on a county basis.  Surplus applicants are placed on a reserve panel which is drawn upon if vacancies occur, or if there is a shortfall in other counties.  Some 4652 superintendents were appointed by SEC in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_17162">It should also be noted that an additional 7500 superintendents were appointed directly by schools in 2009 to superintend special examination centres, primarily for students with special needs sitting examinations on their own.  The schools appoint superintendents they consider are best placed to meet the specific needs of the individual candidates.</p>

            <p eId="para_17217">I propose to take Questions Nos. 363 and 423 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_17218">The Deputy is referring to the details published by the Christian Brothers in  response to the call for further substantial contributions by way of reparation  following publication of the Ryan Report.  As the Deputy will recall this  House passed a unanimous motion calling on the congregations to commit to  making further substantial contributions by way of reparation, in the context  of discussions with the State, including to a Trust to be set up and managed by  the State for the support of victims and to other education and welfare  purposes.   When the Taoiseach and relevant Ministers, including myself, met  with representatives of the eighteen religious congregations who were party to  the 2002 Indemnity Agreement last June, the congregations indicated their  willingness to make further contributions.  Any such contributions are  separate from the 2002 Indemnity Agreement and associated contributions. The  current engagement with the religious congregations does not involve a  re-negotiation of that agreement.  The offers are not the subject of any  negotiation with the Government but rather are a matter for the religious  congregations to make in the light of the findings of the Ryan Report, the cost  of redress to the State, the resources available to the congregations and  ultimately for the public to judge.</p>
            <p eId="para_17219">While an overall offer of a contribution on behalf of the congregations  collectively was sought, the congregations' responses have been on an  individual basis.  A full set of responses is awaited. I expect to have the  complete set of responses from the congregations in the next day or so.</p>
            <p eId="para_17220">As the Deputy is aware, the Government has made clear that these contributions  need to be capable of being assessed by the public for their significance by  reference to the full resources available to the congregations and in the  context of the costs of well over a billion euro incurred by the State.  In  this context, the Government appointed a Panel of three independent persons to  assess the financial statements submitted by the congregations and report to  Government as to the adequacy of these statements as a basis for assessing the  resources of the congregations. The Panel submitted its Report at the end of  October. The Report was examined within my Department and a number of  clarifications were sought from the Panel.  In response, the Panel elaborated  on the relevant points within the context of its Report and submitted an  expanded Report on 25th November, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_17221">I will be bringing the Panel's Report and details of the congregations' offers  of contributions to the attention of the Government at the earliest  opportunity.  The position in relation to publication is that while it has  always been the intention to publish the conclusions of the Panel and the  offers from the congregations, the arrangements for publication will be  considered by the Government.  In this regard, I am concerned to ensure that  the survivors and their representatives are kept fully informed of  developments.   While the approach taken by any individual congregation is a  matter for them, my objective is to have the collective comprehensive position  available.</p>
            <p eId="para_17222">Once the full position is known, the Government will consider the uses to which  the contributions will be put, in consultation with the representatives of the  survivors and the congregations.</p>

            <p eId="para_17231">Circular 32/92 was introduced in December 1992 to assist Vocational Education  Committees in the process of assessment of qualifications of teachers who may  not have had a traditional teaching qualification but were involved in the  delivery of the Vocational Preparation Training Programmes.  Its use was  subsequently extended to non-mainstream posts in Vocational Education  Committees.  A Qualifications Committee and an appeals process was agreed under  PCW.</p>
            <p eId="para_17232">The Committee set out, in CL 47/00, the qualification requirements for  appointment to the posts in Beauty Therapy, Hairdressing, Arts Administration  and Veterinary Studies and PPT04/04 outlined qualifications for Complementary  Therapy.</p>
            <p eId="para_17233">The Teaching Council has taken over the role of designated authority for the  recognition and registration of all teachers since its establishment on 28  March 2006.  Registration is now governed by the Teaching Council's own  Regulations for Registration, which set out the required qualifications for  registration as a teacher in the various sectors, including the sectors  previously governed by 32/92. The Council's Regulations, for the most part,  continue the status quo that existed hitherto. The Regulations also bring  greater uniformity to the requirements for entry to the teaching profession at  primary, post-primary and further education levels. Among the new provisions in  the regulations is a requirement that, from April 2013, all new teachers in the  VEC and further education sectors will be required to have an approved teacher  education qualification.</p>

            <p eId="para_17245">Under my Department's Free Fees Initiative the exchequer meets the cost of  tuition fees in respect of eligible students.   The main criteria of the  Initiative are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold EU  nationality and have been ordinarily resident in an EU Member State for at  least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level  course.   Eligibility under the Free Fees Initiative is determined at the time  of entry to higher education for all such students and cannot subsequently  change during the student's course of study.</p>
            <p eId="para_17246">Where students do not meet the eligibility criteria of the scheme at the time  of entry to their course of study they must pay tuition fees as determined by  the relevant institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_17247">With regards to the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the position is  that students from new EU Member States who commenced higher education here  prior to accession are not eligible for free tuition fees as they did not meet  the criteria of the scheme at the time of entry to their third level course of  study.   In line with the terms of the scheme, such students cannot be  subsequently considered for free fees during their course of study.  Therefore  the student in this case was treated in the same way as all other students with  regards to determination of eligibility under the free fees scheme.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_17306">I propose to take Questions Nos. 393 to 396, inclusive, 401 and 402 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_17307">The October 2008 budget measures came into effect in the 2009/10 school year and did not have an impact on teaching posts in the 2008/09 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_17308">The Deputy will be aware that my Department has published provisional information on the Department's website about teacher allocations at primary and post-primary level for 2009/10 school year. This was done as a first step at improving the level of information in the public domain about changes to the staffing allocations at both primary and post-primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_17309">While the final position won't be clear until all allocations are completed it is envisaged that there will be a reduction in posts at primary level in the  200-300 range compared to last year's allocation. Allocations are continuing for special needs and language support so the precise figure won't be known until these posts are fully allocated.</p>
            <p eId="para_17310">At post-primary level my Department estimated that the budget changes would result in a reduction of some 1,000 posts but that all of this reduction would not happen in the allocation for this school year. Apart from the provision of additional posts for some demographic increase and for special needs provision  a number of additional factors influence the final net position such as the level of teacher retirements and resignations in any particular year in general; how retirements are distributed across schools; the extent to which at individual school level the number of retirements contributes to reducing a supernumerary situation in the event that the school is in an over allocation position; the extent to which any redeployment between schools reduces the supernumerary position; the incidence of awards of contracts of indefinite duration to fixed terms  teachers; the extent to which a school is able to reduce an over allocation position by terminating fixed term contracts; the number of teachers remaining in individual schools on a supernumerary  basis when the allocation and appointment processes have fully executed; the extent to which schools seek and are granted curricular concessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_17311">Taking these factors into account and while the budget measures would ultimately yield 1000 posts the yield in the 2009/10 school year was estimated at about 560. The estimates for the 2009/10 school year included provision for  320 additional posts (compared to 2008/09) and on that basis the net position was estimated at a reduction of around 240 posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_17312">The allocation of teachers at post-primary level to the end of November 2009 is showing a reduction of 504 posts compared to the position at the end of  November 2008. This indicates that the final net position will be greater than originally estimated. Allocations are continuing for special needs, language support and for projected enrolments etc. so the final position won't be known until all these posts are fully allocated.</p>
            <p eId="para_17313">The allocation at post-primary level includes 209 posts to help schools with increased enrolments in September 2009.  At primary level my Department received applications from 233 schools for developing school posts to cater for increased enrolments in September 2009. A total of 242 posts have been sanctioned for 184 of those schools which met the published criteria for developing status.</p>
            <p eId="para_17314">The Deputy will also be aware that when the Government was introducing the  moratorium in the public sector earlier this year I secured a special arrangement for education which ensured we could fill teacher and SNA posts.  The concession also provides for the filling of Principal and Deputy Principal  posts in all schools and the first allocation of posts of responsibility in new  schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_17315">More recently, the Revised Programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government. Under the revised programme there is a commitment to provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years. These posts will be allocated to the schools that are most seriously affected by the recent increase in the PTR, using objective criteria. A consultation process in relation to the allocation of these additional posts is currently underway between officials of my Department and the education partners.</p>

            <p eId="para_17693">I propose to take Questions Nos. 405 and 406 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_17694">In relation to correspondence received from various primary and post primary  schools regarding school accommodation, I can inform the Deputy that my  Department has in the order of 1,100 applications, country wide, for Major  Capital Funding.  Account is taken of both mainstream and special needs  requirements when a new school is being constructed or an existing school is  being extended.</p>
            <p eId="para_17695">Should the Deputy have concerns regarding a particular school or area I will be  glad to provide more detailed information.</p>
            <p eId="para_17696">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs (SEN).

            <p eId="para_17713">It must be emphasised that these figures were estimates.  The NCSE also  cautioned against any simplistic correlation between estimated prevalence and  resource additionality.</p>
            <p eId="para_17714">The key issue is that children with special educational needs are supported, as  necessary, through the provision of additional teachers, special needs  assistants, assistive technology, specialist equipment, special school  transport arrangements and adapted buildings.  The Deputy will be aware that  the NCSE is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at  local and national level for students with special educational needs. In  particular, its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers co-ordinate  special needs education provision at local level and arrange for the delivery  of special educational services. They act as single points of contact for  parents of students with special educational needs and for schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_17715">There are now significant supports for children with special educational needs  in our schools. This includes about 19,000 adults working solely with pupils  with special needs. There are over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) —  compared with just 300 in 1997. There are over 8,000 resource and learning  support teachers in our schools compared with just 2,000 in 1998. Over 1,000  other teachers support pupils in our special schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_17716">The Office of the Minister for Disability and Mental Health has, as a key role,  responsibility for the facilitation of the delivery of integrated health and  education support services for children with special needs. Officials of this  Office, along with my own Department, the Health Service Executive and the NCSE comprise a cross-sectoral group which meets regularly in relation to the  implementation of the EPSEN and Disability Acts. This co-ordinated approach  will ensure delivery of the most effective response for children living with  disability and special educational needs on a daily basis. The HSE will  continue to work with funded specialist providers and in co-operation with the  education sector to address the health related needs of children with special  educational needs in the context of the resources available.</p>

            <p eId="para_17720">In general, the view of my Department and the NCCA and the evidence from research in Ireland and internationally is that mixed-ability classes are preferable, particularly in the junior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_17721">It should be kept in mind that "streaming" can take different forms and that  sometimes different ability groupings may be helpful for the individual pupils  at a later stage in their education. For example various syllabi are available  at Higher, Ordinary and Foundation levels and it may be appropriate for classes  to be organised along these lines.</p>
            <p eId="para_17722">Schools have discretion in how they organise their classes, and this is essentially an organisational issue for principals and school boards of management. The School Development Planning Initiative, supported by a full time support service, has an important role in advising schools on this matter with a view to achieving the best organisational arrangement for all pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_17723">In recent talks between officials from my Department and representatives from  Educate Together, there was a wide-ranging and constructive discussion about the issues associated with Educate Together's application to become a patron at second level. The discussion also focussed on the blueprint for post-primary education published by Educate Together in June of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_17724">Educate Together's proposal not to stream students at second level was one of a wide range of issues discussed at the meeting with them. The main focus of the discussion related to the potential enrolments in any school given recognition  by the Department, the necessity to cater for as wide a range as possible of  the community served by the school and the extent of curricular range that  would be available in an Educate Together school. The purpose of raising the  issue mentioned by the Deputy was to seek clarification on how a policy of not  streaming pupils would be implemented in practice in the proposed school.</p>

The next step is to advise the education partners of the division of posts and consult with each sector on the criteria to use to allocate the posts.

            <p eId="para_17731">I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to Circulars 57/2009 and 64/2009, both of which are available on my Department's website.  Circular 57/2009 outlines the funding available through the Summer Works Scheme 2010 for water conservation measures, which will have the effect of reducing schools' water charges and of contributing to environmental sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_17732">Circular 64/2009 advises schools that data from local authorities indicates that water consumption levels in many schools remains too high. With the introduction of full metered water charges from 1 January 2010, costs may increase substantially if schools do not put in place water conservation measures. The circular details also the benefits to the school if it reduces water consumption to a recommended per capita usage of 2.1 cubic metres.</p>
            <p eId="para_17733">Schools were advised of actions they could take to reduce water consumption in Circular 46/2008, which was issued by my Department in April 2008. Schools were advised to develop a water management plan, in order that they would be familiar with the water distribution systems serving the school and the areas where water is used along with potential areas for wastage and leakage.  Practical suggestions for reducing water consumption, along with examples of best practice, were also included.</p>
            <p eId="para_17734">The Deputy will be aware that my Department, as is the case for all Government Departments, has had to identify efficiencies in all areas of its budget. Schools can play a role in that regard also by reducing their water consumption and thereby their water charges. I do not propose to provide a specific increase in capitation to take account of metered water charges. The level of  capitation grants to schools will be considered in the context of the estimates and budgetary process for 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_17737">The Bill makes provision for the transfer of responsibility for student grants to the VEC sector. In the existing budgetary situation, resources are not currently available to advance transition to new administrative arrangements in the immediate future. However, it is not possible to say definitively at this point when new administrative arrangements can be put in place and I am anxious, in light of the commitment to put all student grants on a statutory footing, to provide a statutory basis for all student grants for the intervening period. Therefore, I am endeavouring to progress to a single scheme of grants as provided for in the Bill at the earliest possible date.</p>
            <p eId="para_17738">While the current financial situation may necessitate retention of the existing administrative structures in the immediate term, I am assessing organisational options for the grants administration function in the longer run, with a view to streamlining operations and achieving more effective administrative efficiencies.  Possible options for a more significant aggregation of functions are now being explored in the context of budgetary considerations and the Government's overall programme of public service reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_17739">These developments also require consideration of a complex set of legal options in relation to further amendment of the Bill and my Department is working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to explore the issues in that regard.

            <p eId="para_17749">DEIS, the Action plan for Educational Inclusion provides for a phased implementation of the school support programme followed by a new identification process in the 2009/2010 school year.   A full review of DEIS, including a comprehensive evaluation of measures in the School Support Programme (SSP) over the period of the DEIS action plan to 2010 is also currently underway in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_17750">A Steering Group has been established within my Department to progress the technical work in preparation for a new identification process to a stage when wider consultation with relevant stakeholders on the identification method can be commenced.  On the basis of the previous identification process, there will need to be a lead-in period of at least nine months from the establishment of a new identification process to the commencement of its application.</p>
            <p eId="para_17751">In terms of the broader evaluation of DEIS, the aim is to have the outcomes of the ERC evaluations completed by mid 2010 and these are to be considered by my Department along with the relevant evaluations of practice in DEIS schools undertaken by the Inspectorate as well as relevant recent research undertaken by the ESRI and the NESF.</p>
            <p eId="para_17752">While stakeholders have been involved in consultation on the nature of the evaluations, there is also an expectation that there will be further consultation with stakeholders when the evaluations are complete with a view to the outcomes of such consultation impacting on the future of the School Support Programme.  It is not yet possible to determine when the process will be complete as this will largely depend on the outcomes of the planned consultation process.</p>

            <p eId="para_17759">The report referred to by the Deputy focused on the child literacy and social inclusion measures in DEIS — An Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  Promoting literacy and numeracy skills is already a core element of the ongoing work of schools.  National assessments of achievement in reading literacy and mathematics are conducted at two points in primary education, second class and sixth class, at approximately five-year intervals. These assessments are conducted on behalf of my Department by the Educational Research Centre and the reports of the assessments are published.</p>
            <p eId="para_17760">Promoting proficiency in literacy and numeracy is also a core objective of a range of measures under the DEIS Action Plan.  From the beginning of 2007, standardised testing in English Reading and Mathematics has been implemented on an annual basis for all pupils at two stages of the primary cycle. This work is complemented by a separate programme of national monitoring so that national trends in different categories of school can be tracked over time. Schools in the DEIS programme have already been sampled by the Educational Research Centre for this purpose, the sample of English medium schools has been undertaken this year, and Irish medium schools will be sampled in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_17761">Given the central role of assessment in guiding students' learning, Guidelines on Assessment developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment were published in October 2007 and issued to all teachers to assist schools in developing and implementing a policy on assessment practice in classrooms. The Council has also developed standardised templates for reporting to parents on children's learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_17762">Literacy and numeracy also form a key element of second chance education and training programmes for those with low levels of skill. New awards in this area have been developed at Levels 1 and 2 in the National Framework of Qualifications.  Having regard to the above, I will consider the recommendation to develop a separate National Literacy Policy Framework in the light of the outcomes of the review of the implementation of DEIS measures and of the assessment programmes currently underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_17763">In relation to English for speakers of foreign languages, my Department provides for English language training for adult immigrants (English for Speakers of Other Languages, ESOL) through the adult literacy budget. Funds are allocated to VECs who are the main statutory providers of ESOL tuition. The disbursement of funds is a matter for each VEC which, subject to its budget, decides the nature and extent of the adult literacy and ESOL classes to be provided in its area. The organisation and location of classes are also matters for decision by the VECs.</p>
            <p eId="para_17764">An independent review was commissioned to assist in the development of a national English language training policy and framework for legally-resident adult immigrants based on extensive stakeholder consultation. The report in this regard is under consideration by the Minister for Integration.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_17766">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS, was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate. The ERC's overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage set out in the Education Act (1998), as: ". . . the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools".</p>
            <p eId="para_17767">It is recognised that the majority of schools in Ireland may include among their pupils, children with disadvantaged backgrounds. In general most schools are equipped to support the individual needs of children with disadvantaged backgrounds without recourse to supplementary targeted resources. However, evidence has shown that when disadvantage levels are found in significant concentrations that schools will require additional supports to supplement their efforts to address the educational needs of all their pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_17768">The main focus of the Social Inclusion measures in my Department will be to retain resources in DEIS schools. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_17769">I can assure the Deputy that following the next review of DEIS, schools which successfully use supports to achieve better outcomes for their pupils will continue to be included in DEIS provided the levels of disadvantage of their pupil cohorts continue to justify such supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_17774">The ICT Strategy Group Report, "Investing Effectively in ICT in Schools" which was published in July 2008, provides a clear direction to inform actions to further the integration of ICT into teaching and learning in our schools. The Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, Building Ireland's Smart Economy, re-iterates Government policy to enhance the role of ICT in the education system, working in partnership with industry, to invest further in the provision of equipment and connectivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_17775">Earlier this year, I set up the Joint Advisory Group, comprising members of ICT Ireland, the Telecommunications and Internet Federation, the Irish Software Association, the Department of Education and Science and the National Centre for Technology in Education, to explore how best to do this having regard to the recommendations set out in the Strategy Group Report.   This Joint Advisory Group, which commenced its work in March this year, signifies a strong partnership between industry and the education sector, with the shared objective of supporting children's development potential by enhancing the role of ICT in the education system.  The Group's Report was launched by An Taoiseach on 16 November last and its recommendations mainly centre around the areas of  the foundations for future ICT infrastructure, implementing sound technology principles, professional development for teachers, availability of digital content, enhancement of broadband connectivity, embracing core teaching principles, and ICT planning in school management.  The Report also looks at procurement and financial models for approaching future investment in ICT.</p>
            <p eId="para_17776">Some of the main recommendations include: the establishment of an ICT in Schools Steering Group to oversee the  implementation of the recommendations in the report; a teaching computer is deployed in every classroom in 2009/2010, along with a digital projector; school servers are enhanced, where necessary, and that schools deploy or upgrade LANs (Local Area Networks) to deliver improved security and connectivity, ease of administration and file and print sharing during 2010 and 2011; a minimum of five learning computers be deployed in each classroom over the next three years (2010-2012); the Department seeks to reduce the variety of equipment deployed, by centralising the expenditure of the Department's ICT funding and by providing  strong guidelines and incentives for the expenditure of schools' own funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_17777">Where viable, industry makes available professional development opportunities for teachers and that these opportunities are promoted via a central resource. Industry should also make available, where relevant and feasible, in-company training for use by teachers.  The NCTE, the technology sector and the education publishers should explore the development of world class digital educational content. There should be an increased focus on the creation of digital content for students with special educational needs and a national learning environment made available to schools and teachers. This network, also referred to as a virtual learning environment (VLE), would provide opportunities for schools to develop online.</p>
            <p eId="para_17778">I believe the advisory group's recommendations are relevant in the context of implementing the approach outlined in the Strategy Report "Investing Effectively in ICT in Schools" on how to realise the potential of ICT use in schools.  I am committed to making funding available for ICT in schools over the next three years.   The issuing of grants to Primary schools this week is a first step in that commitment and I have agreed that priority should be given to ensuring that there is a teaching computer and digital projector in every classroom.</p>
            <p eId="para_17779">As noted above the report has also recommended that I establish a steering group to drive the implementation of the recommendations in the report.   I have asked Paul Rellis of Microsoft Ireland to chair the group and I will be seeking nominations from other stakeholders in the coming weeks. This Steering Group will oversee the implementation of further recommendations.</p>
