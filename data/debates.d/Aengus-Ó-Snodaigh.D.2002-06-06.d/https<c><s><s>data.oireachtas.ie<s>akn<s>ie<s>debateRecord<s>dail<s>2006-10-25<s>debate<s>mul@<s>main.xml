          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">All over the country people are out fundraising for vital life-saving equipment.  They are running marathons, holding coffee mornings and doing trick-or-treat campaigns.  It is only a short time since John Aldridge took up what he called singing to raise money for a CAT scanner in Temple Street children's hospital.  The purpose of his efforts was to provide a piece of equipment that would prevent children with serious head injuries from having to be moved to Beaumont or the Mater.  People do such things because the Government is not providing money for the required priorities, so where is the €13 billion expenditure on health going?</p>
          <p eId="para_2">It is just over a year since I exposed to the House the financial disaster known as the PPARS project.  I remind the Taoiseach that €144 million of people's hard-earned money went down the tubes in a system that underpays and misspends.  It does everything except what it is supposed to do.  In response to that matter, the Taoiseach said he would freeze the project, stop the rot and halt the waste.  Neither the Taoiseach nor his Government did that, however.  The Dáil was misled about that matter because he did not stop the project, nor did he stop the waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have a copy of the Astron Consulting report, which was published in September this year.  The report, which is a fundamental review of the PPARS project review, is worth reading.  It does not need any sexing up because its findings are so stark.  The report's conclusions are that the PPARS project was "badly conceived" and "poorly implemented".  It also states that "the system is not stable yet" and "reflects the old (health board) structure".  In addition, it states that "the ongoing costs are very high".  This year, the Government spent over €21 million——</p>

          <p eId="para_5">——and it is proposed to do the same again next year.  An even bigger shock is the report's finding that, from the start, the project's governance has not been strong.  Since the pause, which was last October, "overall project governance appears to have gone".  It has gone like the money and nobody is in charge.  Nobody is responsible for the disappearance of €21 million down this black hole.  Is this the financial engineering of which the Minister for Finance spoke?</p>

          <p eId="para_7">The final conclusion of this consultants' report is that PPARS might become a "never ending project".  A year ago, the Taoiseach told us that he would stop the waste, stop the rot and see that the people's money was saved.  What does he propose to do about it now in light of the Astron Consulting report?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_8">We are spending almost €13 billion on the health service, a major proportion of which is going into new developments every year.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_10">Large amounts of that expenditure are going into projects to improve the quality of service for the public at every level.  That is not to take away from the efforts of those engaged in charitable fundraising acts, which have always happened in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">The PPARS system has been implemented in six Health Service Executive areas so I am surprised that Deputy Kenny is asking us to stop it.  To unravel it in those areas would waste money that is effectively working.  It is supporting the human resource records for 70,000 staff on the payroll and a large amount of other projects in those Health Service Executive areas.  As I said last year, the further roll-out of the scheme, other than in the six areas where it is working, is on hold.  It currently remains on hold and no further work has taken place in those areas.  The review carried out by the HSE since October 2005 concluded, first, that no long-term strategy should be adopted until the use of the system in existing sites is maximised and fully operational.  That is what they are concentrating on.  Second, the review concluded that the requirements of the new unified HSE structure should be clarified and that the PPARS project's capacity to fulfil these requirements should be verified.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">Deputy Kenny will recall that the HSE did not exist when the PPARS project began.  When the HSE started, therefore, one had to take account of the new structure, which is only in its second year.  That work will take place over the next eight to nine months, led by the HSE's national director of services.  That person is responsible for co-ordinating the activity and is implementing the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">Sanction is pending for a capital cost of €2.844 million sought by the HSE for this year.  No sanction has yet been agreed by the Department so no allocation has been sanctioned this year.  Deputy Kenny mentioned a figure of €21 million but the overall cost estimate for the project in 2006 is €4.31 million, which is a recurring cost for the system as it is operating, including software, system-hosting and payroll support.  There is a figure of €15.18 million for HSE staff and technical consultancy staff.  These costs will continue to reduce as the system beds in.  Unfortunately, we have not found a way of bringing in a new system that does not involve staff, and they must be paid.  There is also a once-off cost of €1.55 million for hardware and consultancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">Like all large organisations, the HSE requires comprehensive human resource support and payroll systems.  Like other sectors, the HSE could not cover the entire country without using modern technological systems.  There have been difficulties with the PPARS system, as there have been with IT systems all over the world.  However, it is unreasonable for Deputy Kenny to ask the HSE not to continue to bed down the new system.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_15">That is the usual answer given by the Taoiseach on these matters.  I am not sure whether the Taoiseach has been briefed on the four additional factors set out in the report, namely that there was no clear demand from management for the system and that management support was weak and has become weaker since the pause; substantial variations existed in pay and conditions, organisational structures, cultures and processes among agencies, the extent of which was not known before the commencement of the project; there was an inability to definitively freeze the business blueprints or requirements at any particular point in time; and there was a failure to comprehensively follow through on the pilot site implementation strategy before rolling it out throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">In terms of incompetence, the same applies in every other issue for which this Government is responsible.  Last year, the Government spent €21 million on this project.  This morning I listened to Fr. Peter McVerry, who said that young offenders were being allowed to rot in a warehouse and that literacy programmes were being cut in our prisons.  This money could have supplied 100 public health nurses, while €20 million could buy 1 million hours of home help.  A nine-bed intensive care unit could be built for only €2.5 million.  The Taoiseach could have given a CAT scanner to Temple Street Hospital, in his constituency.  A dialysis machine costs €35,000 and a mobile x-ray unit costs €40,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Nobody is in charge over there and the Astron report of September clearly points out what we predicted last year with regard to the PPARS project.  Nobody is responsible, nobody is in charge and money is disappearing down the tube.  Will the Taoiseach tell the Dáil today what he proposes to do about this?  Who is in charge of this project?  The Astron report states that there is no governance and nobody is in charge or responsible.  Where is the Minister for Health and Children or the HSE while this Government is continuing to wilfully squander the people's taxes?  What does the Taoiseach propose to do?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_10">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_18">I have already stated who is in charge of the programme, namely the national director of shared services.  Deputy Kenny can quote from the report but I will give a more balanced interpretation.  The Astron report states that PPARS is working quite well in some areas but that overall disappointment exists at what is being delivered.  That is what I said one year ago.  It confirms that any further roll-out decision is on hold and recommends that it should be based on the new HSE structure, which is now 20 months old.  We all agree with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">The report goes on to state that this would have to be with the support and participation of senior management, which is obvious, and that complexity surrounding staff terms and conditions would have to be removed.  We all know that the old health board system had a variety of health boards around the country in which people worked under differing terms, conditions, contracts and work practices.  That was the reason we decided, in 2001, to introduce a unified health system, the Health Service Executive, which has come into effect and is working successfully — although in a difficult position — towards implementing a policy on the more than 100,000 health service staff who are working hard throughout the country.  The report states that it is difficult to identify realised cost savings in sites where the system has been implemented but that project staff levels were reduced from approximately 500 to 254 by May, and it gives the cost of the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">The report's recommendations are that a long-term plan is required by the HSE, that as a first step, the HSE should stabilise the system in existing life sites and that we should address issues, including complexity, arising from variations in terms and conditions.  That is why we set up the HSE.  The report goes on to advise that we should improve ownership and governance.  I have already stated that responsibility for this is with the national director of shared services for the health board.  The report also recommends that we should have more management and information needs, identify requirements for transfer to shared services and agree steps for a transition to a single integrated HSE structure.  That is precisely what is happening.  In referring to the issues raised in the report, Deputy Kenny stopped when it came to the recommendations.  They are in the same report and, if the Deputy turns over the page, he can read them.  That is what is happening.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_32">I want to raise the case of the separated mother of two who faces the prospect of having €500,000 in costs pursued against her by the State in respect of a damages action she took over the sexual abuse she suffered while attending primary school.  Deputies will recall that the principal of the school concerned was jailed after being found guilty of 21 charges of indecent assault from a sample of 380 counts relating to 21 girls.  The State successfully sought to deny liability for the actions of the teacher, even though he was employed by the State.  We now have a situation in which the woman, who was described by Mr. Justice de Valera as having suffered catastrophic injuries as a result of the unforgivable actions of a teacher, faces the seizure of her only asset, the family home.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">This should be contrasted with the issue I raised yesterday with the Taoiseach regarding the more than €1,300 million in compensation paid out by the Government for the abuse of young people in residential institutions.  The Taoiseach will recall that the State voluntarily agreed to pick up the charges and costs in cases to which it was not and could not have been a party.  When I asked the Taoiseach why this decision was made, he said: "The Irish church does not have those resources."  He also said he makes no apology for spending €1,300 million in taxpayers' money on discharging this liability when the State was not a party and could not have been made a party because the church did not have the resources.  What about the woman who does not have resources, who was sexually abused and suffered catastrophic injuries and who now faces the seizure of her home to discharge costs of €500,000 because the State will not admit liability?  By claiming the teacher was not its agent, the State pleaded successfully that it did not have liability and it is now pursuing the woman for the charges.  Should not the same conditions be applied to that woman out of compassion as those applied in respect of the sloppy, secret and negligent deal conducted through Deputy Woods which the Taoiseach tried to justify?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_23">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_34">I will address both issues.  Obviously, I cannot comment on the circumstances of a case that is before the Supreme Court but, when the case concluded in the High Court last March, I made it clear that the Government had asked the State Claims Agency — the statutory body which deals with legal fees — to approach the issue of costs in a measured and sensitive way.  The woman lost her case in the High Court and, because there was a large bill, I said we would do that.  I understand the State Claims Agency told the lady's solicitor on the record at an early meeting that while some arrangements would have to made regarding costs there was no question whatsoever of her losing her house — so that does not arise.  However, the lady's solicitor informed the agency that she intended to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, so obviously I could not go any further.  If she did not want us to deal sympathetically and in a measured way with the issue at the end of the High Court case, but wished to proceed to the Supreme Court, as was her right, then I could do nothing.  In any case the High Court has put a stay on the costs pending the termination of the Supreme Court appeal, so I can go no further in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">On the second issue raised by the Deputy, 14,000 applications have been made by people in residential institutions to the redress board.  These are vulnerable people who were in institutions, either sent there by the State or under joint authority by the State, which was jointly responsible.  When seven years ago I gave the apology for how these people were treated, because their lives were ruined and destroyed, we said we would set up a redress board — the numbers have increased from the originally envisaged 6,500 to 7,000 cases — and to give these people awards of court.  This was the right and humane thing to do.  The State would have had to pay for these charges.  In our view the State was responsible.  They were State institutions or institutions run by religious to which the State sent these people.  The State, in our view, is liable for that.  The figures are higher, but we will not stop half way down and state we cannot pay the people involved.  There was the deadline of last December which showed that we would have cumulative average awards of approximately €76,000 and legal and administrative costs of approximately 20%.  We have paid those costs.  I make no apology for paying those people to whom I made an apology and for whom we set up a redress system.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">That is not the issue.  The issue is that if the Taoiseach sent out Deputy Woods to do this secret deal because the church did not have the resources, why does the same principle not apply in this case?  In reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy O'Sullivan, who raised the issue after the Taoiseach made his remarks about the measured response, the nice Minister for Education and Science replied as follows.  This was in the case of the mother of two facing the costs of €500,000 and the loss of her home.  The bossy Minister for Education and Science said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_37">The State has a responsibility to the taxpayer to fight cases where it knows it has a strong defence.  In that context, it is also natural to seek an order for costs when it successfully defends a case.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">That was the formal considered response written for her by her departmental officials and parroted faithfully here by the nice Minister for Education and Science after the Taoiseach's measured words.</p>

However, here we have a circumstance where the Taoiseach believes on the one hand an organisation can cap its liability at £100 million for people abused in residential institutions with the State picking up the remaining €1.2 billion, while on the other hand in a case involving an individual citizen where the principal was jailed for sexual abuse——</p>

I am not responsible for the lady pursuing the case to the Supreme Court — that is her right, so I have no comment to make about that.  However, when the issue arose following her High Court case I made it very clear on the record of this House that we had asked the State Claims Agency, the statutory body that deals with these cases, to approach the issues of costs in a measured and sensitive way.  The issue today was that she would lose her house.  I was putting on the record that the lady was told last spring on the record at a very early meeting that arrangements would have to be made regarding costs because she lost her case.  There was no question whatsoever of her losing her house.  The solicitor came back to advise that she would go to the Supreme Court, as is her right, so I cannot get involved.  As I said, the High Court has put a stay on the costs order anyway, so the issue does not arise until the end of the Supreme Court stage.  However, the house issue does not arise at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">While I know the Deputy knows the answer, to avoid confusion let me say the State was liable jointly for children it took into care and that was the point.  We were liable for that.  If we were going to apologise to them, say we would compensate them and set up a redress board for them, the ultimate number was a matter for the independent redress board to look at the cases and decide whether we were liable and it was for us to pay them the costs.

          <p eId="para_58">One of the worst inflationary pressures on individuals and families relates to house prices.  The gap has widened hugely between personal disposable income and the price of a house, and is now at a ratio of 11:1.  Will the Taoiseach take any corrective action on the matter?  We have heard a number of announcements from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and the Tánaiste all saying different things.  The Taoiseach is on the record as saying people should buy, and would be foolish not to buy and listen to the naysayers as he calls them, although others might call them experts.  Effectively the Taoiseach is talking up the housing market with his comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">The Tánaiste has said the Government would abolish stamp duty, which has had a knock-on effect — he suggested the Government has so much money that it does not know what to do with it.  The Minister for Finance said he would not interfere, despite all the property tax breaks that have certainly interfered with the market over the years.  Will the Taoiseach make a clear statement of Government policy on the matter that will address the problems people are facing rather than having this Dutch auction politics, in which even Fine Gael has involved itself, trying to undercut each other with policies on stamp duty?  Nothing will be done about house prices as a result of that.  Any auctioneer will advise that there is a stalling of the market as it waits to ascertain whether any of these things will happen.  Over the past two years my colleague, Deputy Boyle, the Green Party's finance spokesperson, has proposed targeted reforms to the stamp duty regime that would benefit older persons who wish to downsize — they should be facilitated — and people with disabilities who need to move house for accessibility reasons.</p>

Stamp duty applies to a range of property and other transactions, as Deputy Sargent knows.  These include residential and commercial transactions and also share dealings and bank levies.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">The yield from stamp duty last year was in the region of €2.7 billion.  The source of revenue makes a significant contribution to investment in public services, including health care and education.  There is no stamp duty chargeable on owner-occupiers of new houses with a floor area less than 125 sq. m.  First-time owner-occupiers are treated more favourably owing to changes the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, made some years ago.  When it comes to purchasing second-hand properties, they are exempt from stamp duty on houses worth up to €317,500 and they benefit from reduced rates on houses worth up to €635,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">Approximately one third of all stamp duty comes from residential property — that is all.  Recent comments, while not made by Deputy Sargent, imply that it all comes from residential property.</p>

It is estimated that, in the current year, only €70 million of stamp duty, out of a total yield of €2.7 billion, will be from first-time buyers.  The Government is always prepared to listen to arguments and debates but one should note that over one third of stamp duty on houses is derived from the more expensive upper end of the market.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">Most of the Taoiseach's reply, which alluded to building more houses, is probably good news for Paddy the Plasterer but it is not very good news for many house buyers.  The reality is that the thresholds are meaningless in many parts of Dublin.  One will not get a house for less than the thresholds.  I understand the stamp duty take for this year is approximately €70 million in excess of expectations.  The Government is raking it in.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">About four months ago, I asked the Taoiseach about a similar matter, that is, the famous Report of the Committee on the Price of Building Land, which cost 27.5p in 1973.  The committee reported to the then Minister for Local Government.  The report was reviewed by the all-party committee in April 2004 and was still found to be necessary.  I asked the Taoiseach about it because land prices comprise approximately 45% or 50% of house prices in the Dublin area.  Basically builders are walking away with approximately €250,000 before foundations are even laid.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">Will the Taoiseach do anything about this matter?  When I asked him about it, he said he was and still is in favour of the Kenny report.  I asked about the legislation and he said it was being drafted, that he was pressing to get on with it and that he did not agree with me.  He said he would try to address the matter over the summer and that he was giving me a serious answer to a serious question.  How serious was his answer?  The summer is gone and we are still trying to deal with the difficulty posed by house prices.  Will he implement properly the recommendations of which he stated he was in favour?</p>

          <p eId="para_82">A number of points arise and there is no point in my going back over the stamp duty issues.  On the Deputy's point that we are accruing far more than expected from stamp duty, I was pointing out where it comes from.  It is not simply derived from residential property but from a range of sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">The resources that accrue from stamp duty are used.  Every year, we invest approximately €1 billion more in health care.  We have invested €500 million in the capital programme for first and second level schools and the welfare package for this year amounted to €1 billion.</p>

            <p eId="para_99">Thirty-nine staff serving in my Department have applied through the central applications facility to relocate under the decentralisation programme.  The breakdown by grade is: assistant principal officer, seven; higher executive officer, three; administrative officer, seven; executive officer, nine; staff officer, two; and clerical officer, 11.  Ten former members of staff have already been assigned to decentralised posts.</p>

            <p eId="para_101">That 18% of the staff of my Department have opted to relocate outside Dublin shows that the underlying decision to initiate a comprehensive decentralisation programme was the correct one.  Deputies will be aware that there are no proposals to decentralise my Department or any of the bodies under its aegis.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">Of the 213 staff in my Department, 39 have applied to decentralise.  They include seven assistant principal officers, three higher executive officers, nine executive officers, two staff officers and 11 clerical officers.  Ten former members of staff have already been assigned to decentralised posts.  The total number of officials is 49 — ten officials have already moved and a further 39 officials are listed.  They will go to a range of places.  I do not have the exact numbers for each of the agencies.  Some have applied to be transferred to Ordnance Survey Ireland in Dungarvan, the National Standards Authority of Ireland in Arklow, the probation and welfare service in Navan, the National Roads Authority in Ballinasloe, the National Educational Welfare Board in Portarlington, Development Co-operation Ireland in Limerick, Sustainable Energy Ireland in Dundalk, the Garda headquarters in Thurles, Area Development Management Limited in Clifden, the Valuation Office in Youghal and the Prison Service in Longford.  In most of the cases I know of, having spoken to the individuals in question, it seems that people decided to apply for decentralisation to get near home or to go back to their roots.  Their motivation usually relates to such concerns rather than to the individual offices.  People want to get away from Dublin and get back home.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">The staff numbers will be the same, although we have to achieve a small reduction every year.  Under the Department of Finance's guidelines, we have to try to achieve a 3% reduction every year over a three-year period.  I am sure that approach will continue into the future.  For the past two years, departmental officials who want to participate in the decentralisation programme have been moving into posts in agencies and Departments which are to be moved.  People who have decided to stay in Dublin — they may be from Dublin or elsewhere — have usually made such decisions based on their age and the ages of their family members.  Such people are filling the posts which are being vacated.  These changes are taking place in the public service in an organised way.  Some people might argue that the pace of change is slow, but it is not possible to do it in any other way with the staff associations.  People are leaving jobs which are not due to be decentralised.  Some positions in the Department of the Taoiseach will not be decentralised, although jobs in two areas will be moved to new locations.  People in other agencies who do not want to move from Dublin are filling positions in my Department.  The programme is working on an organised basis and will continue to do so over a period of time.  I understand that approximately 1,000 people are already on the move.  That number will increase progressively over a number of years.</p>

            <p eId="para_107">The Taoiseach told us in February of this year that his Department would lose approximately 20% of its staff as a result of decentralisation.  He said that the problems resulting from those changes would be eased by means of the redeployment and retraining of current staff.  How will that procedure be put in place?  What procedures are in place for that retraining and redeployment?  Given that it seems fairly extensive, has the Department taken account of a cost for it?  The Taoiseach indicated in February that 45 staff in his Department had opted to relocate.  Will those people be moved over the long term?  Will those changes happen at a certain pace?  Does the Taoiseach expect them to be moved in advance of the forthcoming general election?</p>

            <p eId="para_108">I said on a previous occasion that 45 officials in my Department had applied for decentralisation — that figure has since increased to 49.  Ten members of staff have moved on and the others are in the system.  The restructuring process under the central applications facility is ongoing.  I assure the Deputy that civil servants are not worried about the election because they will still be there on the other side of it, regardless of who else is there.  The movement of staff within and between Departments and offices is taking place at a steady pace.  Approximately 2,300 officials have been assigned to posts which will be decentralised.  That represents approximately 30% of the total number of jobs to be relocated.  It is moving progressively.  It will not be as quick as we intended it to be.  It will be like the programme in the 1990s, when approximately 4,500 people were decentralised more slowly than was anticipated.  It is moving.  I understand that contracts are being agreed for the 39 buildings and structures which are to be built at the various locations.  As people notice what is happening, such as the completion of the physical infrastructure, they will be more inclined to join the panel.  It is certainly moving.  Hardly a week or month goes by without somebody moving, as one can tell by the extent of staff movement in one's own Department.</p>

It will not be delivered.  It is damaging the Civil Service.  It is duplicating buildings.  It is creating a parallel Civil Service.  Does the Taoiseach agree that we should go back to the drawing board for a negotiated and planned programme of voluntary decentralisation?</p>

            <p eId="para_119">The things mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte are happening in my Department.  Progress is being made with the central applications facility and in the discussions with the staff associations.  My Department and all other Departments and agencies are working their way through the system.  It will be slower than we anticipated.  That has to be the case because the programme is voluntary.  We are working our way through the system.  I would not say it is a failure in the Department of the Taoiseach, or that it is not working there.  We have moved to a position where it is working.  Some 20% of the staff of my Department will move under the decentralisation programme.  That is a high number, on any base.  That almost 50 people, from just over 200 people, are prepared to relocate demonstrates that it is working.  I concede that it is slower than we hoped, but there are many reasons for that.  Some of the reasons are good and some of them are not so good.  We have to provide for retraining and give people opportunities in areas like technology.  I do not think it affects the service in any way.  When I deal with a range of Departments which are involved in the decentralisation programme, there are no great difficulties.  It will be even less of a problem as technology improves and advances.</p>

            <p eId="para_121">Many of the buildings which are held by the OPW are also on saleable leases.  If Departments move, including some Departments near here, they can sell on some very lucrative contracts.  We need to consider what the bottom line figure for that will be in five or ten years time.  One can receive far better offers throughout the country, as we all know.  Some of the buildings which are held are quite expensive.  I do not refer to the old traditional buildings, but to buildings which have been leased and rented by the OPW.  We have to take that into the equation.  I am not certain about the ESRI.  If we are to have balanced regional development, we need to stop the growth of Dublin over the next 20 or 25 years.  I think Deputy Rabbitte will agree that we do not want to have 2 million people, from a total population of 5 million, living in Dublin.  I do not suggest that decentralisation will bring an end to all of these problems — I am not making that argument.  We must ensure Dublin city is not crippled by its population.  This does not happen in other countries.  Balanced regional development means the State has a role to play in moving people and industry to the regions in every possible way and we must be aggressive in doing so.  The 10,000 people represent a small part because, even if they went tomorrow, they are only 10,000 out of 4.3 million people.  We must stop the strangulation of the Dublin area which is neither good for Dublin nor the rest of the country.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_129">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">The benchmarking phases were implemented in my Department with 25% of the increase from 1 December 2001 paid in June 2003. The total cost to December 2003 was approximately €405,000.  A further 50% of the increase was paid from 1 January 2004 at an approximate cost of €491,000 for that year and the final 25% of the increase was paid from 1 June 2005 at an approximate cost of €150,000 for that year.  The full year cost of the increases, in total, is estimated at €800,000 for 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">Under the terms of Sustaining Progress, the pay increases recommended by the Public Service Benchmarking Body were conditional on delivery of real and verifiable outputs in relation to modernisation and flexibility.  The key mechanisms for monitoring overall progress in this regard were the reports on action plans prepared by individual Departments and offices, a general review by the Department of Finance and verification by the Civil Service performance verification group.  The group concluded that the progress achieved warranted payment to the grades concerned in my Department.</p>

            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_132">Over the past five years the Government has recruited almost 40,000 extra staff and paid around €1.3 billion through the benchmarking process.  This includes the Department of the Taoiseach where, I understand, legal staff has doubled and communications staff has increased by 55%.  The Taoiseach's Department will spend €143 million more this year than when he came to office and most of that is related to salaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">The Taoiseach refers to real and verifiable outputs and suggests the basis for determining these lay in the action plans produced by each Department and assessed by the Civil Service performance verification group.  Regarding benchmarking payments in the Taoiseach's Department, what were the three priority outputs that were to be achieved under the benchmarking programme?  What are the three essential differences people can see in the Department relating to increased efficiency and better public service?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_93">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_134">Everyone had to put forward a plan and the plan I submitted relating to my Department covered four broad areas on which management and staff collaborated.  Those areas were human resource management, financial management, quality customer service and technological innovation.  More competitive promotion processes were introduced while the performance management and development system, PMDS, relating to the management of performance in the civil service was implemented.  There was a central timeframe.  The process related to training and to implementing the guidelines set down by the Department of Finance regarding performance management and lowering staff levels in the Department by 2% through individuals taking on new roles and functions and integrating sections.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">The Department introduced a new financial management system, the Oracle programme, designed to give more information and control.  It deals with costs and inputs and allows for more transparency such as allocating cost heads to individuals.  People in the Department are now able to identify where money is going, not only to sections but to individuals.  This programme has been fully implemented in the Department and allows for much better monthly reporting than previously.  It fits in with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and so on.  The method of reporting achieved is far better as it is meaningful for individual sections in that they can see areas for which they are responsible.  It has improved efficiency and service.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">A customer charter was developed, as was the case in other Departments.  Annual customer surveys are now conducted to measure the Department's performance against commitments made in the charter.  Those who use the Department are given a questionnaire seeking opinions on service and everything from time calls to memorandums.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">The e-Cabinet project is an innovative system, electronically supported, and enabling the administrative process associated with the preparation for and conduct of Government business.  The Department has won awards for this system.  It was mainly implemented by civil servants with some outside expertise.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">These are some of the advances made in the Department which were put forward to the verification group and are now fully implemented.</p>

            <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_139">Will the systems of performance measurement in operation in the Taoiseach's Department change in advance of the next round of benchmarking?  Is the Taoiseach planning any initiatives to award top performers in his Department?  Are his special advisers covered by benchmarking in the same way as other staff in the Department?  There is a particular issue regarding contract workers and benchmarking.  There is often short notice — one could almost say no notice — given on the expiry or renewal of contracts.  Given that many of the people involved are parents and have other responsibilities, is it possible to determine whether benchmarking can cover contract workers in the Department of the Taoiseach?  Can better notice be given regarding the expiry of contracts?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_95">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_140">I will examine that.  Currently, contract workers are not really in the system.  Like advisers, they operate on a different contract basis.  If one was a contract worker for a number of years, one would fall considerably behind his or her benchmarked colleagues.</p>
            <p eId="para_141">The Department's management group is examining the initiatives it would like to have included in the Civil Service performance verification group's deliberations in the next round.  This would include extending it into e-Cabinet and Cabinet sub-committees.  The Cabinet element and movement within Departments have been well bedded down.  However, they are examining other extensions that are three years away.  Issues ranging from the knowledge society to dealing with EU business have been raised in the customer surveys.  There are other areas where Departments see potential for further modernisation.  There are also regular circulars on modernisation issued by the Department of Finance to other Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">No decision has yet been made on the operation of bonus payments for civil servants, but it is an issue.  In the last round of benchmarking, those who prepared the report stated that the issue of bonuses should be examined and the Government should take a view on it.  It is a difficult issue to deal with and it was not dealt with in the last round.  I am in favour of it in principle, but we need to examine how it can work best.  If senior officials within one Department were to receive bonus payments, what does it say about senior officials in another Department?  Perhaps the former were dealing with hotter political issues or more difficult legislation.  Those are some of the problems that arise.  On the other hand, it is somewhat unfair if an able individual is out-performing his or her colleagues, yet only gets paid the same as everybody else.  The practice in industry is fairer in that if one is a top performer, one will be in line for bonuses.  It is not an unreasonable position.  Because the whole theory of benchmarking is based on the comparison between industry and the public service, the issue of bonuses is one that needs to be addressed.  While I do not have the answer as to how this can be done, it requires further examination.</p>

            <p eId="para_149">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 13, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">Progress on the implementation of the Government programme is kept constantly under review.  Deputies will be aware that for every full year that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have been in government, we have published an annual progress report which sets out the progress to date in implementing every commitment contained within the programme for Government.  The last edition of the Government progress report was published in the summer of 2005.  It is our intention to publish a further report in early 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">It is the responsibility of each individual Minister to ensure that the commitments in the programme that fall within his or her particular portfolio are fully implemented.  The Department of the Taoiseach derives its mandate from my role as head of Government.  As such, it is involved to some degree in virtually all aspects of the work of Government.  It provides support to me as Taoiseach and to the Government through the Government secretariat, the Cabinet committee system and through its involvement in key policy areas and initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">The current key strategic priorities of the Department are set out in its strategy statement.  They include Northern Ireland, EU and international affairs, economic and social policy, social partnership, public service modernisation and the information society and e-government.  I and the Ministers of State in my Department answer questions in the House on these issues.  In all its work, my Department works closely with other Departments and offices.  Individual Ministers are of course answerable to the House in respect of their own specific areas of responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">The key areas for which my Department is responsible in terms of An Agreed Programme for Government can be broadly summarised as follows: supporting the development and implementation of social partnership, working with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to achieve the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects, co-ordinating the e-government initiative to bring about an expansion in the range and quality of on-line Government services and ensuring that Ireland's key objectives in the European Union are carried forward in the context of my role as a member of the European Council.</p>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_114">
            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_172">You are trying to influence the Taoiseach's response.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_115">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_173">May I give a general response, a Cheann Chomhairle, without going into detail?  We have substantially reduced class sizes and the pupil-teacher ratio.  We have transformed the learning environment for those with special needs and have launched major initiatives to tackle educational disadvantage.  We have put resources into all communities.  There are thousands of extra teachers and teaching assistants.  We have reduced the pupil-teacher ratio far below the norm in disadvantaged areas.  This was a policy objective.  We believed we should put teachers into schools in disadvantaged communities and it has worked successfully.  One may say that this should be done across the board in a way that does not affect disadvantaged schools, but class sizes in most disadvantaged areas are now 15 and under.  That was the right thing to do.  It does not mean that we will not continue to reduce class sizes in other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">On the medical card issue, not alone have we increased the numbers significantly but when people are working there is not the same demand for medical cards, although we also moved to a net pay basis, changing all the criteria.  That was done with the medical cards system before we introduced the doctor-only cards.  It is interesting that has not achieved the forecast numbers because income levels are far higher than the numbers based on the CSO figures a few years ago.  If they were not, they would have claimed those cards.  There have been three advertising campaigns for doctor-only medical cards but they still have not achieved the figures forecast.</p>
            <p eId="para_175">We have returned more than €5 billion to the people in tax reductions.  We have cut the standard rate and continue to make progress on the 18% rate but the important things were to improve the entry point system, which is now €200, which we said we would do, and to remove minimum pay from the tax net.  There are approximately 750,000 people who are not eligible for tax at all as against 350,000 seven years ago.  The 80:20 issue has not been achieved but the targeted measures to help single people, married couples, those with families, people with low incomes and those on the minimum wage were more important objectives.</p>

            <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_176">In the Taoiseach's main reply, he stated it was the responsibility of the individual Minister to oversee the implementation of specific commitments in the programme for Government.  Has the Taoiseach seen any situation arising across his Department's areas of responsibility where commitments in the programme for Government have been diluted, torn up or shredded by other agencies entrusted to carry out the commitments made by his Department in that programme?  To illustrate the point, I instanced the commitment under the health portfolio to create 3,000 additional public hospital beds.  Professor Drumm of the HSE has stated that these are not needed and will not be pursued.  Has the Taoiseach seen that situation apply under his Department's aegis?  What will the Taoiseach do about the specific instance I have cited?</p>
            <p eId="para_177">As it falls to the Taoiseach's Department to anchor same, will he advise us why it was decided not to publish an annual progress report on the implementation of the programme for Government this year, as has happened each year since 2002?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_178">I hope no one shreds any of the initiatives or proposals from my Department but from time to time people would have a different means or timescale for implementing them.  That is always an issue we must try to resolve.  The timescales and formats are not always as we set out in the programme for Government; that is part of the system we must engage with.  We did an annual audit to keep things under review, to keep a focus and maintain a pressure on trying as far as we could, and we do this for a high proportion of our commitments, to implement them fully or as nearly as we could.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">We did not publish the review this year because we are coming to the end of the programme for Government and we decided to go to the end of 2006 before publishing.  Obviously there would not be much point in publishing the programme in August next year because at that stage the life of the current Government will be over.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_181">The view of the management of the HSE is that 3,000 beds are not required.  Its view is that the utilisation of existing beds, plus the 1,300 new beds that have been delivered by this Government and 450 that are planned, should, with better utilisation and more day cases, fulfil the need.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">When we were talking about 3,000 beds we were not talking about day cases being where they are now — there are 500,000 such cases per year.  At the time, in 1999 to 2000, when the survey took place, there were fewer than 100,000 day cases.  The HSE management's argument is that because day cases are being used to this extent, the formulation of figures that gave the 3,000 is not required.  This is the international trend, with the utilisation of day cases, more flexible working and more use of technology giving the turnover that means that level of beds is not required.</p>

            <p eId="para_184">The Government's environmental commitments clearly state that it will implement greenhouse gas taxation policies on a phased, incremental basis.  Can we take it that commitment has been shredded and will not be implemented at all?  What about the commitment to extend the levy on plastic bags to other areas such as non-reusable packaging?  Has that been shredded or does it still stand?  The Government stated that it would implement and improve, where necessary, the full range of ethics legislation.  When the Government made that commitment, did the Taoiseach have in mind the Prevention of Corruption Act 1916?  Its implementation is open to question.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">Road safety continues to be a very serious area, with 99 people killed in road traffic accidents in the first three months of the year.  The programme for Government states that the Government will introduce road safety and safe driving instruction in the secondary school curriculum.  Will renewed emphasis be placed on this and can we expect to see a serious change in that before the election given the nature of the road accidents that are taking place?</p>

            <p eId="para_186">Generally, is it not the case that, in respect of the programme for Government, in critical areas like health, social housing and education, the Government is nowhere near meeting its targets?  We were supposed to take four out of every five taxpayers from the top rate of tax.  We were supposed to supply 200,000 medical cards but the Taoiseach says the reason for the minuscule take-up of the doctor-only card is because of pay rates and the economy.  That does not accord with the incidence of low pay that all the figures show is prevalent in this economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">Social housing as a proportion of housing output and given demand was higher in the 1970s.

            <p eId="para_191">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, recently did a very detailed update on environmental issues.  Across almost 50 measures there has been substantial progress and success in a range of areas.  We will continue, as long as we are in office, to implement these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">There is a long list of actions taken to improve road safety.  On the particular matter mentioned by Deputy Sargent about looking at building road safety into the schools programme, particularly for transition year, I am not sure of the exact position but it is still being developed and examined to try to make the actual driving end of it part of the curriculum for transition year students, rather than just what happens at present where it is part of the education system with road safety lectures and films and so on.  I think there is potential to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">The point I made on medical cards and the doctor-only medical card figures was that, after three significant campaigns, if the income levels were below the ratios, people would have taken up the cards.  People who are suffering poverty or difficulties have full medical cards.  There has been a low number of doctor-only cards but this has to mean that the income levels did not fulfil the criteria, even though the figures at the time would have shown that we should have taken in an enormous amount.  Even after three campaigns that has not been the case.  Those income figures also apply to a number of other areas in social welfare.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">On social housing, it is correct to say that in the 1970s we built proportionally more social housing against the total but let us be honest, the answer to that is that people were leaving the country at a rate of knots and there was hardly any private housing.  In one year — I think it was 1983 or 1984 — out of 24,000 houses built about six were built in the public sector.  That is because we had 20% unemployment and emigration was running at 50,000 a year.  The position now is that out of 90,000 new houses, first-time buyers buy about half or 45% of those.  It is an entirely different position.  This year, between one scheme and another in affordable housing, we are proportionally benefiting a very high number of people but proportionate against 90,000.  That is only playing with figures if we are honest.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">On a general point, across the range of Government services, whether it is taxation — where we have cut the standard rate of income tax from 27% to 20% and the top rate from 48% to 42%; the entry point to the tax system is now €300; earners are exempt in huge numbers; and people on low pay are not paying any tax — or in education including the range of services and school buildings, the number of teachers, special needs teachers, home liaison teachers etc., the Government has substantially delivered on a very demanding programme.  It has been able to do that at a time when we were still able to cut the national debt, still have Government surpluses, still be able to avoid paying huge amounts of money on interest and put money away for the social welfare difficulties of the future when we will have an older community.  That has been an enormous success and is recognised as such inside and outside this country.</p>

I asked this not only on behalf of my party colleagues, but I hope I was reflecting the views of my colleagues in the Green Party and the members of the Technical Group.  There is no direct representation of the Technical Group on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  This is a significant deficiency given that, collectively, we have a greater number of Members than one of the main Opposition parties.  We have no direct voice on this commission.  Proceeding once again without debate with a motion on the statement of expenditure for the forthcoming year is deficient.

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_256">This amendment relates to the reinstatement of lands and I support it.  We had discussions with people from County Tipperary and as the Minister correctly stated, this proposal was put forward and is being administered by the local authority in the area.  That is something of which we do not see enough in respect of various forms of mining throughout the country, regardless of whether it involves direct mining, sand and gravel extraction or whatever.  It is an essential part of the reinstatement of the landscape that something such as that proposed in the amendment be incorporated in respect of all future excavations.  Where planning permission is granted by a local authority, a condition should always be included in respect of reinstatement.  For that reason, I welcome the inclusion of this provision in the Bill.  I hope it can be used as a template for other sites throughout the country, particularly those located in sensitive areas where a great deal of value can be added by way of dividend to the community and the environment through the imposition of a provision of this nature.  In areas such as those to which I refer, it is often the case that eyesores and health hazards are all that remain unless action is taken.</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_258">I warmly welcome this amendment to the Title of the Bill and the new and substantive Part 8 the Minister is introducing.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">I also welcome the fact the Ceann Comhairle has initiated a new procedure in respect of legislation to be taken in the House under which Opposition Deputies in particular will not be faced with a barrage of new amendments on Report Stage.  I am aware, as a former member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that the Ceann Comhairle has a great interest in this matter.  I welcome the fact it appears progress is being made in this regard because Opposition Members and even Government backbenchers did not have access to adequate resources to allow them, as with this legislation, to investigate the introduction of a major new part of a Bill.  That became clear during the final hour of last week's debate when a raft of extraneous issues relating to the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 and its impact on this Bill entered the debate.  The latter occurred because we did not have access to the relevant information.  I commend the Ceann Comhairle on listening to requests from Deputies, particularly on this side of the House, who were, until quite recently, poorly resourced.  They will now be in a position to do their work properly on behalf of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">On the new Part 8, it is clear the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has listened to the people of north Tipperary, particularly those who live near Silvermines and in the area surrounding Nenagh, and returned to the House with a programme for the future which, as Deputy Durkan stated, will be extremely valuable.  I commend Senator O'Meara of north Tipperary who, with other Members of this House and the Upper House, was to the forefront in trying to progress the campaign to bring about the remediation of the Silvermines land.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The most important change the Minister has introduced is the fact that when a company which obtains a licence has extracted the natural wealth from an area, we can recover State expenditure where the remediation has not been made.  When people from the Silvermines district appeared before the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and when members of that committee, including its Chairman, Deputy O'Flynn, visited the district, we were given information and witnessed for ourselves the way the company had effectively reneged on its obligations.  That was regrettable.  The Department has pursued this issue relentlessly and it is heartening to finally see this legislation undergoing its passage through the Dáil.  I commend the Minister in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I do not know whether we will have an opportunity to discuss the new Part 8 in detail because the Title is being changed to accommodate its inclusion in the Bill.  However, I welcome the methodology the Minister will be able to use to consult stakeholders in future in respect of matters of this nature.  It is a very welcome development and I commend the Civil Service and the Minister for bringing it forward.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_263">This is an interim measure and it will be repealed when the substantial minerals development Bill is enacted.  It will be important to incorporate the experience gleaned from this interim measure and other similar measures.  Deputy Broughan raised the point about the stakeholders in the community wherever a sensitive location like this exists.  That can vary from time to time and from place to place and the emphasis may be greater or lesser as the case may be.  In the last few days there has been strong opposition from the people of California to the siting of refineries offshore.  There has currently been a debate in this country on whether such a refinery should be onshore or offshore.  The experience to be gained from this is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Preliminary discussions need to encompass the full scope of likely eventualities.  It is virtually impossible to anticipate everything, but we have arrived at a junction whereby it is incumbent on everybody involved in the provision of facilities of this nature to dot the i's and cross the t's and to ensure the negotiations provided for within the law take place beforehand.  The experience gained from this interim measure should be used to good advantage in any negotiations in the future.</p>

Our committee visited Silvermines and saw the remarkably unstable and unsatisfactory leftovers from the mining operation there.  Under these amendments, does the Minister expect this or any future Government to be able to recover some of the financial costs from the companies involved in Silvermines?  What commitments or financial contributions have the companies made?  If there have not been any made to date, what guarantee do we have that the companies will pay a single euro for the rehabilitation plan that is needed?</p>

          <p eId="para_267">The Shell to Sea campaign is about creating an offshore terminal, something which has already happened off Kinsale and which would be very acceptable to the people in Rossport.  The people are prepared to talk and to do whatever has to be done to ensure their area is kept for the children in the future.  It is the same with the mines where 400 acres has been earmarked for development in the future.  The people of the area do not want to see a situation develop like that which happened in Tina Mines, where a terrible mess was left to be dealt with by the locals and their children.  That is what the Corrib gas debate is about.  This is happening under their noses for 50 permanent jobs, which is something the people cannot condone.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I thank the Deputies for their contribution and for welcoming the measure.  This has been an ongoing sore across the political divide for a number of years and it needed to be resolved.  When Deputy Michael Smith was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, there was much discussion, debate and research done on the issue.  Part of the reason for the lack of resolution of the issue was the problem of recovering costs.  There was ongoing dialogue between the Department and what is left of the company that was involved in the ownership of the mines over the years.  Attempts were made to come up with a remediation<b/>programme that would be acceptable to everybody and to which funding would be given by the company.  However, it appeared to me that if we were to depend on the company to provide a contribution, we would not get remediation that would be to the satisfaction of the local population.  For that reason I decided to bring forward this proposal to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The Government remains committed to trying to recover the costs and a legal challenge is still extant.  We served papers on this some time ago and it remains in place.  If we can recover costs we will do so, but the chances of recovery are slim.  However, we have made provision in the section to ensure that if the State spends €10.6 million, we will try to recover the costs.  We have also provided for a claim on any benefits accruing from the sale of the land.  We have done everything we can to ensure the taxpayer is protected, but in all honesty I do not expect too much of the €10.6 million to come from anyone other than the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">It is intended that this section will be repealed when the minerals development Bill is enacted.  We are finding our way on this to a certain extent.  We are using the local authority to act as agents and if that method is successful, it will become the template for any such moves in the future and we can enshrine it in legislation.  With regard to current mining operations, my constituency contains the largest lead and zinc mine in Europe and if one goes into Google earth one can see the tailing ponds before one can see the town of Navan.  I have a keen interest in ensuring these problems do not arise in future.  The Environmental Protection Agency and the Planning and Development Acts impose obligations on companies to ensure these difficulties do not arise in the future.  This does not solve the legacy problems but I would not anticipate that with regard to any current or future mines, the taxpayer will be required to meet the cost.  This is specifically a legacy issue.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_273">In page 3, line 13, after "Energy" to insert "Regulation".</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The inclusion of the word "Regulation" was discussed on Committee Stage and was referred to on Second Stage.  This is a regulatory Bill, and rightly so, although some indication has been given to the effect that it is an energy Bill, but this is not so.  As a regulatory Bill it should include in some shape or form the word "Regulation".  This is of particular importance for reference purposes.  It is important that the reference should be accessible and self-explanatory in the case when a person seeks to quote a regulatory section in respect of the energy industry.  This is a small inclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he might consider this proposal.  I am hopeful he will be in an expansive mood on this calm morning to include it for the benefits I have suggested.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_276">I have gone as far as I can and as far as is necessary with my amendment No. 47 to meet the case made by the Deputy.  The purpose of amendment No. 47 is to delete a reference to the Bill when enacted which is superfluous to the text and the purpose of subsection (c) of section 6.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">I have no difficulty with the underlying reasoning for Deputy Durkan's suggestion for the Short Title of the Bill but I do not agree with his proposal for the execution of that reasoning.  The Short Title of the Bill is simply a shorthand reference to it.  The real name or Title of the Bill is contained in the Long Title.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, change the name of the Bill to take account of the new provisions currently outside its scope.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">A clear precedent exists.  The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005 contained a number of provisions outside the scope of energy matters.  They included the use of radiological material for medical purposes and the payment of debts by Bord na Móna.  The Maritime Safety Act 2005 amends landlord and tenant legislation.  The proper place for the reference is in the Long Titles of both Acts.  My magnanimity goes so far as to accept the underlying reasons but I am dealing with it in a different way.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_279">I note the Minister's response, but I also ask him to recognise that the Opposition has been fairly magnanimous with regard to this Bill as it bears little resemblance to its original appearance at birth.  It has changed dramatically in the intervening period and the Opposition has done its best to accommodate the Minister when he found himself in a quandary.  We have accepted recommittal and allowed the redrafting of the entire Bill.  I urge the insertion of the word "Regulation" as this word is an integral part of the Bill's purpose and this should be clearly stated in the Title of the Bill.  It would be more descriptive of the Bill's purpose and would be the natural reference point for all those involved in the provision of energy facilities, whether that be gas, electricity or ordinary heating of public buildings or dwelling houses, as another amendment will propose.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The Bill regulates the area of efficiency and that is to be welcomed, but those regulations lay down certain criteria and guidelines which need to be followed to achieve particular standards.  I suggest the Bill could be titled a miscellaneous standards or provisions Bill or the word "Regulation" could be inserted.  This would introduce the need for the commission and the Minister, in conjunction with the commission, to be in full control of the regulatory system.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">I acknowledge the co-operation in many different guises which I have received from the Opposition.  I am not trying to be awkward in not accepting the amendment.  The Deputy will know from reading the amendments that the Government has accepted the principle of a number of changes that were suggested on Committee Stage because they were good suggestions.  For instance, we are increasing the minimum number of days for consultation on draft policy directives and tying the text of those provisions more closely to the Green Paper, as requested by Deputies opposite.  We are providing a legislative underpinning for the involvement of the joint committee in the consideration of all draft policy directives.  We have taken on board a number of suggestions made on Committee Stage.  It is regrettable I cannot accept this amendment but I take the Deputy's point on the number of regulatory aspects.  However, every Bill that is passed is regulatory; the House legislates for something so it is therefore regulatory.  I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment because we have gone as far as we can on this proposal.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_416">"(2) <i>Sections 4, 6, 8, 11</i> to <i>14</i> and <i>18</i> of this Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may by order or orders appoint either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so appointed for different purposes or provisions.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">This is a minor technical amendment.  It specifies which provisions of the Bill are not to be brought into effect on its enactment but which are to be brought into effect by means of a ministerial order instead.  In effect, this is a reversal of the provisions of the current text of section 1, which highlights those sections brought into effect on enactment.  Therefore, we are just switching it around because we think it is easier.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Several of the new amendments to the Bill will need to be brought into effect immediately on its enactment.  For example, the amendment allows for such matters as the power of Bord Gáis Éireann to create capital stock, increasing the borrowing limits of Bord na Móna and the rehabilitation of mine sites, to come in automatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Following consideration of the issues raised by Members on Committee Stage and because there is no administrative barrier to prevent it, it has also been decided to bring certain provisions — for example, those governing emergency measures and policy directions to the CER — into effect immediately on enactment.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The use of the ministerial order should, where possible, be restricted to those provisions which are dependent on preparatory work for their successful implementation and which are therefore unsuitable for bringing into effect on enactment of the Bill — for example, the regulation of electrical contractors and gas installers.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">By specifying which provisions require such an order, rather than those that do not, it serves as a useful checklist for those responsible for drafting such orders.  We believe this will make the procedure much clearer.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_200">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_422">The universally suitable and acceptable answer is yes and no.  The Minister is right in saying that there are some situations where the gradual introduction of particular sections of an Act may be desirable.  In that case, the provisions of the Act are merely being introduced as required or on request.  While that may be fine in some cases, Members of the House will recall that some sections of certain legislative measures were not activated or put into operation for one reason or another.  I am not certain therefore that the Minister's idea is a good one.  I would be willing to overlook the deviation if, for example, it were to be introduced subject to Oireachtas approval.  Amendment No. 7 meets that requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The term "subject to Oireachtas approval" would mean that on or in the course of introducing various sections, there would be a requirement for such matters to be referred to the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate.  We tried to introduce such a provision during the debates on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  It has also been a feature of discussions on a similar Bill.  Members of the Oireachtas currently find it difficult to raise questions that are in order concerning certain subjects, including a sensitive subject of this nature.  It would be highly beneficial to the operation of the Oireachtas and the monitoring of legislation if the term "subject to Oireachtas approval" was included.  The Minister may find himself on the Opposition benches and on the receiving end of these matters in a short while — not that I wish him any harm or the Government any slippage in the opinion polls but they say one man's meat is another's poison.  It may be beneficial from the point of view of the Government not to include this provision or to introduce the sections on a piecemeal basis but the Government amendment is imprecise and would be significantly improved if my amendment was accepted.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_424">I do not wish to delay the discussion because a number of important amendments have yet to be moved but the public generally takes the view that a Bill passes into law once it has been signed by the President.  Recently, for example, I was asked whether the fireworks provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 had entered into force.  There are often misconceptions among the public about when legislation is brought into force.  We all remember the classic case of the Children Act 1997, key aspects of which have not yet been implemented one decade later.  In this regard, Deputy Kenny asked a question this morning about the treatment of young offenders.  Tranches of the Children Act are not in effect because the Government will not spend the necessary money.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The public is very interested in some of the ideas presented by this Bill and expect them to be implemented.  The Minister claims that his amendment will provide for clarity because, in the past, Bills could take years to enact.  Sections 2, 5 and 16 to 18, inclusive, are already excluded.  Now, amendment No. 6 proposes that sections 4, 6, 8, 11 to 14, inclusive, and 18 will come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may set.  Clearly, certain elements of the Bill, such as the sections pertaining to gas and electricity safety, the interconnector and combined heat and power, are being included but debate on this could continue for a long time, so the sense of urgency we were trying to foster regarding, for example, the interconnector or microgeneration, might not be reflected in the Bill.  The Minister may be able to bring into force immediate provisions to direct CER or act in an emergency but that remains uncertain.  After going through the trouble of getting this Bill right, its sections should enter into force as soon after enactment as possible so that we can move on with the energy agenda.  However, the Minister is confusing the matter with this amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_426">I oppose the proposed amendment, although I understand the intention behind it, on a basic point of principle.  With regard to section 16, which concerns capitalisation of Bord Gáis in order to allow an ESOT to purchase a stake in the company, I have yet to hear an argument from the Minister setting out the reasons the State should allocate funding.  We asked on Committee Stage to know the union's case for the capitalisation of the company and allocation of a significant shareholding, as well as the particular reasons for the Minister's change of mind.  If I recall the Minister's comments, we are looking at up to €25,000 for every individual shareholder, based on the estimated final capitalisation of the company.  The Minister said he would share with Opposition Deputies the case made by the union regarding any benefits or new productivity arrangements which would justify such a deal.  Given the history of ESOTS and the effect they are having on State companies following the success — from a union perspective — of Eircom, I would have preferred to retain the practice whereby decisions are made according to ministerial regulations.  I do not believe in enacting Bills which allow for such decisions to be made upon enactment; how can I make a decision when I have not been presented with an argument from the Minister on the benefits or changes in working practice that persuaded him to change his mind?  In the absence of the reasoning for the decision, I would prefer section 16 to be issued by the Minister if he believes it a good idea.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_427">I also oppose this amendment because the people I represent do not trust this Minister, who, with his predecessors, has been responsible for everything that happened to the Corrib gas field, despite never visiting the area.  When will he meet the people involved?  A TG4 survey revealed that 61% of respondents were in favour of Shell to Sea, 66% supported the stance of the Rossport five, while a survey conducted by the <i>Mayo Advertiser</i> indicated that 40% of people could not care less, only 15% were in favour of Shell’s actions and the remainder wanted Shell to go to sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">In light of the Minister's responsibilities, when will he respond to the request made by Independent Deputies for a period of calm and the suspension of work at the Bellanaboy terminal in order that negotiations could be held?  The Government will have to involve itself in this because, while the people of the area are all interested in negotiating, the Advantica report did not take account of the location of the pipeline and that remains the issue.  The Minister has not responded to the statement issued by Deputy Joe Higgins of the Socialist Party, Deputy Healy and myself.  Deputy Sargent, who visited the area yesterday, made a call for greater transparency from Shell and urged the Minister to respond.  The Fianna Fáil candidate in the area, Councillor Frank Chambers, has joined the chorus of those seeking discussions on an alternative location.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Two engineers, Brian Coyle and Leo Corcoran, a former Bord Gáis employee, have asked the Minister to commission a report by Advantica on the optimum location for the gas terminal, which they believe to be central to the dispute over the onshore pipeline. Given that they are the Minister's people and that he has responsibility for the matter, when will he meet his people?  While there is collective Government responsibility for this matter, if I were the Minister I would find it hard to admit I never stood down there and never met those people.  The Minister has cast aspersions on those people.  They are fine decent honourable people who have been heavily put upon.  They are very disturbed and upset over what has happened to their area.  They have legitimate fears that have never been addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The location of the pipeline to the refinery is the problem, as has always been the case.  The Minister continues to insist on Shell proceeding to lay this pipeline, which does not have permission and could have serious problems regarding cold venting of gas which have been admitted.  Serious questions remain to be answered.  Why does the Minister continue to ignore the people?  Why will he not visit them?  Everyone who has done so has received a warm welcome and a cup of tea, and has heard what this is all about.  I do not know how the Minister can stand over all that is happening when he refuses to visit those people.  When will he visit?</p>
          <p eId="para_431">When will the Minister address the initiative seeking an alternative location for the terminal suggested by the Independent Deputies, Deputy Sargent, the leader of the Green Party, the Fianna Fáil councillor, Frank Chambers, and, I believe, Ian McAndrew from Fine Gael?  When will the Minister address the report by the engineers, Leo Corcoran and Brian Coyle, which called for a study by Advantica Consultants, who did not investigate the location of the refinery?  When will the Minister commission them to report on alternative locations?</p>

          <p eId="para_446">The Deputy continually talks and tells everybody else that they should listen.  A small number of Independent Deputies made a request last Monday week.  As the Deputy is well aware, I said last week that when the mediation process was established, both sides were asked to enter unconditional talks, with no conditions attached by either side.  Both sides indicated they were interested in doing so and the people representing Shell to Sea refused to sit down face-to-face with Shell to have those talks.  That is a fact, which can easily be verified.  As I know the Deputy does not want to mislead the House, he should not talk to me in this House about not being willing to talk to anybody.  Unless someone is saying what Shell to Sea wants him or her to say in this House, its representatives do not want to listen.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The local people the Deputy represents had genuine concerns and everything that could possibly be done to allay those concerns was done.  I listened to them through third parties, through their spokespersons and through their public representatives, and I responded positively.  Some of them have not moved an inch.  Some of them have and are certainly less concerned following the report of Advantica Consultants, mediation, consultation and everything else.  I will not try to satisfy Shell to Sea supporters, who represent a loose conglomeration of political activists from Sinn Féin, anarchists affiliated to various environmental groups etc.  While they are entitled to their view, my concern has always been for the local people who had genuine fears and concerns.  I have tried to address those concerns.  While some people are not satisfied, I can do nothing further in that regard.  I am sorry that some people do not seem to be able to get that message.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The amendment we are discussing is fairly minor and technical, and is designed to clarify.  Any Bill brought before the House sets out various principles and objectives.  In some cases they cannot be done immediately on enactment of the Bill.  One good example relates to the provisions dealing with the installers, safety etc.  Discussions are ongoing to make this as effective as possible and to try to prevent it from becoming too bureaucratic.  By the time the Bill has passed through the Seanad, those talks may have been completed and we might be able to commence the section fairly quickly or it might take somewhat longer.  However, in such cases where we are trying to tease out some of the details, it makes sense to have a commencement date.  That is all that is proposed in this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">I take the point made by the Deputies on the danger of going down a particular route and having commencement dates for individual sections.  It is always a danger that matters will drag on.  The alternative is to shelve the Bill until all the details are worked out and then come back to try to get the Bill passed through the House, which does not make much sense either.  I assure Deputies, who have put considerable work into the Bill, as have my officials and I, that it is intended to have all the provisions brought into effect as quickly as is possible and feasible.  There is no desire to delay any of them.  Some of them are extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Deputy Durkan has been very consistent in his proposals in trying to ensure we have Oireachtas scrutiny of Bills.  All of the orders will be required to be laid before the Oireachtas as a matter of course.  Some of them need to be affirmed and some of them will be implemented if not opposed.  It allows for scrutiny of the detail.  While the Deputy has an interest in all sections, I know he has a particular interest in the section relating to installers and the safety aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">I will take another provision that was mentioned, that of combined heat and power.</p>

          <p eId="para_454">On section 6, which concerns combined heat and power, there is ongoing work at EU level, which work will affect the section.  We do not want to commence the section until the work is finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I will forward whatever details I can obtain on Bord Gáis Éireann before the end of the week.  The principle involved was that if the workers were to get an ESOP, its value would have to be reflected in savings to the company over a particular period and the State would also have to receive some dividend.  Some of the details involved are commercially sensitive but we will provide as much detail as we possibly can.</p>

          <p eId="para_458">It has been necessary for me to try to incorporate the theme which the Minister says I have been pursuing all the time, particularly from the point of view of the Opposition.  We find our interaction with the Government in the House is being narrowed time and again.  Eventually Parliament will become superfluous to the legislative process and this should not be the case.  There should be total transparency and accountability at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">It is proposed to defer the commencement date of six sections of the Bill.  This is a fairly fundamental move.  Notwithstanding what the Minister said about the ongoing talks, I do not believe one can produce legislation on that basis.  One must determine what one believes to be legislatively correct.  Over the summer we had to exchange views with the various interested groups that made representations to us.  This process is particularly difficult for the Opposition — it is almost impossible.  The Minister will ultimately introduce particularly sensitive and important legislation on a staggered basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Deputy Broughan referred to other legislation where the staggered approach caused a problem.  It would be very helpful if, in view of the proposed deletion, my amendment were accepted.  I know the Minister said measures will be laid before the House but this is certainly not the same as having accountability in the House.  We need to recognise that the most effective course of action is to include matters on the Order Paper so that they can be raised in the House and the Minister can be questioned.</p>

          <p eId="para_463">I have a right to defend myself in the House when accusations are made against me.  The opposition in Mayo is not confined to a couple of radicals.  It includes the local population, whether the Minister likes it or not.  If he cares to read any of the surveys other than the one conducted by Shell, including those by TG4 and the <i>Mayo Advertiser</i>, he will note that the vast majority of the population is in favour of what the protesters are trying to do.  They are just trying to be safe in their own area.  Every party is entitled to support the campaign and no democratic party should be overruled.  To say otherwise is wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_466">There is great willingness to talk and a very genuine proposal that should be considered.  One should remember the location of the refinery was never the subject of the study and this is the outstanding problem.  Even an inspector from An Bord Pleanála said it was in the wrong location.  There is a great need for the Minister to intervene.  He could talk to Shell to Sea, which represents the majority of people in the area, and to Shell.  This is the way forward and the Minister has responsibility in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">We hope the Minister will visit the site in Mayo.  He has been so involved in the process but has never visited.  If he visited the headquarters of Shell to Sea, he would see it is a trailer, in which he would receive a hot cup of tea and a welcome.  He would hear for the first time what this matter is all about and meet the real people involved, that is, the ordinary, honourable, decent people I represent.</p>

          <p eId="para_468">The House understands that very detailed and intense preparatory work is involved in producing the legislation, including in respect of the all-island energy market.  When we first discussed the Bill, we were trying to address all the safety issues.  The Minister is, at long last, establishing a very fundamental safety regime for electricity and gas.  The public would like to know that it will be in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">When the interested parties met the Opposition representatives before the consideration of the Bill, they highlighted what they believed were deficiencies in the way the Minister was to regulate existing organisations and in the way safety measures were approved.  One can say for definite that the gas and electricity safety measures are paramount and should be enforced as soon as possible.  Regulations are made available to the Oireachtas Library but this is not the same as discussing them in the House, as Deputy Durkan indicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Let us consider Deputy Cowley's comments.  To allow us concentrate on the Bill, which is not primarily about exploration, is there any way in which the Minister could facilitate face to face talks between Shell and the key people from Mayo?  I note the points he has made in this regard.  The whole country has been interested in this subject.  There has been much comment on the matter in the media today and different parties, including representatives from my party, have a particular interest in it.  Does the Minister foresee a fundamental role for Bord Gáis Éireann in resolving the dispute and getting the gas ashore safely in an agreed fashion so that we would have the interim fuel supply the country desperately needs?</p>

        <b>Mr. Allen</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
          if he has discussed the upcoming accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union with his European counterpart Ministers, with particular regard to the question of opening access to labour markets for the citizens of these States; if consultations between his Department and other Departments have taken place with regard to this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [34714/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_244">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_488">The preparedness of Bulgaria and Romania for membership of the European Union has been a major issue on the EU agenda since they signed their treaty of accession in April 2005.  Considerable attention has been given to the Commission's efforts in monitoring the two countries' preparations for accession.  The matter has been discussed by EU Foreign Ministers on a number of occasions.  The most recent discussion took place at this month's meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, when both countries were commended on the reforms they have undertaken.  The Council looks forward to welcoming Bulgaria and Romania into the EU in January 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_489">There has been a particular focus on labour market access in recent months.  As Deputies are aware, the Government decided yesterday that Ireland will avail of the transitional labour market access arrangements which are provided for in the EU's accession treaty with Bulgaria and Romania.  Therefore, citizens of Bulgaria and Romania will continue to require work permits if they are to take up employment here after the two countries accede to the EU in January of next year.  The Government's decision was taken on the basis of careful consideration of the issues involved and following consultations with the social partners.  Consultations on this issue have also taken place between the various Departments.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has responsibility for labour market and work permit issues, has been particularly involved.  The Government had extensive contact with other member states to determine their intentions.</p>
            <p eId="para_490">Finland, which currently holds the EU Presidency, is the only pre-2004 EU member state to have announced that it will allow unrestricted labour market access for citizens of Bulgaria and Romania from next January.  Other member states have indicated they will impose restrictions.  A number of key countries have not yet opened their labour markets to the member states which joined the EU in 2004.  The British Government, which did not impose any restrictions in 2004, has decided to apply a work permit requirement on this occasion.  The British decision was an important consideration in the Government's analysis of the options available to Ireland.  When the last EU enlargement took place in 2004, Ireland was one of just three member states not to restrict labour market access for citizens of the acceding states from central and eastern Europe.  As a result, many people from those countries have come to work in Ireland over the past two years.  Ireland has taken in almost half as many workers from the new member states as the UK, which has a population 15 times greater than the population of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_491">The ESRI has pointed out that many people have moved to Ireland at a time of rapid economic growth.  The broadly positive impact of that migration to date may not be evident in a more difficult economic climate.  We need to continue to monitor the effects of migration on society, for example on our education, health and social security systems.  In that context, and in the light of the intentions of its EU partners, the Government's decision to continue to require Bulgarians and Romanians to seek work permits was the prudent and proper course of action to take.  It means workers from Bulgaria and Romania will be able to come here when they can fill a genuine labour market need.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_245">
            <from>Mr. Allen</from>
            <p eId="para_492">Why was the House treated with such disrespect when this important decision was being taken?  The Minister said the social partners were consulted.  The Joint Committee on European Affairs wanted to discuss this matter with the Department of the Taoiseach, but no such session took place.  The importance of that committee was ignored.  A decision was made without any consultation with the other political parties.  Does the Minister agree the manner in which the announcement was made was a further example of the downgrading of this House?  The announcement was made on the coat-tails of the UK announcement, which was made yesterday morning.  When the UK authorities jumped, we jumped after them in the absence of any consultation with the other political parties.  The Minister mentioned that an impact study has been conducted on our social services.  To what extent has a study taken place of the impact on our hospital and educational services of the influx of workers from the accession states that followed the last round of EU enlargement?</p>
            <p eId="para_493">I congratulate Bulgaria and Romania on their forthcoming membership of the EU.  Their Governments now have the hard job of explaining to the populations of those countries the reasons they are being excluded in this way.  I support the Government's decision, in principle.  There should have been some consultation, at least, with the partners which matter most in this country's political structures, including this House.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_246" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_494">I do not accept that the other political parties were not involved in this process.  I participated in a number of discussions at Oireachtas committees about the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union.  The question of whether free access would be given to workers from those countries was discussed at those meetings.  I made the point on many occasions, as I did in my earlier reply, that Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom were the only three of the 15 pre-2004 member states to give free access to workers from the ten new countries which joined the EU in May 2004.  It is estimated that approximately 275,000 people from those accession countries have been given personal public service numbers in this State, which has a population of 4.2 million, over a relatively short space of time.  Approximately 500,000 such people went to the UK, which has a population of 56 million, over the same period.  Just 10,000 people from the accession states went to Sweden, which was the only other country to allow free labour market access, in the same timeframe.  That is an indication that Ireland has done its bit to provide for free access, by and large.</p>
            <p eId="para_495">The Government examined the situation carefully before it made this decision.  It considered the recommendations of the social partners and the views which were expressed in this House.  I cannot comment on the request that was made to the Department of the Taoiseach, which was highlighted by Deputy Allen just now.  Like the Minister who has direct responsibility for work permits, Deputy Martin, I was willing to come to the House or a committee meeting to discuss this issue at any time.  I welcome the fact Fine Gael supports the Government's view, which concurs exactly with the statements made by the Economic and Social Research Institute and the social partners, on the current situation.  It should be emphasised that under the system in place at EU level, countries like Ireland which continue to keep restrictions in place will ultimately have to provide for free access after a relatively short time — a seven-year period at the very most.  After separate periods of two years, two years and three years have passed, countries which have put restrictions in place will have to open their labour markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">A number of countries, including some major countries in the EU which did not allow free access in 2004, have yet to open their borders to the member states which acceded to the Union in that year.  Ireland has done more than its fair share by allowing free access to its labour market.  While we acknowledge the principle of free access, we ultimately have to bear in mind all the various considerations, which we have done in a reasoned way.  We were in fairly constant contact with our colleagues in Britain about what they were doing in this regard.  It does not relate to the issue of the common travel area between Ireland and Britain.  It relates more to the fact that if the British authorities introduced restrictions but we did not, Ireland would be the only English-speaking country in the EU without any restrictions.  In our view, that might have led to larger numbers than normal coming to our shores.</p>

            <from>Mr. Allen</from>
            <p eId="para_497">What discussions took place with our other EU partners about the opening of their borders?  The decisions which have been made — I accept the Government's decision may have been forced on it — are contrary to the EU principle of mobility of labour.  Can the Minister give the House details of the pressures which are being placed on other Governments to open their labour markets, so the impact on Ireland, the UK and Sweden will not be as great in the future as it has been in recent years?  Surely the issue of the common travel area was central to the Government's decision.  Why did the Government show such indecent haste in jumping to a decision within two hours of yesterday's announcement of the UK decision?</p>

We had been in constant contact.  It had nothing to do with following the British slavishly, off the top of our heads.  This was a result of constant negotiations with the respective Departments and the respective Prime Ministers.  The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair discussed this issue recently at St. Andrew's in Scotland.</p>

            <p eId="para_501">There is pressure on other countries but they must make their own decisions and cannot slavishly follow others.  Similarly, we must make decisions based on the circumstances that pertain at a particular time.  A number of countries, including France, Germany and Belgium, have indicated they will probably impose restrictions.  Time is running out for those countries regarding the previous enlargement and between 2009 and 2011 they will be compelled to allow full access.</p>

          his views on whether genocide has taken, and is taking place in Darfur; and the most recent and explicit proposals that have been made by the European Union in terms of an adequately resourced and expanded United Nations force being given a mandate either in support of or within the forces of the African Union already in place.  
        [34712/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_252" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_504">Bringing to justice those responsible for serious human rights violations is an essential element in restoring peace to Darfur.  In October 2004, an international commission of inquiry was established by the UN Secretary General.  Part of its mandate was to determine whether acts of genocide had occurred there.  The commission's report was published on 25 January 2005.  While stopping short of a finding of genocide against the Sudanese Government, the commission established that the government and the Janjaweed were responsible for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law amounting to crimes under international law, which might amount to crimes against humanity.  The commission also found credible evidence that rebel forces were responsible for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law that might amount to war crimes.</p>
            <p eId="para_505">The commission pointed out that its conclusion that no genocidal policy had been pursued and implemented in Darfur by the Sudanese Government should not be taken in any way as detracting from the gravity of the crimes perpetrated in that region.  The commission also recognised that in some instances individuals, including government officials, may commit acts with genocidal intent.  Whether this was the case in Darfur could only be determined by a competent court on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_506">The Security Council decided to refer the situation in Darfur since 1 July 2002 to the prosecutor of the International Court of Justice.  The prosecutor decided to open an investigation into the situation in Darfur, which is still underway.  In his June 2006 report to the Security Council, the prosecutor referred to allegations that some of the groups involved in the commission of crimes in Darfur did so with specific genocidal intent.  He indicated that this issue remains the subject of investigation and that he would not draw any conclusions as to the character of the crimes pending the completion of a full and impartial investigation.  The International Criminal Court is the most appropriate body to investigate and try those accused of the dreadful crimes which have occurred in Darfur.  Until the prosecutor's investigation has been completed and his conclusions made known, I would not wish to express a view on whether genocide has taken place, or is still occurring, in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_507">The Government remains deeply concerned by the grave political and humanitarian crisis taking place in Darfur.  We are using all avenues to work for a resolution of the major challenges that exist there.  Both bilaterally and as part of the European Union, we have played an active role in the concerted international campaign to persuade the Sudanese Government to accept a UN force in Darfur.  This force was mandated by the UN Security Council.  In October, the General Affairs and External Relations Council reconfirmed its full support for the Security Council's decision and urged the Government of Sudan to give unambiguous consent to its implementation.  It was emphasised that a UN operation is the only realistic option for a sustainable, long-term peacekeeping operation in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_508">In advance of the transition to a UN force, Ireland and the EU will continue to be involved in supporting the African Union's ceasefire monitoring force in Darfur, AMIS, so that its effectiveness can be maximized to the greatest extent possible.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_253">
            <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_509">I am grateful to the Minister for his reply and do not intend to pursue the issue of whether the term genocide should be used.</p>
            <p eId="para_510">The figures on those who have died suggest a concentrated attack on a particular people.  Some 200,000 black, African Muslims have been killed in two years, approximately 1.45 million people have been displaced, with 500,000 in need of urgent assistance, and deaths from disease and malnutrition, secondary causes, have been estimated at 180,000 in 2005 with another 80,000 since added.</p>
            <p eId="para_511">I am not interested in the argument of whether this is a conflict between settled and nomadic people.  Those with the power to bomb villages have done so in a concentrated way.  On the other hand, factions have emerged representing signatories and non-signatories of the peace agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_512">The current UK proposal for an international conference of Heads of State has not been accepted by the President of Sudan.  However, there is a suggestion that a meeting at the level of Ministers of Foreign Affairs might be acceptable.  Would the Government consider facilitating such a meeting as a preparatory phase for the meeting proposed by the UK?</p>
            <p eId="para_513">Most recently, the Sudanese President seems to have accepted the strengthening and increase in the African Union presence.  It will act for the United Nations with logistics provided by non-Africans.</p>
            <p eId="para_514">The Darfur Consortium represents 40 African non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and it is concerned at the arrest in Saudi Arabia of Abulgasem Ahmed Abulgasem at a conference on Sudan.  He is from Darfur and has been subjected to an extraordinary rendition to Sudan where he is now held without access and proper procedures relating to vindication.</p>

            <p eId="para_515">I welcome the Deputy's approach to this matter because the question of whether it is genocide is academic.  It is an appalling crime.  I was there in July and was the first Minister from any country to visit Darfur since the peace agreement the previous May.  What I saw in the Abu Shok displacement camp in Al-Fashir, Darfur, was hell on earth.  Some 50,000 people there were living entirely on aid from NGOs and I saw in stark terms the difficulties facing people in the circumstances.  They came from very fertile land but were driven away by the conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_516">I compliment the British Government and Prime Minister Blair on the move to propose an international conference.  On the one hand it would put pressure on the Sudanese Government, while, on the other, it would indicate to the Sudanese that there are incentives to be had.  The Deputy will acknowledge that this is not simply an issue of throwing in UN mandated forces from western powers, effectively adding white soldiers to the maelstrom.  Some suggest that this would make Iraq look like a picnic.  This issue must be handled in a sensitive way and Prime Minister Blair's proposal is welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">In principle, the Government has no problem being involved in or hosting such a conference.  However, I have been to Sudan and met the Foreign Minister in recent weeks who is of a different party to the president.  Sudanese Government decisions are made by the president.  If a conference were to be held, it would have to be at heads of state level.  At EU level we have supported the call by the British Government for a heads of state conference.</p>

            <p eId="para_521">Having visited Darfur just a few months ago, it is clear that circumstances have worsened and quite a number of people have been killed or displaced since then.  The position is going from bad to worse and the international community must adopt a strong stance.  However, it is not a simple issue of throwing in a UN-mandated force.  I saw for myself when I visited Al Fashir, the headquarters of the AMIS in Darfur, that they were doing a difficult job with relatively small numbers.  While I am happy that a decision has been taken to beef up the AMIS, it needs logistical support from major forces.  When I was there the force had 7,000 troops in an area one and a half times the size of France.  One can see the difficulties that such a force would have.</p>
            <p eId="para_522">This is a key issue and must be handled sensitively at international level.  I met the head of the African Union in Addis Ababa on the same trip.  He had just returned from a meeting of the African Union where many of his colleagues had put pressure on the Sudanese president to accept UN involvement in Darfur.</p>

            <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_523">My proposal for an Irish preparatory conference might be constructed on the basis of addressing regional issues.  This affects not only Sudan, but also Chad, the Central African Republic and Uganda.  The preparatory conference could focus on the regional issues and provide an opening for the heads of state meeting that is at the heart of the British proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_524">Mr. Abulgasem Ahmed Abulgasem has been arrested and moved to Sudan.  He was a participant in the Abuja talks where he represented the Sudan Liberation Movement, hence the sensitivity of his position.</p>
            <p eId="para_525">Those of us interested in such issues are tested by something which is not being driven forward at UN level, namely, the difference between humanitarian intervention and humanitarian protection.  Does the Minister agree that using sovereignty as a shield while massive loss of life and dislocation is taking place is an abuse of the concept of sovereignty?  It is irrelevant at this stage whether we describe this as genocide.  The international community must have the right to intervene where a state is not protecting a significant part of its population.  We must all come to terms with this.</p>

            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_526">I agree entirely with what the Deputy has said.  My EU colleagues and I discussed protecting the principle enshrined within the UN reform package.  This is the first instance where the international community has a responsibility to protect vulnerable people.  We are not at this stage yet.</p>
            <p eId="para_527">We must be careful in how we deal with this.  The greatest focus must be on the president, who hopes to become the head of the African Union in January 2007.  I have told our EU colleagues that I believe we should use our influence, particularly in Africa, to let the Sudanese president know that if he wishes to accede to the chair of the African Union, he must do so in such a way that concurs with the views of most member nations that a joint African Union-United Nations mandated force should be allowed into Sudan.</p>
            <p eId="para_528">As regards the conference, I am not saying that Ireland would not be involved in such a conference.  However, I would question whether it would produce any result.  Having visited Darfur and spent quite a lot of time with Sudanese Ministers, I believe the power rests with the president.  The focus should be put on the president and not taken from him.  That is why I welcome the British initiative.  I will instruct my officials and, at the next meeting, I will personally raise the issue of the proposed conference, preferably at heads of state level.</p>

          if his attention has been drawn to the fact that at least 11,000 child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are either still with armed groups or unaccounted for more than two years after the country began demobilising its boy and girl fighters; and if he will raise this issue at the United Nations.

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_261">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_530">The recent Amnesty International report on child soldiers has highlighted one of the most disturbing elements of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC.  As the report recommends, the new government which will shortly take office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo must prioritise the treatment of children who have been involved in the long-term conflict there.</p>
            <p eId="para_531">Under international law, the recruitment and use of children under 15 in a conflict is considered a war crime.  The International Criminal Court, which is carrying out an investigation at the request of the DRC Government, should fully investigate any reports of children being recruited and used in conflict.  Ireland and its EU partners will also continue to highlight the issue of child soldiers in the DRC in relevant UN fora, including the ongoing General Assembly session.</p>
            <p eId="para_532">It is important not to underestimate the scale of the overall challenge which confronts the DRC and its people, now that it is on the verge of securing its first democratically elected government in more than 40 years.  Some 3 million people are still displaced in the DRC, while an estimated 1,200 people die daily from preventable conflict-related causes.  Basic services are either severely degraded or non-existent — there is only 500 km of paved road in a country the size of western Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_533">If there is to be any chance of confronting the many challenges the country faces, the international community will have to stay actively engaged in the DRC.  Ireland and its EU partners are taking the lead in this regard.  The EU and its member states have provided the bulk of the financing for the current electoral process which is due to conclude on 29 October.  The EU is also actively engaged in supporting vital security sector reform in the DRC and has deployed the EUFOR mission to support the UN peacekeeping mission during the current electoral period.</p>
            <p eId="para_534">The international community is also providing substantial support to assist with the demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants in the DRC.  This forms part of a wider regional programme, the multi-country demobilisation and reintegration programme, which is led by the World Bank.  In response to a request from the World Bank, the Government and Irish Aid has decided that Ireland should provide financial support for this programme, the largest of its kind in the world, which aims at demobilising 350,000 former combatants in seven countries of the Great Lakes region.  By providing support for this programme, amounting to €500,000 in 2006, Ireland will be in a better position to join the other donors in urging the new DRC Government to ensure it gives greater priority to the needs of former child soldiers.</p>

          <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_262">
            <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_535">Does the Minister agree that this type of exploitation of children is unacceptable and what will he do about it at United Nations level?  Does the Minister accept that these young boys and girls should be in school receiving education, playing games and living a normal childhood rather than finding themselves conscripted as child soldiers?  What specific targets should the UN have?  Can 50% of these 11,000 children be placed in education and proper care by 2007?  What investment is being spent on these children by the EU, the UN and others?  What role do drugs play?  Many of these children are souped up on drugs which causes a level of violence rarely seen anywhere in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_536">I welcome the Minister pointing out that anyone who involves children under 15 years of age in such activities is committing a war crime.  It is unacceptable that in 2006, 11,000 children are being exploited in such a manner.  I welcome the €500,000 donation from Ireland to combat this problem, but to help these children who are seriously at risk, the EU and United Nations must put proper investment in place.</p>

            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_537">The international fund I referred to has a target of €300 million to assist with the demobilisation and reintegration process.  Ireland is playing its part — since 2003 we have contributed €12 million to the conflict areas in emergency and recovery funding.  We provided €6 million this year and, on top of that, we are providing €1.3 million for the electoral process.  The hope is that by the second round of elections due at the end of this month, the situation will have stabilised.  A total of 19,000 have already been demobilised under this and other programmes run by the Congolese Government.  It is a scandal that 11,000 children are still in this position but we will work on that and Ireland is in a position to hold the Congolese Government to account over these children who have not been reintegrated into the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_538">Ireland does not shy away from this.  We think it is a scandal that children are used as soldiers.  It is a terrible problem across Africa.  We saw similar situations in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Darfur, where young people are running around with Kalashnikov rifles having been enticed by money, drugs and, in the poor settings of these countries, the desire to escape their existing misery by participating in these armies.  It is a complicated issue to address because people are recruited as children for the money and the good life offered by an escape from the extreme poverty of their homes in countries experiencing conflict.  Often it is more enjoyable for youngsters to take off with these warlords than to stay at home.  We are focused on the issue.</p>

        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
          the steps being taken by his Department to convey Ireland’s condemnation of recent nuclear testing to the North Korean regime; the further steps being taken to press for reform of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [34715/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_264" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_540">Following a statement of intent issued on 3 October, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced that it had carried out an underground nuclear test on 9 October.  I immediately strongly condemned this provocative action by the DPRK.  It is a serious threat to the security and stability of the region, as well as a direct contravention of the international objectives of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  It ignored the will of the international community and ran counter to the patient efforts of the DPRK's neighbours to work constructively to find a diplomatic solution through the six party talks process.</p>
            <p eId="para_541">My statement of condemnation was communicated to the DPRK authorities through its embassy in London.  Finland, acting as Presidency, also issued a statement on behalf of the EU.  At the current session of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly, Ireland, together with our partners in the New Agenda Coalition, tabled a resolution condemning the DRPK's test of a nuclear device and emphasising the central role of the NPT in achieving nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">However, it is clear in the case of DPRK that words of condemnation must also be backed by concrete action.  On 14 October, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1718 empowering the international community to enforce specific sanctions, including an arms embargo, as well as a ban on any items which could contribute to the DPRK's nuclear, ballistic missile or WMD programmes.  At the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council last week, the EU committed itself to the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1718, as well as Resolution 1695, adopted in July in response to the DPRK's earlier controversial ballistic missile tests.  We are currently taking the necessary steps to ensure Ireland's full compliance with these two resolutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_543">As regards the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the testing of a nuclear explosive device by DPRK is a matter of grave concern.  Since the DPRK's announced withdrawal from the NPT in 2003 and subsequent declaration that it possesses nuclear weapons, the international community has consistently urged the DPRK to abandon its policy, completely dismantle its nuclear weapons programme and comply fully with its obligations under the NPT.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">Review conferences of the NPT take place every five years and afford an opportunity to review the implementation of the treaty and all its provisions.  The next scheduled NPT review conference will take place in 2010 and will be preceded by a series of preparatory meetings beginning in 2007.  Regrettably, the last review conference, in May 2005, ended without agreement on substantive conclusions and recommendations on how to strengthen the non-proliferation regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_545">I have constantly made clear that the effective implementation of all aspects of the NPT, including the nuclear weapons states' commitment to disarmament, would serve to strengthen the global non-proliferation context.  The entry into force of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty would also be a positive step.  This is in no way to suggest that the course adopted by the DPRK's dangerous and totalitarian regime has any shred of justification.</p>

            <from>Mr. Allen</from>
            <p eId="para_546">Almost 60 countries now have nuclear reactors for research or power generation and 40 have the industrial and scientific infrastructure to build a nuclear weapon at short notice.  The US has entered an agreement to pass on nuclear technology to India, which is not a signatory to the NPT, and Iran, Israel and Pakistan have nuclear weapons.  Does the Minister agree that we are reaching a point of no return where the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons treaty is becoming defunct?</p>
            <p eId="para_547">In view of the Minister's admission that the talks about a review of the treaty ended in failure at the United Nations in 2006, there is now urgent need to reconvene the talks on the treaty, not to wait until 2010, which may be too late.  As a country that was an architect of the treaty, we should act as a global leader to get people around the table to deal with this deadly issue before it is too late.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_266" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_548">It is not my view or that of the Government that the NPT is defunct.  It is accepted, however, that it faces major challenges and the review conference in 2005 was a grave disappointment.  In September 2005, when the UN reform package was finalised, I echoed the words of Kofi Annan on the NPT.  The fact that there are challenges should not deflect us from encouraging all states to participate in the NPT.</p>
            <p eId="para_549">Under the treaty, it is accepted that countries can have nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.  They have that right and it is not fair to say that countries with that capability can quickly proceed to a military mode.  It is the case that the treaty is under pressure and Ireland, with other countries in the New Agenda Coalition, strongly promotes the review of the NPT constantly.  The proposed agreement between the US and India is one of a series of issues that are not yet finalised and they put pressure on the treaty but we should not remove our focus from the twin approach in the NPT, of which Ireland was an architect many years ago, in less complicated but more dangerous times.  In those days there were only two powers but there is now a multiplicity of powers.  That is why the NPT is based on multilateralism.  It is much better to have countries adopt principles to which we can all adhere, even though we may not agree with them on nuclear energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_550">Ireland is ready, willing and able to provide assistance and we informed the United Nations Secretary General a year ago that we would participate in any effort to try to ensure that the non-proliferation treaty, the twin track policy of non-proliferation and disarmament, should be the hallmark of the approach to the nuclear-military issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_551">Does the Minister agree that there has been an erosion of the main tenets of the non-proliferation treaty which could lead to a cascade of proliferation?  These are not my words but those of a United Nations report published in 2004.  Double standards and sickening hypocrisy are evident with regard to the non-proliferation treaty.  Different standards are applied to Iran as are applied to India, Israel and Pakistan.  Surely it is time for uniformity in global standards on non-proliferation because without it nuclear weapons will inevitably get into the hands of terrorists who will hold democratically elected governments to ransom.  This is not a comic book scenario but a realistic proposition in the event that we do not get our act together.  Waiting until 2010 to hold another round-table conference with no guarantees of success will mean we are too late.  Ireland has a moral right to exert pressure on this matter because, as the Minister agrees, we were the architects of the non-proliferation treaty.</p>

Ireland is one of a number of countries to the fore as regards adherence to the non-proliferation treaty and trying to persuade the international community as a whole to continue on the track of non-proliferation and disarmament.  This can only be achieved in conjunction with other like-minded countries.  I accept that certain countries want to have it both ways.  In my statements to the review conference and the United Nations, I did not put a tooth in my statement that some of the countries that wish to ensure there is non-proliferation are, at the same time, not prepared to disarm.</p>

            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_560">The proposed agreement published by the Governments at St. Andrews comprehensively addressed the core issues standing in the way of the restoration of the power-sharing institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  It sets out a clear way forward for all parties to commit to the full operation of stable power-sharing government and the North-South and east-west arrangements and to full support for policing and the criminal justice institutions, including the policing board.  It also sets out in some detail the practical changes proposed to the operation of the institutions, the arrangements for a financial package and the timetable for implementation of the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">We have asked the parties to confirm acceptance of the agreement by 10 November so that the timetable we have laid out for the nomination of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in November and the restoration of the executive in March can be met.  The timetable provides that, following endorsement of the St. Andrews agreement by the parties, legislation will be passed at Westminster in the week beginning 20 November to address a number of practical changes to the operation of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  These changes arise from the 2004 review of the Agreement and more recent detailed engagement between the parties, including in the preparation for government committee.  This engagement is ongoing and as the parties continue their discussions in the coming weeks, we will closely monitor further developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">The timetable for implementation of the St. Andrews agreement also foresees an electoral endorsement in March next year.  As the Taoiseach stated in this House last week, it is clear from our discussions at St. Andrews that some form of electoral endorsement of the agreement as a whole will be required before the formation of an executive.  The form such an endorsement would take in Northern Ireland is not yet decided, nor is the question of whether a referendum might be required here.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">Before coming to a conclusion on this matter, the Government will want to know that parties are prepared to continue working within the framework we outlined at St. Andrews and to consider the outcome of the discussions between the parties on institutional issues.  These discussions are continuing at Stormont in the framework of the preparation for government committee, which is likely to continue its work at least until the end of this month.  The Government does not intend to rush to judgment in advance of clarity on these points.  Any further developments will then be taken into account by the Attorney General, whose advice will guide our further considerations at Government.</p>

            <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_564">Half of my question was disallowed by the Office of the Ceann Comhairle.  In a communication, the Ceann Comhairle stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_565">I regret that I have had to disallow the underlined part of the following question tabled by you:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_566">To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs<u>the matters in relation to the St. Andrews agreement upon which he sought or is seeking the opinion of the Attorney General; the substance of the opinion as has been received in relation to such matters;</u> if it is the Government’s view that a referendum may be necessary; and if so, his views on the circumstances of such a public consultation.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_567">The Minister has no official responsibility to Dáil Éireann for advice that is sought or received from the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">Although this matter can be pursued elsewhere, I do not agree with the Ceann Comhairle.  Perhaps the Attorney General can be asked a question through the Taoiseach.</p>
            <p eId="para_569">Turning to the practicalities of this issue, I hope the ongoing talks are a success.  My question simply asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if it is the Government's view that a referendum may be necessary.  There are some fundamental issues beyond the finalised text, upon which the Government may have received an opinion.  The British-Irish Agreement is lodged in Article 29.7.2° of the Constitution, while the agreement produced by the multi-party talks is attached to the British-Irish Agreement by way of an annexe.  I do not have time, nor would it be appropriate at Question Time, to discuss whether the two documents form an integral piece.  Is it not possible, on a reading of the Crotty case, to give a straightforward opinion as to whether Article 28, which deals with decision making institutions of this State, is affected in principle by any delegation of executive powers outside the borders of the State?  That is a matter upon which one can have a forward opinion, irrespective of the detail of the final outcome of the talks.</p>
            <p eId="para_570">It is extraordinary that the Attorney General's opinion, whether it exists, cannot be a matter of accountability.  Far more serious, however, is the issue of whether it is possible to have devolved arrangements for decision making which may or may not be affected by Article 28, as understood in the review of the Crotty case, on foot of the fact that the British-Irish Agreement and its annexe, form part of Article 29.7.2° of the Constitution.  On that substantial matter, it is surely important to have an opinion to provide a basic orientation on the issue.  I hope substantial agreement will be reached on a text.</p>

            <p eId="para_573">The Deputy might say that was then and this is now, but it is a fact that the Attorney General is not answerable to this House and Ministers are not answerable for the Attorney General's advice.  The Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">What was agreed at St. Andrew's was a political document.  The document was whittled out after two and a half days of intensive discussions.  Of course, the Attorney General was aware of the contents as they were evolving.  I and the Taoiseach, on separate occasions and together, as well as the Tánaiste, were in contact with the Attorney General's office and the Attorney General personally regarding the ongoing discussions.  It is only a political document.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">Only when the Attorney General sees the colour of the legislation that is proposed by the British and flows from this agreement can he make a determination as to whether a referendum is required on an amendment to an international agreement.  Parties on the other side of the House would be the first to complain if the Government proceeded to make fundamental changes to the Good Friday Agreement.  We will not do this off the tops of our heads or, as some people snidely remarked, for partisan reasons.  We will do it based on the advice of the Attorney General and nothing else.  If the Attorney General advises that a referendum should be held in the South, we will hold one irrespective——</p>

            <p eId="para_590">It is not the colour of the agreement that will decide whether the Government needs an opinion from the Attorney General on a constitutional referendum.  The reason I made specific reference to the Crotty case is that there are circumstances where one could invoke that case and there are other circumstances in which it would not be appropriate to invoke it.  On the basis of the framework opinion relating to, for example, that which is protected constitutionally within Article 28, it is possible to arrive at an opinion that there will be some or any change.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">My case is not solely based on the fact the British-Irish Agreement and annexe are there together or are, in fact, an integral document or that they are simply mentioned in Article 29.7.2 but that any movement would so affect Article 28 that it would make a constitutional referendum necessary.  It may well be the Government decision is to wait to see that upon which it will seek a consultation, but on the general principle as to whether there is, as it were, a disturbance of Article 28's protection of institutional decision-making within the territory that is the State and so forth, one might be able to anticipate that a constitutional referendum will be necessary.</p>

The tenor of the discussion with the Attorney General was in the context of the implications of the Crotty decision and whether the Government can, unilaterally and without reference to the people, make any amendment to the Good Friday Agreement or any international agreement.  We are awaiting the Attorney General's view but his view cannot be given until he sees the legislation relating to the institutional arrangements, particularly those in Strand 1 and Strand 2.</p>

            <p eId="para_594">The annual national address to the UN General Assembly provides an opportunity to set out Ireland's approach to international issues of our day.  In my speech of 26 September, which can be seen on the Department's website and a copy of which I have placed in the Oireachtas Library, I began by acknowledging the contribution of Secretary General Annan and reviewing the progress of UN reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_595">I then moved on to key elements of the Government's approach to development, as set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid which we had launched a few days previously.  I set out in some detail our approach to the situation in Darfur and the Middle East and also referred to Burma, Iran and North Korea.  I emphasised the importance Ireland attaches to the issues of disarmament and human rights.  As is customary, I briefly outlined developments in relation to Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">Finally, I underlined Ireland's commitment to playing a part in conflict prevention and resolution.  I told the General Assembly that, as set out in the White Paper, we had decided to establish an Irish conflict analysis and resolution support unit.  It will seek to harness the experience, resources and expertise generated by the peace process in Northern Ireland, our involvement in peacekeeping and the Irish Aid programme.  Detailed proposals regarding the organisation and work programme of the new unit are being developed within my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_597">In the Minister's wide ranging speech he said there was a need for further restrictions on the use of cluster bombs.  Is this not just a pious platitude?  Should we not be calling for a ban on cluster bombs?  Is it not the case that currently Irish troops are in Lebanon assisting Finnish troops in clearing up the more than 1 million cluster bombs there?  Should we not learn from that experience?  Is it not the case that cluster bombs are part of the arsenal of the new EU battle group?  Looking at all the evidence, should the Minister not be much stronger in his comments and have a more defined goal?  Should he not call for a ban on cluster bombs?</p>
            <p eId="para_598">The Minister indicated that Ireland supports an arms trade treaty.  This is welcome.  Is it not the case that Amnesty International has produced a number of reports which show that Ireland is already involved in the arms trade through dual-use weaponry?  Indeed, according to that organisation, we have become involved, through dual-use exports, in conflicts in Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone.  Has the Minister spoken to his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Martin, about the arms brokering legislation which was promised for this autumn, although there is still no sign of it?  Can the Minister discuss that legislation?  This is an important issue for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">I was amazed that there was no mention of Iraq in the Minister's speech.  What is the Irish Government's position on Iraq?  When 100,000 people protested in the streets of Dublin, the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, said Ireland opposed the war.  Are we opposed to this futile war in Iraq and does the Minister believe the United States and its allies should withdraw?</p>

            <p eId="para_601">There is a multinational force in Iraq.  The UN, by unanimous vote of the Security Council, authorised the continuation of the multinational force.  This is something the Deputy and his colleagues tend to forget.  When America and the UK originally entered Iraq, we did not support their action.  However, the UN subsequently passed a number of resolutions — the most recent of these was the subject of a unanimous vote — to allow Iraq to be rebuilt and to permit the Iraqi people to assume responsibility for their destiny.  The international force is in place, with a full UN mandate with which we comply.  Regardless of whether the Deputy likes it, that is the Government's position.</p>

Ireland, along with a number of countries, proposed that the restrictions on the use of cluster bombs be tightened dramatically.  In the context of what took place in the Lebanon in recent months, we condemned the use of cluster bombs.  It was as a result of what we learned was happening in the Lebanon that we proposed, at the most recent meeting of the convention, that the use of cluster bombs against innocent civilians be severely restricted.</p>

We have not made a decision on the deal because we must wait to see what will be the implications.  We are concerned that it will have implications for the non-proliferation treaty, NPT.  Much work remains to be done.  I understand that the process to put the deal through the US Congress has not yet been decided and that it will probably be next year before anything happens in this regard.

          the funding for Irish emigrant groups in England providing services for Irish emigrants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [34675/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_308" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_613">The strong commitment of the Government to support the Irish community abroad is reflected in the unprecedented level of funding secured for emigrant services.  This year, €12 million is available for that purpose.  This figure represents an increase of 45% on 2005 and is 12 times greater than the allocation in 1997 when the Government came to office.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">The interests and needs of the Irish community in Britain continue to be a matter of particular importance for the Government.  Most of the available funding is directed to organisations there that are engaged in a wide range of community care activities of benefit to Irish people.  Increased funding is having a very tangible and positive effect.  So far this year, 142 organisations in Britain, of which 129 are located in England, have received grants amounting to €8 million.  I am delighted that our support is extending beyond the major cities and is, for the first time, reaching Irish community groups in many towns.</p>
            <p eId="para_615">While the primary emphasis of funding continues to be on supporting frontline welfare services, I am pleased that the additional allocation has also made it possible to support a number of capital projects as well as projects that support our community in Britain in its wish to express its Irish identity.  Further applications for funding are under consideration and I look forward to making an announcement shortly on additional grants.  By the end of this year, I expect that funding to the Irish community in Britain will have reached the unprecedented amount of €9 million, an increase of some 25% on last year's figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">The funding I have outlined forms an element of a much wider picture of the Government's engagement with our community in Britain.  Officials of the embassy and consulates, as well as those in the Irish abroad unit of my Department, will continue to work closely with our community organisations in Britain and elsewhere.  In this way, we can ensure that they have a very direct channel to Government and that our response to their needs will be effective in the period ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_617">I appreciate the increase in funding in recent years, but this is only a small amount.  What plans are in place to provide additional funding beyond this year?  The Minister indicated that he hopes to make further announcements shortly.  Is it proposed to provide a substantial increase in funding so that the many groups with which I and others met can ensure that they can properly address the major issues facing Irish emigrants in their 50s, 60s, 70s and even 80s who are living in squalor and who are isolated?  Some of these people wish to return to Ireland, while others are seeking an improvement in their quality of life.  Are there plans to deliver more packages of the sort that were previously in place in order to encourage or help some Irish emigrants to return home?  When I met representatives of the Irish emigrant groups last year, one of the issues put to me was people's desire to return home to the small communities from which they came and perhaps live out the rest of their lives there.  These people subsidised the economy when times were hard in this country.</p>

            <p eId="para_618">As stated earlier, €9 million will be given to community groups in Britain this year.  I can safely say that a greater allocation will be made next year in order to honour our commitment to dramatically increase the funding.  As already indicated, that funding has increased 12 times since the Government came to office.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">It is not often taken into account that when I was Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I made changes in respect of pre-1953 contributions.  The latter allowed Irish pensioners, not only those in this country but also their counterparts abroad, to gain benefit from stamps they paid prior to 1953.  This year alone, €67 million will be paid to 14,000 Irish pensioners under this scheme.  The scheme to which I refer has been criticised by the Comptroller and Auditor General since its inception, but I make no apology for it.  The pensioners to whom it relates made contributions but did not gain the benefit of them.  The vast majority of pensioners who benefit from it are elderly emigrants living in Britain and the €67 million to which I refer will be added to their relatively small British pensions.  In my view, that is one of the greatest reasons that the circumstances of Irish people living in Britain have changed dramatically.  I accept, however, that difficulties still exist.  There has been a dramatic decrease in the number of Irish homeless in Britain, according to a recent report.  An official with the Simon Community stated in August that the number of homeless Irish in the six inner-city boroughs had fallen from 600 in 1999 to just 100 this year.  He attributed the decrease to the Government's DION projects.  He stated that millions of pounds had gone into supporting the Irish to get them off the streets of London and that this has had a very positive impact.  He also stated that the Government had done its bit and that the Irish taxpayer had really helped.</p>

The groups serving Irish emigrants in Britain realised that the buildings they are replacing will be used by a number of groups.  The predominant group may well be Irish so the funding may be in the form of capital partnerships and so on.  These partnerships will be multi-ethnic.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">I entirely agree with the Minister about the pre-1953 issue.  The fact is that 1956 is the year in which most people left Ireland since the Famine — 56,000 people left.  A quarter of a million people left between 1955 and 1960, so the 1953 revision helps those people.</p>

            <p eId="para_626">There are many ethnic groups being dealt with in most of the major Irish emigrant centres.  I want the system to be as flexible as possible and I suggested to my officials that as we had built the funding up to a critical mass, we should provide some small capital grants.  Emigrant centre officials have told me that if they could inform the local authority in London, Manchester or wherever that they had obtained funding from the Irish Government, the local authorities in the UK would follow on.  That has been beneficial.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">The situation in the US on the legislation for emigrants is a source of disappointment, but we are keeping a close eye on it.  I was in the US recently where I met representatives of the ILIR, the lobby group for Irish emigrants.  I also met representatives of emigrant advice centres and we are keeping a close eye on things.  The legislation is not dead.  The mid-term elections have knocked all legislation off course, including the US-India agreement.  We will come back to it, but I do not know whether we will come back to it as before or find another way of doing it.</p>

            <p eId="para_637">He was not in any way magnanimous while he was here.  We had hoped that he might start off with a certain amount of magnanimity, but we will have to see how things progress.  This amendment is important for the same reason I mentioned previously.  It requires that the Minister be accountable to the House, and I have been pursuing this theme throughout the Bill.  It relates to the lack of accountability to the House and the lack of ability of Members of the House to raise questions that are relevant to this Bill or any similar legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">The Bill will be activated in segments and, in discussion on the previous amendment, we noted those segments that will not come into operation except on a phased basis, which is fine.  The Minister mentioned that these parts of the Bill would come into operation by way of an order which would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is fine, but it does not address the issue.  There is an urgent need for a greater degree of accountability and a greater degree of relevance for the House regarding this and other Bills.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">Since I first became a Member of this House, I have seen a gradual dismissal of Members of the House on all sides and the gradual growth of the amorphous mass, previously in the hands of the Minister, which is now delegated or relegated to various groups and bodies.  The Minister will have no responsibility to the House for these groups and bodies.  When we put down a question in the Dáil, we are told that the question is not a matter for the Minister, but for the commissioner or somebody else who has not been elected and is only accountable to the House once a year through the Committee of Public Accounts or other relevant committee.  That is unsatisfactory.  I do not want to delay the progress of this Bill through the House, but this is being repeated again and again, and as long as I am in the House — depending on the whim of the people one can never tell when that might end — I will repeat that point again and again.</p>

            <p eId="para_642">These amendments are not accepted as they would have the net effect of interfering with the independence of the regulator and would add an unnecessary bureaucratic layer to the process and the date of delivery of the single electricity market.  It is considered that the CER is already sufficiently accountable under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 with regard to the performance of its duties to a joint committee of the Oireachtas.  It should also be noted that given that the single electricity market is a South-North matter, with considerable political issues to be addressed prior to it being established, we should refrain as a rule from anything that might impact upon this to the detriment of the overall process.  Deputy Durkan referred to coming back to the House.  I am sure they will have at least one seat in his constituency.</p>

            <p eId="para_643">I will do my best but one can never be sure of anything, although I am sure the Minister of State would like to do his best to accommodate the amendments.  I do not accept the independence of the regulator.  It is a crazy and outlandish notion.  As has been evident in the past few weeks, regulators make decisions about the prices of electricity and gas against a backdrop of oil prices falling internationally.  In one case, oil was available free on the London market.  If one had a bucket, one could have loaded it up and taken it home.  Against that backdrop, the regulator was able to increase the prices of electricity and gas, yet the Minister of State says the regulator should be independent.  I have no doubt that the regulator, like Ministers, should be highly accountable to the House.  This has nothing to do with politics but with accountability in so far as the provision of a vital and urgent utility service is a serious issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">I do not wish to lose the objectivity of the debate but there are serious issues looming on the horizon if the Department is of the view that regulators are the ultimate in terms of accountability, wisdom and infallibility.  I refer to another recent situation where whole swathes of people with telephone and broadband services were disconnected at the wave of a wand, arbitrarily and without warning.  I do not accept that the regulator is the ultimate decision-maker, or should be seen as such, and I fully recognise the sensitivities of the North-South arrangement and the single market.  Political responsibility rests here and also with the Northern authorities.  I am certain they would be the first to say they would wish to have some degree of accountability in these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">I re-emphasise my belief that the amendment is meritorious.  The Minister made some accommodating noises earlier in the House that something similar might be incorporated at some stage in the Bill.  I do not know how they will be transposed into law but we are looking forward hopefully.</p>

It is important to maintain the independence of the regulator on tariff decisions to avoid political interference.  There has been criticism of political interference which would undermine the necessary investments in the network.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">With regard to the delegation of functions to the CER, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources can and does call the CER to account for its performance of these delegated functions.

There would be serious political embarrassment if we persist with the notion that we should have this so-called degree of impartiality by setting up a series of groups and agencies with responsibilities that were previously invested in the Minister and in the House and which are gone.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_662">In page 5, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_663">"(7) In exercising its powers under section 9 of the Electricity Act, the Commission shall include an obligation on the DSO to facilitate full value net metering for renewable energy supply generators below 5kW.".</p>
            <p eId="para_664">One of the most important developments needed in the new energy future is the use of smart electronic and communications equipment to reduce our unnecessary use of energy and the peaks in energy demand and to allow the flow back of energy from small scale generation to help balance out and cover the increasing difficulty between meeting capacity needs and demand and the available capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">One of the reasons we have such expensive electricity is the daily peak demand between 5.30 p.m. and 7 p.m. every evening as people turn on their kettles to prepare their tea.  Anything we can do to reduce this demand will make a significant saving in the use of emergency generation.  This can be achieved by the use of smart electronic communications systems which switch off unnecessary devices at peak times.  Just as easily, the same circuitry could be used to allow small scale generation of less than 5 kW to power up and provide generation at peak times where it would be economic given the high costs of peak power generation or to allow people investing in such renewable technologies the option to provide power at any other time.  That would be a hugely progressive development in our energy future.  The amendment is simple.  The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has avowedly said he supports net metering.  The only response we get whenever we suggest particular concepts is that reports have been commissioned and consultation documents initiated and that the Government is in the middle of one on this issue at present.  We are beyond consultation and reports and we need to start acting on the basis of the rapidly increasing electricity prices and the supposed desire of the Government to achieve 30% use of renewables by 2020.  I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment as it would allow the commission the authority to oblige the DSO to move towards the net metering system in place in many other countries.  I am interested to hear the Government's arguments given that it is supposed to be in favour of such a progression but is against providing for it in the Bill, which is the right and proper location, to ensure that the Legislature and the Executive start to run the energy system rather than our agencies which seem to lack the confidence to make real decisions and instead issue reports and consultation documents.</p>

            <p eId="para_666">I strongly support the amendment tabled by Deputy Ryan and commend him on introducing it.  One of the big disappointments of the recent Green Paper on Energy was that it did not contain any reference to micro-generation and the application of smart metering systems.  Many critical areas in energy were not dealt with in the Green Paper but I hope that will be remedied subsequently.  I will have some harsh things to say about the Commission for Energy Regulation on subsequent amendments.  I was heartened a few days ago when the Commission for Energy Regulation published its arrangements for a micro-generation consultation paper which, at least, began the discussion at a formal level of micro-generation here.  The disappointing aspect of the consultation paper is that it shot down the development of spill net metering.  I have received e-mails and telephone calls from citizens all over the country who are disappointed that CER seemed to take the wrong angle on this just as the debate was starting.  It looked at the options in the report in terms of metering and mentioned, for example, net metering, non-interval import-export meters, interval meters and smart meters.  It appears to be concerned at any impact on larger generators.  Therefore, it comes down against what would have been an attractive option.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">This side of the House has put forward a number of proposals for a more distributed electricity network for encouraging householders to begin to look at micro-generation.  I saw the advertisements in B&amp;Q recently for solar panels and other domestic generators.  Commerce is way ahead of the Minister in this regard and, certainly, the United Kingdom has begun to go down the road whereas all we have received so far is a negative consultation paper from CER.  This simple amendment to facilitate full value net metering below 5 kW is reasonable and could start us on the road to an effective micro-generation network and encourage householders and businesses to take responsibility for their energy needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">I said at one of our committee meetings that Thomas Edison, the great inventor in electricity, foresaw a distributed network of electricity generation and usage throughout America.  Perhaps the wheel is beginning to come full circle.  This is an area we should encourage.  I second the amendment.</p>

            <p eId="para_669">The amendment is not being accepted.  We do not object in principle to Deputy Ryan's support of marked electronic metering and the various potential benefits it may bring to energy efficiency.  However, the amendment is premature while the Commission for Energy Regulation is consulting on these issues.  We believe CER is best placed to deal with the technical issues relating to facilitating micro-generation.  The Green Paper on energy policy deals with the higher level policy matters in respect of renewables generally.  The CER paper is in favour of further consideration of smart meters and a detailed consultation paper on this will issue shortly.  We are not against it in principle but the amendment is premature and, therefore, we do not accept it at this time.</p>

            <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_670">Surely the tail is wagging the dog on this.  The Government sets energy policy.  The Minister of State agrees, as the Minister said publicly, that the Government believes this is a step in the right direction.  What he appears to be saying is that the Government is not concerned about small scale generation, that it was not in the Green Paper — for shame — and that the matter will be left to CER.  As Deputy Broughan has indicated, CER's position is remarkably cautious, conservative and backward.  Either the Government is responsible for energy policy or it is not.  The main excuse the Government offered for the problems in recent years were that international prices were responsible and that while it might have wished to do so something differently, ultimately the Commission for Energy Regulation has the authority and the Government cannot give directions to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  Given that it appears the Government agrees with the concept as outlined, and we are legislating in regard to the powers of the commissioner, I find it remarkable that in this instance the Legislature and the Executive are balking at implementing policy in which it believes.  What assurance can the Minister of State give that the consultation process carried out by CER will lead to an outcome with which the Government will be satisfied, given that the Government is avowedly in favour of the intent of this amendment?</p>

            <p eId="para_671">It is interesting that this is precisely what I was referring to in the last amendment, namely who is calling the shots particularly on policy.  Policy should be retained in the hands of the Minister and the House.  There is no point in saying this is European legislation transposed into our legislation.  That is of no benefit to consumers here or those in charge of transmission.  I am familiar with the cautious approach of Eirgrid and the regulators.  We all have a reasonable idea as to the reasons for caution.  What the Minister of State should demand is the scientific evidence and the technical evidence to back up the case.  Is it instability or are there other reasons?  If the Minister of State does not call for the proof and washes his hands of it and leaves the matter to the regulator more power, in terms of dictation of policy, will pass into the hands of regulators and we will walk along in their wake.  I have said previously that there are more regulators here than there were in Texas after the American Civil War.  Lessons were learned about them then that should stand us in good stead.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_339">
            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_672">The public are becoming increasingly interested in this issue, as we have seen from inquiries about greener homes and the possibilities of micro-generation.  In advising constituents on the Minister's leaflets, we often find that major problems arise in trying to transport woodchips for boilers, particularly in urban areas.  I have received calls from constituents which suggest the system is not feasible.  Much work needs to be done on energy efficiency and small-scale generation.  According to his consultation document, the regulator, Mr. Reeves, appears to be waiting for smart meters.  He seems to be saying that because households and businesses do not have smart metering, we cannot have a situation where people are paid for spills.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">Nonetheless, it will be an exciting development if households and businesses are paid for electricity they produce and which spills into the system.  In parts of the United Kingdom, Europe and America, a wonderful situation is envisaged whereby electricity meters will fly backwards.  That would be a wonderful prospect for people, rather than having meters that relentlessly speed up whenever one turns on a switch or misses efficiency measures, such as switching off machines at night.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">I support Deputy Eamon Ryan in this area, which is exciting.  The public and the business sector are ahead of us in this regard, so we should go with them.  Three years ago, I received a bitter complaint from a small business man in Westmeath when he asked why we were waiting for net metering.  Here we are three and a half years later and, as with so many other things, it looks like we will have to wait for the new Administration to do it.</p>

            <from>Mr. Browne</from>
            <p eId="para_675">The Government sets the high-level policy principles and the CER is dealing with the detailed technical measures required to implement these policies.  The consultation paper on micro-generation has been published against a backdrop of technical advantages and increasing interest in this area, which is ongoing.  For that reason we should wait until the consultation process is over.  We are not against the principle to which the three Deputies referred but we should await the outcome of the current consultation process after which the required legislation should be implemented.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_341">
            <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_676">In future, the high-level policy energy principles will not just concern what is happening in the ESB, Bord na Móna or Bord Gáis.  They will concern what is happening in every home and office in the country.  The crucial principle is whether we go to a distributed system using a multiple range of different suppliers for heat, electricity and transport fuels, or whether we stick with the older way of doing things whereby large, single generators provide the bulk of our power.  This is an utterly important and central principle.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">Even if the Minister of State wants to await the outcome of a consultation document from the CER, it is possible for us — as we discussed when dealing with an earlier amendment — to allow for a provision in the Bill and enact it when such a consultation process is finished.  If the Minister of State agrees with the principle but has a problem with timing, it would be eminently feasible for the Government to accept this amendment, thus ensuring that we will not have to come back to the House on this issue.  We know how difficult it can be to get legislation through the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">The House could accept this amendment with the caveat that it would require a ministerial order to be enacted.  In that way, we would be able to start progressing it immediately once the Government came round to making the decision.  This is not a small or marginal issue; it is fundamental to the type of energy we will have in future.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the possibility of making that provision subject to a ministerial order rather than immediate enactment.  That would solve the Minister of State's problem in terms of getting ahead of the game, while giving a clear indication from this House — as all parties seem to have done — that this is the direction in which we want to go.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_345">
            <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_805">I move amendment No. 14:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_806">In page 5, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_807">"(8) Section 3 of the Statutory Instrument No. 60 of 2005, the European Communities (internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005 shall be amended to include the subsection (<i>k</i>) “to nevertheless allow communities who so elect to have only their own supply.”.”.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are similar in intent to the previous amendment in that they seek to improve the possibility of development of renewable electricity supplies.  Amendment No. 14 seeks to give greater flexibility to people wishing to develop their own electricity supply from wind, small-scale hydro, combined heat and power or biomass.  An earlier amendment sought to introduce a similar provision in that we felt it was not necessary for the commission to regulate such electricity production in the same manner as it would in the case of a large-scale power plant provided the safety requirements, which would be managed by the latter sections of the Bill covering the safety procedures for electricity installations, were addressed.  I cannot understand why we should restrict or impede in a bureaucratic or other manner people's development of their own small-scale electricity off-grid supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">Amendment No. 15 may represent a more serious issue for larger-scale producers because it is clear that among the many difficulties facing particularly those involved in the development of wind farms one of the greatest difficulties relates to grid connection.  While slightly complex in its wording, the amendment is intended to allow a wind farm operator to contest with the distribution system operator the standards, costs, method and means of any grid connection to be provided.  For economic reasons we should provide greater flexibility as to the nature, standard and extent of a grid connection available to an operator of a new wind farm, who should be allowed to enter into negotiations for the construction of an alternative connection to the network while meeting the safety and other system requirements that the grid operator would undoubtedly be required to apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">The need for such a provision was brought home to me at the recent annual conference of the Irish Wind Energy Association attended by most of the Deputies on this side of the House and some Deputies from the other side.  One presentation dealt with the question of whether a grid connection should be provided overground or underground.  The grid operator representative at the meeting stated that while cost differences existed, if the grid operator, effectively the ESB, was providing the network connection, in many cases it would be more expensive than if the wind farm operator provided the connection.  We should provide flexibility to allow an operator to negotiate with the network provider to allow connection to proceed in the correct way.  While both are technical amendments, one assists with small-scale generators and the other is of significant importance to wind farm development.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Fahey)</from>
            <p eId="para_811">Neither amendment is acceptable.  The wording of amendment No. 14 would not be consistent with the requirement under EU and Irish legislation that all customers should be free to choose their supplier.  On amendment No. 15, I am not necessarily against the proposal to extend contestability of connections to the distribution system level in principle if it can deliver more efficiency and competition.  However, further consideration must be given to a legislative underpinning of this provision.  In particular this wording may not be consistent with EU and Irish legislation on terms and conditions for third-party access to the electricity grid.  Those issues need to be carefully considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">This section, dealing with the functions of the CER regarding the all-island market, is not necessarily the place to address these matters legislatively.  This issue will be factored into the ongoing work to transpose EU Directive 2003/54/EC on the distribution system operator unbundling.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_347">
            <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_813">I understand the unbundling of the distribution system must be accomplished by July 2007.  I hope this or a future Government does not find itself required to make a regulatory change through legislation, which we have the opportunity to make now.  The Minister of State appears to agree with the intent of amendment No. 15, but has some issues with the wording or the legal aspects of achieving that principle.  It would have been possible for the Minister to introduce a similar amendment that met those technical legal requirements.  My wording attempted to outline the principle.  I do not understand why the Government would be in favour of the principle while arguing it is contrary to existing legislation.  It would not be impossible to surmount that problem through alternative legal wording, possibly drafted by the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">The Minister of State has acknowledged the problem with lack of flexibility, which may need to be resolved in the unbundling of the distribution system, regardless of the provisions we have regarding the transmission system operator.  While recognising the problem with the lack of flexibility, I regret that the Government sees fit to sit on its hands, decide to do nothing about the issue and wait for some future opportunity to make the change.  If this is not the appropriate place for an amendment to the powers of the CER, where can it take place?  Does the Minister of State believe it would be necessary to introduce legislation to allow for what is known as contestability in the distribution or transmission connection?  When does the Government intend to allow for such legislation?</p>

            <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
            <p eId="para_815">While the Deputy's proposal has some merit, further consideration would need to be given before providing for it in legislation.  Unbundling of the DSO is required by July 2007 and legislation, most likely secondary legislation, will be required to deal with a range of issues necessary for the legal unbundling of the DSO.  We would be prepared to give further consideration to the Deputy's proposal in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_819">I am advised that "the island of Ireland" is defined in section 3 in the context of and for the sole purpose of the regulation of an all-island wholesale electricity market, as set out in the Long Title of the Bill and as prescribed in subsection 3(6), and for no other purpose.  This definition is drafted to ensure account is taken of the islands within the Irish jurisdiction in developing an all-island electricity market.  As the definition is provided solely for the purpose of this section of the Bill, it could never be invoked in respect of other matters such as fisheries and mineral exploration rights.  Therefore, a more detailed definition of "Irish seas" is not necessary for the purpose of this legislation.</p>

          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_351">
            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_820">I fail to understand that.  Perhaps I just do not have the right angle on it.  I thought my amendment presented a useful opportunity, particularly because it is considered useful to aspire to having an all-island energy policy.  Such a policy would bring about the co-operation of the two regulatory authorities in the North and South and would bring recognition that it is better to have an all-island market than two separate ones.  We may yet become part of an all-island and part-European market, in which case it will be of benefit to have accepted my amendment.  For example, energy resources off our shores could comprise a very contentious issue in the years to come.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">While there is no specific definition of our seas in the legislation, somebody could ask in the future why such a definition was not included and state it would have been very useful.  I remember a frantic group of people crawling onto the island of Rockall half way out in the Atlantic some years ago.  Does the Ceann Comhairle remember that?  Such an issue could become very contentious and I therefore tabled my amendment.  If the Minister of State is absolutely certain it is not required or is superfluous, I will not press it.  Perhaps he will look into his heart and consider accepting it.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">There have been more changes of Minister since morning than changes of the guard and I have no doubt there will be more personality changes before the day is out.</p>

            <p eId="para_828">Amendment No. 17 in the name of Deputy Durkan arises from Committee Stage proceedings.  Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are related and they may all be discussed together.</p>

          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_358">
            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_829">I move amendment No. 17:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_830">In page 5, line 34, to delete "services" and substitute "services affecting other forms of home heating".</p>
            <p eId="para_831">The legislation, as it stands, reads:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_832">‘market in energy' includes a market in respect of—</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_833">(<i>a</i>) the generation, supply, transmission, distribution and trading, including the export or import, of electricity, including electricity generated from renewable sources,</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_834">(<i>b</i>) the storage, supply, transmission, distribution and trading, including the export and import, of natural gas,</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_835">(<i>c</i>) energy efficiency services.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">There is no specific reference to "home heating" or the heating of the structures of buildings and such a reference should be included.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">We had a debate this morning on whether this is a regulatory or an energy Bill.  It could be very helpful if specific reference were made to "home heating" simply because the largest single saving that can be made in the use of energy, particularly imported oil, is in the area of home heating.  Without a doubt, this also applies to gas.  Ireland has some gas supplies including a resource that is expected to last 15 years.  I hope we will ultimately avail of it and that we will be able to turn on the tap.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">We should afford to "home heating" the recognition it deserves.  There is a plethora of areas of energy provision in addition to home heating, but in no other area can greater efficiency, greater import substitution and a greater reduction in the cost to the consumer be achieved.  The same applies to heating in the commercial sector.  The amendments under discussion therefore deserve recognition and I ask that the Minister of State be sufficiently good, warm-hearted, energetic and conscious of conservation to take them on board.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_359">
            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_839">We are dealing with the role of CER in developing an all-island market.  Colleagues mentioned that we are not really sure what will happen.  Representatives of the Northern Ireland regulatory body were before the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources approximately six months ago and it was clear that the body regulates its side of the Border.  On 1 November next year I presume the two regulators will work hand in hand.  By definition, it seems one cannot have two regulators in a single market.  It would be like having two European Commissions and therefore we will need to discuss having a single regulator.  As my colleague stated, Commissioner Piebalgs was thinking of amalgamating the UK and Irish markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">The amendments address a very important section.  I commend the role the Government has taken thus far in developing this sector.  It is a concrete example of the Republic and Northern Ireland working together for the good of the peoples both North and South.  I hope further interconnection will lead to a better future.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">When representatives of the Commission for Energy Regulation were before the joint committee discussing this very point, the then commissioner, who has since become a water commissioner in the United Kingdom, said to me that the single market's impact would be such that future prices would be less than they would be if there were no single market.  This reminds me of a comment by a former leader of Fine Gael, Professor Garret FitzGerald.  When he became Taoiseach, he had a famous mantra to the effect that the increase in the level of prices was falling.  The public had to get its head around the idea that things would be much dearer but not as dear as they would have been in other circumstances.  This is crazy to the ordinary householder.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">In the context of the future amalgamation of the regulatory functions in the North and the Republic, such that there would be a unified all-island regulator, one must not only consider energy efficiency, storage, generation, security of supply and sustainability but also measures to alleviate fuel and energy poverty.  In other words, the regulator should be concerned about the impact it is having on the households of this island.  It should be provided for legislatively that it should be part of the regulator's duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">During Question Time last Thursday, I suggested to the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that he should either accept my amendment to this section of the Bill or introduce further legislation to make it essential that a consumer panel be established within the Commission for Energy Regulation.  I am in favour of the establishment of a panel of people, including experts and economists, who represent householders and businesses.  I refer in particular to small businesses, which are being crucified, as we know, by the increases in electricity prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">One of the most horrible things to have happened to people in this country in recent years happened on 1 October last, which was the day we trooped over to Government Buildings to be presented with the Green Paper on energy by the Taoiseach.  The media were interested to know how many Ministers would turn up to sit beside him on the day that was in it because it was the same day the Minister allowed the Commission for Energy Regulation to increase gas prices by 34%.  We were going in to talk about a bright energy future, but we were hit with a whammy of a gas increase of 34% on every household.  One of the most interesting aspects of the events of 1 October was that the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, not only produced the Green Paper but also slipped out the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.</p>

            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_850">The Minister tried to cover all the bad news with his shining Green Paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">The Deloitte &amp; Touche report contains a great deal of analysis of the ESB.  It examines various issues relating to the market, which we are discussing in this amendment and this section, in a professional and thorough manner.  The most interesting thing in the report, which was produced by a hard-headed consultancy company, is that one fifth of the people suffer fuel poverty.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle, with his medical background, will agree that is an extraordinary statistic.  One fifth of the people of this country are suffering some degree of fuel poverty.  This is a key issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">How can Mr. Reeves and Mr. Tutty tell us that there will be an increase of 34%?  It seems, as Mr. David Begg and my party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, said last week, that prices are being greatly increased in the expectation of bringing about competition at some future time.  The problem, as we know from a study conducted by the department of social studies and sociology in UCD, is that some people will never enjoy those lower prices because they will not be around.  One of the reasons they will not be around is that they will not survive our cold winters.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will agree that the last two winters were among the hardest we can remember.  Perhaps they were the two coldest winters of our lifetimes.  Some people could not afford to turn on the gas central heating or to get an extra fill of oil.  I am sure the Minister of State met such people when he was travelling around his constituency of Galway West.  I have often walked into the freezing kitchens of houses owned by older people who are afraid to turn on their heating, which is an incredible commentary on our situation towards the end of 2006, after ten years of amazing economic growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">I am sure the Minister of State privately agrees with me that we should have a requisition on the Commission for Energy Regulation to consider the alleviation of fuel poverty as a key element of its work.  It should not be something that it can choose to consider.  I do not have the commission's consultation and decision documents on the increases of 34% in gas prices and 20% in electricity prices with me, but perhaps I should bring them in.  Mr. Reeves and his colleagues said they approved the increase in gas prices because the increase in the price of imported gas over the previous two seasons meant that Bord Gáis was unable to get the return it needed.  If one examines the company's accounts for 2005, one will see that the company made a profit of over €100 million.  It is refurbishing the network throughout the country.  Many places on the north side of Dublin are being dug up by Bord Gáis as it installs its upgraded future system.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">The ESB, similarly, passed on a huge dividend of €77 million to the Government last year, from profits of €270 million.  It is a remarkable, well-led, dynamic and forward-looking company.  An additional increase of 20% in electricity prices will be faced by the public on 1 January next.  In a few weeks, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, will deliver his Budget Statement from where the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is currently sitting.  I hope he will announce significant increases in social welfare benefits, the amount of electricity units and a range of social protections.  The Government certainly has the money to make such increases.  A few weeks later, however, on 1 January, just as benefits such as the State pension start to enter people's bank accounts and post office accounts, people will find they have to pay much more for their energy.  This is a critical issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">During the past five years of this Administration, there have been increases of 100% in the price of gas and over 60% in the price of electricity.  We have had to deal with amazingly high prices to establish a future in which we will supposedly have much lower prices.  Like many social commentators, I do not understand the logic that is operating at present.  The deliberate decision to keep energy prices low was a key factor in the establishment of the Celtic tiger economy we have enjoyed, which has brought most people to a level of affluence.  We have not seen the benefits of the EU requirements we have had to meet.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">I have one of the Commission for Energy Regulation consultation documents with me, but I do not have the key decision document with me.  The documents should have included a lengthy commentary on the measures which could have been taken to alleviate poverty, which would have resulted in a much lower increase in gas prices — perhaps in the single digits — for this season.  As my colleague said, the price of energy supplies, including gas, decreased during a remarkable period over the last couple of months.  As the Minister of State knows, there were a number of days when the Norwegian pipeline was spewing out gas that was free on the London market.</p>

            <p eId="para_859">If we had the resources, in the form of storage capacity, we could have had free gas for half of next year.  We have an opportunity to provide for measures which will require the Commission for Energy Regulation to consider this issue as the all-island market develops.  People sometimes say that poverty measures should only be discussed in terms of the budget — they should be examined in terms of how one can help pensioners, people on low incomes and great social organisations like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which are trying to alleviate poverty.  This issue is central to the point I am making.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">People would not be so hard-pressed if fuel prices were lower.  I believe the prices this year should have been lower.  The members of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources argued to Mr. Reeves a couple of weeks ago that lower prices could be sustained.  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 18.  He should include this measure in the Bill to demonstrate that this House and the Government are serious about combatting energy poverty, rather than crucifying the poorest people in society, such as those on the lowest incomes, in 2007.  The Government will reap a tough reward for its approach when election day comes.</p>

            <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
            <p eId="para_861">It is not that I do not have a good heart.  This section simply delineates the functions of the Commission for Energy Regulation in the development of the single electricity market.  Further and more detailed provisions will be included in the all-island energy market Bill, which is being drafted in co-operation with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  We hope the Bill will be introduced in the House shortly.  The proposed amendments are simply not appropriate to this section of the current Bill as they do not relate specifically to the development of an all-island market for the trading of electricity.  The amendments are unnecessarily restrictive in so far as they seek to confine energy efficiency services to forms of home heating.  As Deputy Broughan indicated, such measures are instruments of social policy.  While they may be applied to a market situation, they are not part of the definition of the energy market.  The term "as may, from time to time, be determined by the Minister" is superfluous and the term used at section 14(1)(<i>e</i>) is all-embracing.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">While I take the point made by the Deputies, the energy service sector is wider than home heating and extends to industry and commercial endeavours.  It includes the provisions of the Energy Services Directive and the energy efficiency service providers.  For this reason I cannot accept these amendments.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_369">
            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_863">The Minister of State is not being very accommodating.  I thought he would make sweeping changes and recognise the good ideas proposed.  The three amendments in question all relate to a specific part of what we feel should be covered in this new single market.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">The purpose of the words "as may, from time to time, be determined by the Minister" in amendment No. 19, as mentioned by the Minister of State, is to indicate who is in control.  Will we have to wait, as in recent weeks, for a decision from the regulator?  He had the flu and we had to wait until it had passed for a decision to be made.  Policy should always be determined by the Minister, regardless of what anyone else says, including the European transposition and so on.  We cannot sit easily with a situation whereby regulation takes precedence over policy.  Policy is required within this State.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">There is a vast difference between how energy supply, demand and transmission is conducted here and in the rest of Europe.  This is, effectively, the only island involved as Britain has a tunnel to the mainland that is somewhat better than the tunnel we have here.  I understand that services are transmissible via the tunnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">It is easier to regulate in mainland Europe as it concerns a far larger area and many systems of transmission are already in place.  Regulators may represent a better method for approaching this issue because there are many different authorities that can be brought together.  Ireland's position is different and the regulatory system, as transposed into Irish law, is flawed and will leave us vulnerable.  So far we have not had a negative experience but if there was a sharp cold snap and there were difficulties with supply, regulation, transmission and so on, would we sit by and leave everything to the regulator until he or she decided the problem could be resolved?  At this point there must be recourse to Government policy.  After all, who are the elected representatives and who will be accountable?</p>
            <p eId="para_867">Suppose there was an outage of the nature that affected the telecom industry in recent weeks.  There is no use saying it could not happen; Deputy Broughan has already pointed out that it can happen.  There is a dramatic difference between energy requirements in cold weather and otherwise.  Given these circumstances it is time to introduce to this Bill an indication from the Minister of State that we intend to maintain responsibility for policy, rather than divest ourselves of all control.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">For all of the regulation on the Continent there were many power outages around Europe last summer, in Spain, Italy and elsewhere.  If it can happen there it can happen as easily here, and ours is a far colder climate.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_370">
            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_869">I have reviewed the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 which established the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  The CER's functions were to publish, pursuant to a policy direction or directions of the Minister proposals for a system of contracts and other arrangements, to engage in a public consultation process, to advise the Minister on the impact of electricity generation in relation to sustainability, and international agreements and so on.  There are many vague, general functions but nothing that covers the impact of CER's decision on vulnerable consumers.  There is a reference to the commission having regard to the needs of various elements and this relates particularly to producers, generators, licence holders and so on.  In the 1999 Act, under the commission's functions, it is stated it must take account of the protection of the environment, the efficient use of electricity, the needs of rural customers, the disadvantaged and the elderly.  However, the CER has never advanced a mechanism whereby it would do this.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">I am studying developments that would, from a market point of view, address the almost certain fuel and energy poverty we will see in the forthcoming winter.  This poverty will be due to the Government's decision to allow CER, under current legislation, to deliver a double whammy consisting of a 34% increase in gas prices and a 20% increase in electricity prices in addition to the increases of 100% that have been seen in the lifetime of this Government.  Greater intervention is required by the Government in relation to CER's powers.  The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 was the major Act relating to market regulation since the Electricity Supply Act 1927, which established the Electricity Supply Board.  The Bill before us gives us an opportunity to put the needs of consumers, families and small businesses at the centre of CER's thinking, rather than existing as an afterthought as is the case in the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">I urge the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 18 and I also support amendment No. 17.  We need a mechanism to make CER more responsive to vulnerable consumers.</p>

          <speech by="#FrankFahey" eId="spk_371" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
            <p eId="para_872">Government policy is clearly set out in the Green Paper on energy policy.  The development of further physical interconnection and the integration of our energy market with our neighbours' through the development of the Single European Market, SEM, and regional energy markets is a cornerstone of Government policy.  The amendments proposed by the Deputy do not fit with the section dealing with the SEM.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">Legislation dealing with vulnerable customers has already been introduced and measures to deal with fuel poverty are set out in the energy policy Green Paper.  The vulnerable customers' payment and assistance scheme sees the ESB and Bord Gáis help vulnerable customers.  Those facing financial hardship should not allow their accounts fall into arrears but should contact their service provider as soon as possible to agree a payment plan.  Service will not be withdrawn where there is an agreed payment plan in place and payments are kept up to date in accordance with the agreed plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">Further to what Deputy Broughan has said, there is scope for lessening home heating costs through the warmer home scheme, which is part of Sustainable Energy Ireland's low cost income housing programme.  The purpose of this scheme is to improve the energy efficiency and comfort conditions of homes occupied by low income householders.  The scheme provides funding for community based organisations for the installation of energy efficiency measures, such as attic insulation, draft proofing, hot water cylinder installation and wall cavity insulation, in homes in their respective localities.  The scheme is intended to benefit those most in need and the eligibility criteria vary from region to region depending on the target group of the community organisation in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">We all agree with the Deputy's comments that there is a significant fuel burden on people, particularly low income families, because of the increases in energy costs.  However, this is a worldwide phenomenon and one for which surely the Deputy cannot blame the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">As regards the query on the gas supplier of last resort, the shipper of last resort is provided for later in this Bill.  Bord Gáis Éireann has been appointed to fulfil this role should there be a failure in any other energy provider.</p>

            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_877">Social measures to alleviate energy and fuel poverty are welcome.  I will be looking to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to announce a dramatic panel of proposals on the first Wednesday in December.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">However, the operation of this in practice is rather different and I will give the Minister of State an example.  The Minister of State mentioned some of the measures Bord Gáis Éireann will take and how kind it will be to customers.  In light of the cut-offs some consumers experienced and the way in which some estates were dealt with during the refurbishment programme on the north side of Dublin recently, BGE and its contractors were anything but responsive.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">The Health Service Executive has a programme of home insulation operating on the north side of Dublin.  Funding was provided for this in last year's budget to an organisation called Eastern Community Works.  It is a company of the old northern area health board and its funding for insulating homes for seniors and vulnerable families ran out at the end of April.  Such was the demand last winter that its funding lasted only four months.  Many families who sought resources last winter will face into this winter without the work having been carried out — their houses are still cold.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">The Government did not provide the alleviating moneys to carry out this work.  When I tried to raise this in the House, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, did not want to know about it.  We now effectively have a regulator for health, namely, the Health Service Executive and Professor Brendan Drumm.  Professor Drumm is now effectively the Minister for Health and Children and he is assisted by Mr. Lennon, who sends us nice press releases on the health service almost daily.  I cannot raise this issue with anyone.  When I approached the HSE, it said that it was up to Eastern Community Works to spend the money in a different way.  Although the money ran out in April, the HSE expected the organisation to spread the money over 12 months.  Sufficient resources have not been made available and that is why I am seeking market-based solutions.  I also want the regulator to take account of the 20% of the public that lives in fuel poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">The Minister of State referred to the Green Paper a number of times.  It contains just one page on fuel poverty; there are six lines in the main part of the document and three quarters of a page elsewhere.  The alleviation of poverty for low income families has been one of the tenets of my party throughout its history.  It is a central reason for the existence of my party and we are determined to bring this forward into the area of energy.  As I told the wind energy delegation that met the joint committee, while we welcome renewable and sustainable energies we will not allow the poorest people in society to carry the can for it.  This is not the way it can be, or will be, done.  If we want a proper sustainable energy programme, it must be spread fairly among all sections of society.  The only way to do this is by building in market mechanisms and putting in place market supervision, such as the Commission on Energy Regulation.</p>

            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_882">The Minister of State has rejected the proposal contained in amendment No. 19 which sought to introduce an element of ministerial control.  Section 3(6) lists the various areas in which the bodies will be incorporated, such as energy efficiency services, energy research and development and other sustainable energy activities.  These other sustainable activities are not defined.  This is a weakness and it is the reason for tabling the amendment.  It seeks to give the Minister control and the means to take action.  Of course, Ministers have become shy of becoming involved in such matters because it might mean that they would be held responsible.  It would be really awful if they were expected to take action in the face of a catastrophic fuel shortage.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">Amendment No. 19 would considerably strengthen the Bill.  Failing to ensure that such power is available to the Minister is a mistake.  The phrase "as may, from time to time, be determined by the Minister" is one that has been regularly used in Bills that come before the House, and I am sure it will be used in the future too.  The Minister of State has not accepted this amendment because he does not want direct, dictate, control, or advice on policy.  The longer this continues the worse matters will become.

            <p eId="para_886">I will respond to the points Deputy Broughan has raised, even though they are not relevant to this Bill.  While they are fully understood, they are best dealt with in the context of further policy developments.  Consultations in respect of the energy Green Paper are ongoing and seek to determine what further work should be done to alleviate fuel poverty.  Serious consideration will be given to whatever proposals emerge.  We should stick to the subject matter of the Bill in the meantime.</p>

            <p eId="para_1023">The purpose of my amendments in this group is to improve and refine the proposal to establish a system of examining and monitoring the works carried out by electrical contractors.  While small and technical in nature, the amendments are also important.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">The purpose of amendment No. 22 is to amend the existing provision under which the Commission for Energy Regulation will publish criteria on standards for designated electrical works by adding a further provision that, instead of publishing new criteria on standards, the commission may endorse criteria already established by industry membership bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">The purpose of amendment No. 24 is to provide that the commission may fine electrical contractors rather than having to use the sole sanction of revoking a contractor's membership of a designated body.

            <p eId="para_1026">Amendment No. 26 provides that an appeal arising from a commission decision to impose sanctions on a particular contractor must be submitted within 14 days as opposed to 28 days.

These are not major amendments but they will improve the legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1027">Amendment No. 23 in my name gives the Commission for Energy Regulation a back-handed reprieve by proposing to insert the words, ", or as required", after the words, "The Commission may review or amend the criteria as often as it considers necessary", in section 9(D)(5).  The presumption is that the commission is all-powerful and that its role is to review as often as it considers it necessary.  I do not see what massive foresight the commission has or is likely to have.  Different situations may emerge which would require the Minister or the public to state that some change in the criteria is required.  It could well be in the operation of the criteria that the change is necessary or required.  The commission might not see it as necessary but it could well be required.  The two do not necessarily converge, as we know from previous discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">Acceptance of the amendment would enhance the Bill and would be an indication of the Minister's anxiety to accommodate the House.  Incidentally, this amendment is not unique.  Similar amendments have been incorporated previously in many legislative measures in the House.</p>

          <speech by="#FrankFahey" eId="spk_385" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
            <p eId="para_1029">With regard to amendment No. 22, the use of the term "or endorse" might suggest that responsibility for the criteria document and the important matters it deals with would be removed, at least in part, from the CER.  It must be clear that the CER is fully responsible for the contents rather than simply endorsing them.  With regard to amendment No. 23, the current text of the subsection will ensure that the criteria are updated as often as required, and it is clearly for the CER to determine when this is necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">In response to amendment No. 24, while allowing for fines and other sanctions is acceptable in principle, this is a matter best left to the discretion of the designating body.  The Parliamentary Counsel has indicated that there is a move away from introducing statutory fines other than those imposed by the courts.  There is a wide range of administrative sanctions which may be implemented by a designated body which do not require statutory underpinning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">Turning to amendment No. 30, the matters set out in subsection (10)(<i>a</i>) are not appropriate matters to include in the criteria document.  These relate to how the individual designated bodies charge certain fees to its members and may differ from body to body while the matters set out in the criteria document should be uniformly acceptable to all bodies.  Amendment No. 31 is not required as it is clearly the responsibility of the CER to determine when the safety requirements are required to be updated.  This is already captured in the current text which allows for the CER to update the safety requirements from time to time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">Amendment No. 32 is also not required as subsection (5) already states that the criteria document will include the safety standards to be achieved and maintained by electrical contractors.</p>

            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_1033">The question at issue in amendments Nos. 23 and 31 is whether the regulator is the ultimate authority is determining when something is required, that is, whether it is necessary according to his or her judgment or could otherwise be required.  Does the Minister think, for example, that the increases in gas and electricity prices which were approved recently were necessary and, if so, for what purpose?  What was achieved?  They were not required.  That is the difference in interpretation of the two words.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">The word "required" should be included in the legislation now.  If it is not done now, it will have to be done later.  A situation will arise in which a Minister will have to declare that the regulator is totally independent and that he can no longer influence him or her.  The Minister will have no role or function but will be liable to be called to account publicly for some matter, and if he or she does not give a satisfactory response, they will have a serious problem on their hands.  That is how it will affect the Minister.  Like the decisions that were taken in the last couple of weeks, decisions can be taken under this section relating to the criteria that will be laid down.  There is a similarity.  The simple question is whether they are necessary or required.  It is interesting.</p>

            <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_1035">I commend the Minister's ability on this legislation, which is highly complex and not within the Minister's remit.  I wish to refer to amendment No. 24 which deals with the issuing of fines.  The Minister said it is against parliamentary practice to legislate for fining.  However, this section designates some of the powers or <i>modus operandi</i> of designated bodies, and of the commission in regard to the management of the designated bodies.  Why would it not be appropriate to back up existing practice, that is, a system which has fines, with a regulatory practice which also provides for fines?  Solely having recourse to expelling somebody from a body is possibly too blunt an instrument.  It is more appropriate and possibly equally effective to have a system for fines.  Why would that not make sense in this case?</p>

            <p eId="para_1036">There is a wide range of administrative sanctions which may be implemented by the designating body which do not require statutory underpinning.  There is a difference between allowing for the body to charge a fine to its members and the court enforced fines provided for in this Bill.  The fines in the Bill are for serious safety breaches.  There is also the ability to impose administrative sanctions which does not need legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">With regard to Deputy Durkan's question, clearly the regulator would not have approved the increases if they were not necessary.  Energy prices have fallen but the regulator must have regard to the overall situation.  I am satisfied that the increases that were made are necessary.</p>

Opposition Members, in all their glory, have done their best to amend the Bill as it was presented to them.  We have a number of options open to us at this stage.  We can vote on every amendment from here on if we so wish.  We have tried to accommodate the Minister of State and the Department by not pressing amendments, except in certain selective circumstances.  Perhaps now is as good a time as any to discover whether the Minister of State intends to take on board any of the concerns expressed in the amendments tabled by Opposition Members, particularly in view of the way the Bill has been introduced and recommitted and in light of the fact that we are being obliged to deal with entirely new sections that only emerged after we submitted our amendments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1065">We engaged in a lengthy discussion on Committee Stage regarding specified and designated works.  A number of Members tabled amendments, some of which have been subsumed into the Bill.  I am obliged to disagree with Deputy Eamon Ryan in respect of this matter because the fundamental impetus behind the section is to create, at the highest levels, a safe environment in which electrical and gas works may be carried out.  On Committee Stage, we debated, in great detail with the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the types of works which are specified or designated that could be exempted.  Eventually, the Minister accepted some of the amendments tabled by Opposition Members.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">It is difficult to understand how a precise definition might be arrived at in respect of this matter.  I do not know whether it would be good practice to proceed in the way suggested by Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Even when one considers the most basic works in respect of properly maintaining a house, it is obvious that huge safety issues arise.  The basic tenor of the section is the right way to proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">The Oireachtas committee of which I am a member received a huge number of presentations in the lead-up to Committee Stage of the Bill, one of which was submitted by the Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland, RECI, which was trying to discover the kinds of works that would be included under the Bill.  I would prefer the method used in the Bill rather than adopting a system of exempting certain works.  On Committee Stage, we discussed the area where the work of electricians and plumbers overlap.  I refer, for example, to the installation of a shower.  Is the latter a plumbing job or should it be carried out by an electrician?</p>

I presume that the latter would be dealt with under the new subsection contained in Deputy Eamon Ryan's amendment.  It would be better if works were clearly designated and if there were no exemptions.  I accept that there are grey areas and that handymen who advertise in the local press carry out works such as those to which I refer.  These individuals should be required to do so to the highest standards because that is the reason the section and that relating to gas works were brought forward.</p>

The new section 9D(27), which is inserted into the 1999 Act by section 4 of the Bill, provides that the CER should specify which works are to be the specified works for the purpose of the Act.  Subsection (18) of the same section provides that the commission shall specify the form of completion certificate to be used for particular types of electrical works.  The CER will take into account any and all safety issues when implementing its new powers under these subsections and will ensure, in consultation with RECI or any other such body, that any requirements relating to inspection or certification will be restricted to the activities for which they are appropriate.  I will leave it to the Opposition to decide on the issue of plumbers and electricians.</p>

            <p eId="para_1075">This is a complex area and one may become involved in legal wrangles if works go wrong.  That is why it is important to identify what is a designated and what is a specified work.  Even though, as Deputy Broughan stated, this matter was examined in detail on Committee Stage, there is need for further clarity.  The proposal in this amendment is to provide further clarity by explicitly setting out in a new subsection (15) that where a registered electrical contractor carries out designated electrical works, the contractor would then have to issue a completion certificate.  That ties in with section 9E(1) by setting out what designated electrical works are, which makes sense.</p>

Therefore, they will be subject to completion certificates when necessary.  Designated works will, by their nature, be the electrical works to which the most stringent safety implications are attached.  They can only be carried out by a registered electrical contractor and the proposed section 9E of the 1999 Act contains strict penalty provision to underpin this even further.  As a result, this amendment is not accepted.</p>

I do not agree with the Minister of State's argument that they are both the same thing.

            <p eId="para_1112">There is nothing superfluous, although I will not press the amendment.  Circumstances arose during the summer where I thought it was necessary to further embellish and strengthen the particular line.  I do not wish to go into the details because it was a purely local situation but there are circumstances that could govern the speed with which a particular action would be taken.  The Minister of State is becoming flustered over there.  I hear him sighing.</p>

            <p eId="para_1116">From discussions I had with the trade, I am of the view that a standard form might be more explicit and might indicate more clearly what was in mind.  For example, somebody might decide to introduce their own form.  I know this would never happen, and should never happen, but in situations of this nature, the specified form may be intended in the section but it does not specifically say so.  I hope the Minister of State, in one of his weaker moments, will decide to incorporate it in the section.</p>
            <p eId="para_1117">There is a further reference in amendment No. 40 to the inclusion of a standard checklist.  I ask that this be included because it can be very helpful in determining the basic requirements and areas of contention, particularly with reference to installations, whether they be electrical, gas or plumbing and heating.  Certain basics must be followed and a checklist should be incorporated which would cover some of the queries I had in that area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1118">I may be wrong but I look forward to an explanation by the Department officials in this regard as to when a completion certificate is needed and where we have legislated for the difference between how we treat a "specified" work or a "designated" work.  This may well exist in the legislation but I may have missed it.  This could be pointed out to me separately, given that the Minister of State is not willing to point out where that difference applies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">What is the harm in my amendment which proposes that the commission would also set out the circumstances in which a completion certificate may be granted or withheld as well as the procedures to be followed and the records to be maintained in that regard?  Would this not provide a cover-all in case we have inadvertently missed something in this complex arrangement of designation of different types of works and provide the commission with the authority to sort out any such difficulties that may arise in the future?</p>

The various procedures to be followed by registered electrical contractors will be specified in detail in the criteria document to be prepared by CER.  It should be noted that, as a rule, completion certificates must be issued by contractors for any specified work carried out by them.  With reference to what Deputy Ryan said, it cannot be more clear than that.  Specified works require a completion certificate.  These will be specified by CER and will not include minor matters such as some of the issues raised by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">Designated works are those works which, if carried out by a person who is not a registered contractor, will incur an offence which carries a fine.  These works will be designated by CER and will be the more complex works which give rise to greater safety concerns.</p>

I question the sense of that.  I do not see why it should not be possible for a duly appointed inspector to assess work carried out by someone who belongs to a different industry body.  There will be a difficulty in respect of who carries out the inspection when an electrical contractor who is a member of one body moves to another body.

Why is it necessary to have a system where a member from the same body does the work?   Is there not sufficient trust in the industry where the inspection carried out by an alternative body, if there are to be two, would be seen as objective and not biased?  Do we need to have a home referee on every occasion for the inspection?  Is it not possible in the designation of certain bodies to ensure there is a certain amount of trust and co-operation in the industry in order that one inspector, regardless of who is the electrical contractor, is seen to be above board and correct?  It is strange that it has to be regulated in that way.</p>

I presume it is intended that the regulations will be laid before the House, but there will be no debate in the House and the general wisdom that will determine what those regulations might be will come not from the Opposition or the House, it will come from the Minister by virtue of his regulations.  This matter was raised previously by Deputy Ryan.  The Minister says it is implied.  If he ever goes to court and tells the judge that something was implied, he could have a problem.  Perhaps he will look again at that amendment and take into account what Deputy Ryan said on previous amendments in regard to the designated electrical works.

            <p eId="para_1157">The issue of the approval by Dáil Éireann of important developments in ministerial orders has been raised several times today and in the previous debate.  I appreciate the Minister of State's portfolio is the Department of Education and Science.  Ministerial orders and regulations are laid before the Houses.  We receive them or they are left in the Dáil Library for 21 days, but it is difficult for us to keep track of them.  Yesterday, for example, we got an extraordinary note from Mr. Toibín, Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, stating that a ministerial order was made transferring a chunk of the Department of the Marine to the Department of Transport but that the transfer was a mistake.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">All the fishery harbours, lock, stock and barrel, were transferred to the Department of Transport when that Department took over the great national ports from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The Labour Party opposed the break-up of the Department of the Marine in that fashion.  The Minister of State who is present and who was a former Minister for the Marine will be heartened to know the Labour Party is dedicated to bringing the Department of the Marine back together again.  Those regulations were laid before the Dáil but did not come before the Dáil, which is what Deputy Durkan has been asking for all day.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">In the case of the break-up of the marine section of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, we got a new order stating that the fishery harbours are being taken back from the Department of Transport.  Deputy Durkan's amendment in which he seeks to insert the words "such classes to be determined and approved by Dáil Éireann" is reasonable and is consistent with the issue raised by him throughout this Bill.  I support the amendment.</p>

When Members of the Minister of State's party were in opposition, they moaned and groaned on every single issue.

I resent the degree to which the Oireachtas is being by-passed on every legislation.  Heretofore, Ministers were anxious to ensure that they were covered in so far as their accountability to the House was concerned.  Now, however, a policy has been developed whereby major changes can be made, which can have a profound effect on legislation by virtue of regulations a Minister may think up in a lighter or not so light moment.  I am not suggesting that the Minister of State has lighter moments but the extent of the impact of the regulations should be borne in mind.  In particular we need to consider how the industry will be affected by the magnitude of regulations which can completely alter the import and impact of the legislation.</p>

It is quite true that the whole world has not come to a halt as a result of this but it could.  It proves a valuable point, that even Ministers can make mistakes.

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1189">In page 18, to delete lines 3 to 10 and substitute the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1190">10A.—(1)(<i>a</i>) In the interests of the proper and effective regulation of the electricity and natural gas markets and the formulation of policy applicable to such proper and effective regulation, the Minister may give such general policy directions to the Commission, as he or she considers appropriate, to be followed by the Commission in the exercise of its functions.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1191">(<i>b</i>) Notwithstanding the generality of paragraph (<i>a</i>), such general policy directions may have regard to the following issues—</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1192">(i) security of energy supply,</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1193">(ii) sustainability of energy supply,</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1194">(iii) competitiveness of energy supply, or</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1195">(iv) such other matter which the Minister considers appropriate.".</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">In the first instance, I propose to comment on amendments Nos. 49, 52 and 55.  Amendment No. 49 addresses issues raised by Deputy Broughan on Committee Stage.  It identifies certain issues such as those captured under the three separate headings on the Department's Green Paper on energy policy, to which the Minister may have regard in any general policy direction given to CER.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive list as the Minister will require the necessary flexibility to meet a variety of competing market and regulatory issues and contingencies, some of which may not be easily predicted at this stage.  The issues mentioned in the provision are sufficiently broad to meet most if not all contingencies, including the issues of energy security, sustainability, fuel poverty and pricing, as identified by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">Amendments Nos. 52 to 55, inclusive, follow on an amendment originally proposed by Deputy Eamon Ryan and from discussions which took place on Committee Stage.  It is proposed to increase the minimum number of days within which representations may be made relating to proposed policy directions from the Minister to the CER from 21 to 30 and to require the Minister to submit a copy of the proposed policy direction to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for consideration.  The changes to subsection (5) are consequential to those made to subsection (3) and simply refer to the Minister's obligations under the amended subsection.  Given that these incorporate the points raised by Deputies in the majority of their amendments, Opposition amendments Nos. 50, 51, 53 and 54 fall as a necessary consequence of approval of the amendment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">As regards Deputy Broughan's amendment No. 56, the issue of targets for renewable energy within appropriate timeframes is addressed in detail in the Green Paper on energy policy.  While the sentiment behind the Deputy's proposal is laudable, the dates proposed are unrealistic and have little grounding in solid data or evidence.  Changes in technology, new energy sources and national and international issues are constantly evolving.  The CER's gas capacity statement and EirGrid's generation adequacy reports project seven and five years into the future, respectively, which are more realistic timeframes.  Business planning to a targeted 34 or 44 years in the future can have little or no concrete footing in present realities and, while we may wish to be aspirational in our goals, we must also be realistic.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_498">
            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_1199">A key problem that regularly arises in times of crisis or major developments in the area of energy is the failure by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to set out his objectives in directives.  In that context, I welcome what the Minister of State has said in terms of outlining the key objectives which should be set out in any directive from the Minister to the CER.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">Some 20 years ago, when the former leader of the Labour Party, Dick Spring, was Minister for Energy, he set out the principles which should guide any coherent energy policy.  These principles, which included security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability, remain relevant, so it is good to see provision being made for them in the legislation governing the CER.  Therefore, I commend the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on listening to the argument I made in respect of amendment No. 51.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">Earlier I made a lengthy contribution on energy poverty and I continue to be unhappy that the Green Paper devoted only one page to the issue, even though it will profoundly affect our constituents over the coming winter.  We have to act drastically in light of what has happened in the CER and we will be depending on the fiscal response of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to alleviate the problem.  Deloitte &amp; Touche estimates that 20% of the population, or 750,000 people, suffers from energy poverty and research I have conducted for the Labour Party indicates that 250,000 people are profoundly affected and up to 500,000 deeply affected by the problem.  Many people were shocked to learn the extent of the energy problem from the professional and academic study conducted by Deloitte &amp; Touche.  I urge the Minister of State to reconsider amendment No. 51 with a view to including energy and fuel poverty among the CER's responsibilities.  Recent energy price increases have had a severe impact, despite reports from Bord Gáis Éireann and Flogas that home heating oil prices have fallen below the price of gas.  Last winter also saw significant increases in the price of home heating oil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">Amendment No. 52 represents an advance on the Bill as originally presented to the House.  The extension to the time period for consultations is welcome.  In my contribution on behalf of the Labour Party to the review of the Green Paper, I will be arguing strongly for the inclusion of fuel poverty in the final White Paper and any legislation subsequently introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">Amendment No. 54 is in line with many of the amendments that Deputy Durkan and I proposed on Committee Stage with regard to laying draft directives before the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources or any future Oireachtas committee on energy.  Full discussions on these matters would ensure that Departments could not disappear because of mistaken ministerial orders.  The way in which orders are presented as motions to the House and then sent to the library means that it is difficult for Deputies to understand exactly what is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">With regard to amendment No. 56, the Green Party's Climate Change Targets Bill 2005 was thought-provoking and useful.  The Bill proposed that we would conduct regular examinations and hold full debates on climate change.  In terms of energy, we are faced with the fundamental challenges of climate change, which no serious scientist would now dispute, and the depletion of fossil resources.  Given that we will have to adapt our economy over coming decades if we are to become sustainable, it is reasonable to set targets.  Earlier a young Irish company made representations to Deputies with regard to meeting the target set by the EU for biofuels.  A target was set for 2005 of producing 2% of liquid fuels from biofuel but, shamefully, the Government only reached 0.00004%.  That young company is trying to rectify the Government's failure to meet the target.  We all need targets.  For example, Government and Opposition parties have set targets for the number of seats they want to win in the next general election.  With regard to this fundamental issue, we will hopefully meet the 2010 EU biofuel target of 5.75%.  The Minister recently changed the target for renewable sources of electricity for 2010 from 13.4% to 15%.  He has a target of 30% for 2020.  He is already setting targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">Energy issues have very long lead times.  Very little can be achieved even in the lifetime of one government and we need to be thinking in terms of seven to ten years in planning to move generation towards renewable sources.  We should be looking towards 2030, a quarter of a century from now, or perhaps 2050 to achieve a zero emissions economy as a reasonable ambition for any country.  We should be prepared to set targets and review them regularly here.  The discussion we had on the Green Party Bill on climate change should be repeated on a regular basis in the remaining months of this Dáil and in future Dáileanna.  I urge the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 56 in the spirit in which it was tabled.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_499">
            <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_1206">I thank the Minister for accepting the proposed intent of my amendment No. 53, which I will not move, and for taking up some of the suggestions made by Deputy Broughan, in particular the proposal to refer any such direction to the Oireachtas joint committee in advance of a decision being made by the Minister, which is a welcome step in the right direction.  I hope that the committees of the Houses can grasp the increasing opportunities for us to become involved in discussion on detailed policy issues as they are evolving rather than after the fact, which is often the case in this Chamber.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">I commend and thank Deputy Broughan for the intent and purpose of his amendment No. 56, on which I concur with him.  Amendment No. 49 indicates the stars by which we navigate in energy policy.  The Green Paper is correct in highlighting the three-way algorithm, almost, between environmental considerations, security of supply and economic considerations.  Deputy Broughan correctly pointed out that some other social considerations are not covered by the word "competitiveness".  It is possible that the word "competitiveness" is too narrow in not considering the social justice issues that can come into the economic equation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">The gravity, scale and import of climate change is such that it supersedes the economic and security of supply issues.  In the film "An Inconvenient Truth", the former US Vice-President, Al Gore, accurately portrays balancing the economy on one side and the environment on the other.  A clear realisation has been reached that such is the scale and speed of change to the environment that some scientists are now predicting as a result of climate change that we cannot possibly have a healthy economy in those circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">I agree with and commend the British Government and many others in recognising this in their stated energy policies.  Everything starts and finishes with climate change targets.  Obviously, economic and security of supply considerations must be taken into account.  However, the sort of cuts that scientists estimate we must make to address the issue represent the star by which they are guiding themselves.  Even if we try to adopt a different mode and try to buy our way out of the issue or ignore it, we can be fairly certain that, within the scale of time in which energy policy applies, the international scientific community will bring us back to that scientific reality.  Therefore it makes sense for us to start now rather than wait to be forced into the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">The peak in oil production, which will undoubtedly occur within a matter of years rather than decades, requires a similar solution.  Today 60% of our energy comes from oil.  On a geological basis we know that once peak production has occurred, access to cheap oil will deplete each year by approximately 2% to 2.5% per annum.  Coincidentally that equates to the reduction we will need to make if we accept scientific advice on climate change.  We will need to make deep cuts in emissions as our part of international co-operation to address the issue.  For two reasons coming from different directions we need to follow the same policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">The fundamental stark issues ahead of us are not given sufficient consideration in the Commission for Energy Regulation or the Government and are not properly recognised in the Green Paper.  Regardless of what wording we insert into legislation, we will only start to address the issue when we show real political will and leadership.  We need to go beyond the short-term thinking of the next general election towards thinking, as Deputy Broughan outlined, what fundamental changes in energy need to be made over several governments.  While that is for another day, I commend the Minister for these changes and I commend Deputy Broughan for his amendment No. 56, which I fully support.</p>

          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_500">
            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_1212">With my colleagues, I welcome the Minister's amendment, reflecting the views expressed on Committee Stage, which again proves my point that we can all help each other out to a lesser or greater extent.  Amendment No 49 has the heading "Policy directions to Commission."  All along we have been told that the commission is independent.  The list of directions, with which I agree, is as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1213">(<i>b</i>) Notwithstanding the generality of paragraph (<i>a</i>), such general policy directions may have regard to the following issues——</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1214">(i) security of energy supply, [which is absolutely correct and essential]</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1215">(ii) sustainability of energy supply, [which is absolutely correct]</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1216">(iii) competitiveness of energy supply, or</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1217">(iv) such other matter which the Minister considers appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">I would have thought that some of the things that happened in recent weeks might also have been appropriate.  The issues raised by Deputies Broughan and Eamon Ryan and me could have been brought within that area.  This comes back to the Minister's wisdom in arriving at a conclusion as to what else should be included.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">Arising from the energy price increases of recent weeks and other proposed electricity prices to be implemented in the new year, it is the general consensus that industry cannot sustain them and that some industries will need to relocate away from the country because of the problems that will be presented to them.  In those circumstances, the Minister under the heading of policy directions to the commission, should have realised the impact those increases would have on industry, employment etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">I cannot understand why no regard was had for the economic impact of the regulator's decisions.  We have heard all about the need to observe the independence of the regulator and to recognise that the regulator is above politics.  Deputy Broughan mentioned the analogy to the Health Service Executive where somebody who is not accountable has taken over and determines policy.  This amendment represents an admission by the Minister that policy directions are within his or her remit.  Incidentally I notice the words "his or her".  When discussing a proposed amendment to another Bill yesterday, the Minister involved deemed that "his or her" was not necessary.</p>

            <from>Mr. Callanan</from>
            <p eId="para_1225">I wish to speak about services for the elderly.  It is the Department's policy to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home in accordance with their wishes and at the same provide high quality residential care for them when they can no longer be maintained in this manner.  The Government's commitment to the development of a range of services for older people can be demonstrated clearly by outlining the resources made available in recent years.  Between 1997 and 2005, inclusive, additional spending on health care services was in excess of €302 million.  Funding is provided through the carer's allowance and carer's benefit.  I welcome the changes that have been made to these payments.  The carer's allowance was extended to 24 months and the disregard pertaining thereto allows many more people to become eligible.  The respite grant is very welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_1226">The home help service, which is the cornerstone of community-based care for older people, is delivered as part of the community support service.  This service is targeted at high and medium dependency clients according to need.  An additional €33 million was allocated for this programme in the budget for 2006 and it is being used to provide 1.7 million more home help hours this year.  The HSE has reported that the programme is on target.  There has been significant demand for home help due to the increasing number of older people living in the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">Provision for home help services is critical to supporting older people at home, preventing admissions to acute services, delaying admissions, continuing care and facilitating early discharge from the acute hospital sector to the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">On community services, there has been a significant increase in the resources made available to the meals-on-wheels service.  An additional €10 million was spent on the service in 2004 and additional funding of €2.5 million was provided in 2005, together with a further €2.5 million this year.  This amounts to an increase of 50% over the figure for 2004.  The meals-on-wheels service is one of a range of services that can support older living in their own homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">I congratulate Ballinasloe Social Services on its 25th anniversary last week.  The chairman, Sr. Alacoque, and the chief executive officer, Theresa Coughlan, are doing wonderful work keeping people out of hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">Funding for nursing home subventions has been increased but we in the west have difficulty with the amount being paid there compared to the east and south.  The rate in the west is far less than half that in the east and this is causing serious difficulties for those with parents in nursing homes in the west.  I ask the Minister to review the way in which the subvention is paid and to make it fairer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">I welcome the proposals to build a new unit at St. Brendan's Geriatric Hospital in Loughrea and a new community nursing home in Ballinasloe.  The new beds will be very welcome as the waiting list for public geriatric care in County Galway is very long.  I compliment the staff of St. Brendan's on the great care they are providing to the elderly.  I welcome the new health campus for Tuam, which can be used as a step-down facility for the Galway hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">Some €55 million has been allocated for home care packages based on the 1,100 pilot care schemes in place by the end of 2005.  They are delivering a wide range of services.  It is planned that an additional 2,000 packages will be in place by the end of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">The HSE has advised that 1,800 new clients were in receipt of home care in the first six months of this year.  Home care packages are targeted at those in the community who would otherwise require admission to residential care.  The packages vary according to the care needs of the individual, which may include the services of nurses, home care attendants, home helps and various therapists, including physiotherapists and occupational therapists.  These packages are delivered through the HSE for a range of providers, including the HSE itself, voluntary groups and private sector organisations.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Connor</from>
            <p eId="para_1234">I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this very important debate.  I had intended to spend my five minutes talking about a range of national issues and support my colleague Deputy Fiona O'Malley in respect of Loughlinstown.  However, no debate on health, this week or any other week, could go ahead without some mention of Tallaght Hospital, of which I am very proud.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">I will not rehash the point I made repeatedly over recent weeks, particularly at meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, chaired by Deputy Moloney.  Suffice it to say that this is not just an issue for Tallaght but also for the Dublin region, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  We need clarity regarding what is to happen.  The decision to situate the major children's hospital on the site of the Mater has been made.  I live within the shadow of Tallaght Hospital and have been involved in the project since 1988 when I was first appointed to the board by the then Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon.  He made a good choice.</p>

          <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_508">
            <from>Mr. O’Connor</from>
            <p eId="para_1237">He was a very far-sighted Minister for Health.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">In 1998, I was involved with the board that opened the hospital.  We were very clear that the National Children's Hospital would be an integral part of the Tallaght Hospital operation.  We now need to know how to proceed.  What will be the future of children's services in Tallaght Hospital?  The bottom line for my community, with whom I have marched, is that children's services must be retained at the hospital.  As Archbishop Eames told the Taoiseach, they must also be developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">I will not repeat the points I made at the meetings of the joint committee but it is very important that I make clear my strong views and express my support for Tallaght Hospital.  Even if I were not living in or representing Tallaght, I would still take the view that the hospital should be the chosen site for the National Children's Hospital.  It meets all the criteria and the HSE decision has confused many people.  It was a flawed decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">Let me make a few other points on the future of Tallaght Hospital.  As one will know, it was formed in 1998 through the charter by amalgamating the Adelaide and Meath hospitals and the National Children's Hospital.  Its catchment area includes Tallaght, which is the third largest population centre in the country, and also stretches through north Kildare and Wicklow.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">I have a number of worries regarding the development of services at Tallaght Hospital.  It is important that cancer services remain in the hospital when the proposed cancer services review is completed next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">There has been much talk in recent times about accident and emergency services, and Tallaght Hospital has had its difficulties in this regard.  As one who lives in and represents Tallaght, I believe the new 39-bed transition unit, which was opened recently, is being used mainly by patients from the accident and emergency department whose length of stay is anticipated to be less than five days.  I am glad that, since the opening of the unit, the number of patients waiting over night in the accident and emergency department has dropped significantly.  We should all welcome this move.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">The Minister for Health and Children stated last night that an extra 100 beds will be made available for public patients in Tallaght Hospital arising from the initiative she announced.  This is positive news.  However, I am unhappy about and agitated over the children's services issue, which needs to be clarified.  I want the HSE to outline to the community in Tallaght and elsewhere the future of the services and state how they are to be developed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1244">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion on the health service, which has been proposed by the Labour Party.</p>

            <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>

          <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_511">
            <from>Dr. Devins</from>
            <p eId="para_1246">As the Minister for Health and Children stated last night, this motion is not just black and white — it is all black, unfortunately.  That is no surprise because members of the Labour Party frequently speak about this country's health service in a negative fashion.  I often wonder whether they are living in the real world.  There are problems in the health service, but they are being dealt with.  Over the past 12 months, an increasing number of people who have used the health service have told me how satisfied they are with it.  I am sure the other Deputies in the House have had the same experience.  One of the most poignant episodes I encountered recently was when I met an elderly lady who had been having treatment for cancer in Sligo General Hospital over a period of time.  Her life had not been easy, especially during the recent past, as she had been in constant pain for some time.  When I met her some weeks ago, she praised the treatment she received and the courtesy that was extended to her by the staff of the hospital.  I have noticed this trend to an increasing extent over recent months.  In most cases, people who have had contact with the health service, at primary level or in a hospital setting, have told me they were more satisfied with the service than they were in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">There are problems in the health care system, as I have said, and they must be addressed.  One of the problems I have encountered is the length of time patients have to wait to be called to outpatient clinics.  Such problems occur in just a few specialties, because matters have improved recently.  We have all noticed the great effect the National Treatment Purchase Fund has had on the length of time patients have to wait for operations.  The dramatic reduction in waiting times can be attributed in no small measure to the work of the fund.  I wonder whether a similar scheme might be considered for patients who have been on outpatient waiting lists for a long time.  Most hospitals operate emergency waiting lists for medical or surgical emergencies.  The stress and pain encountered by people whose cases are not considered emergencies, but who have to wait a long time to be called for a first consultation, can be very debilitating in many instances.  I would welcome an innovative approach that would help to shorten such waiting lists, perhaps like that adopted in the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">In the remaining time available to me, I would like to speak about the overall work of the Health Service Executive.  Along with many of my colleagues from the west, I attended a briefing by the western section of the HSE in Leinster House this morning.  Two Deputies left the meeting early, unfortunately.  I do not know whether they left because they had other things to do — perhaps their departure could be considered as a walk-out.  I said at that meeting, as I have said in this Chamber on previous occasions, that I have an excellent relationship with the people who work for the HSE in Sligo and Manorhamilton.  If I have a problem or a query, it is attended to in a speedy and courteous fashion.  I might not always like the answers I am given, but I cannot deny that the staff of the HSE are available and responsive.  It seems there are difficulties in the communication between the various local offices and the central governing body of the HSE.  I accept that such matters have improved, but it was not before time.  I ask the Minister for Health and Children to use her offices to facilitate further improvements in this regard.  The HSE was established to offer the best possible service to the users of the health system — patients and their families.  Any logjam or lack of communication between local services and national issues must be avoided.  I commend the Minister's amendment to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_1251">I suggest that the Opposition is completely enslaved by its ideology.  The initiative of the Minister for Health and Children in increasing the number of public beds in this country has been completely misinterpreted.  I prefer to call it a "reclamation project" because it involves the reclamation of 1,000 public beds, exclusively for the public health service, and needs to be recognised as such.  Those who use some warped form of logic like to refer to it as privatisation, however, which does not make any sense.  Some 1,000 beds, which are currently subsidised and designated for exclusive use by the private sector, are to be returned to the exclusive use of the public health system.  That is what this initiative is actually all about.  Those who interpret this policy in any other way are doing it a disservice.  They are scaring the public by suggesting that the number of available beds is decreasing.</p>

That is an example of ideology getting in the way of the perception of service delivery.  The Minister's National Treatment Purchase Fund initiative has proven that services can be bought privately in certain circumstances.  Why not buy them in such circumstances?

            <p eId="para_1309">I thank Deputy McGrath for his support.  This is where the bulk of essential surgical, medical and emergency expertise is based, with a tradition going back centuries.  The Rotunda Hospital was founded over 250 years ago.  I was a member of that hospital's board for some years and was delighted and honoured to serve there.  The ethos at the Rotunda Hospital is nearer that of Tallaght hospital than the Mater hospital, Beaumont Hospital, Blanchardstown hospital or Temple Street children's hospital.  Yet a recent statement indicates they wish to move their facilities to a Mater hospital campus.  A body of expertise and experience is being assembled on the north side of Dublin city with a dedication to the treatment of people unrivalled in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">I conducted some research recently and found that over 70% of those arriving at hospitals, including the seriously injured, came on foot or by public transport.  We will build a metro station under the Mater hospital so talk of access to the new tertiary hospital facility is facetious to say the least.  The tertiary hospital discussion has been muddied by people with vested interests, not all of which are in the best interests of the patients they purport to look after.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">Deputy Finian McGrath will be interested to hear that neurosurgery facilities for children under five years of age will move to Temple Street children's hospital.  This is not because neurosurgical facilities there are better than at Beaumont Hospital, but because over the years a body of expertise, knowledge and experience in anaesthesia dealing with seriously ill children has been built up.</p>

Rather than failed policies, a combination of excellent policies have come from the Minister and previous Fianna Fáil Ministers in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">This issue is a reflection on the success of the economy whereby we invite the private sector to become involved in resolving the health service difficulties that have arisen over the years.  Through this investment throughout the State we will see more public beds available and, more importantly, better use of health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318">Take, for example, the proposed policy of locating private hospitals on public land.  This is something I entirely support and cannot understand why Deputies perceive difficulties with it.  In my constituency there is a large land bank beside Portlaoise hospital and I hope to see a private hospital on that ground.  I recognise the combination of technical and medical expertise, with other services, that can be used in the private and public sectors to resolve the issue of waiting lists and present greater bed capacity.  I wonder why Deputies are opposed to this idea.  I even began to wonder if Deputies feared we might resolve the health difficulties too quickly.</p>

Where I come from the involvement of the private sector has produced excellent dividends and has reduced waiting lists.  I can see the same happening with this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">Public hospitals and consultants are paid more for private patients in public-funded hospitals through the taxpayer and I believe this is an opportunity to provide extra beds in the system.  I wonder how the change of heart came about because previously we were very used to the involvement of the private sector in public health.  Take the designation of private and semi-private beds in public hospitals, which is something we have been aware of for years.  We had no problem with income tax relief on private health insurance premiums.  The same goes for income tax relief on medical and dental expenses and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">I do not see the proposed initiative as one party in government advancing its ideology.  I see it as a building block that will help solve the accident and emergency crisis, bed capacity issues and so on.  This is something that should not divide the House; we should welcome it.  Local authorities often have difficulty rezoning land banks around hospitals, though the argument is frequently made that rezoning for residential purposes will create funding for hospitals which can cause annoyance in local communities.  This initiative could resolve such issues.  Land that heretofore belonged to a hospital campus can now be properly used by the Department of Health and Children.  This will solve health issues and make better use of health funding.  I fully support the Minister for Health and Children's proposal and believe it is one of many Government initiatives to address the health issue.  I wish this Administration had more time left to bring all these elements together and resolve the difficulties facing the health service.</p>

            <p eId="para_1329">People in the Opposition may say they would like that job but it is, without doubt, difficult because there are many competing interests.  We now have the medical means and technology to keep people alive far longer than previously, and the longer they live the more treatment they will require in the course of a lifetime.  This consumes more money.  This is why we currently find ourselves in difficulty, but we are not alone.  Many countries throughout the European Union and elsewhere have difficulties in their health services.  For example, the oft-lauded French system will, by all accounts, be broke within 15 years.  That is the stark reality many countries must face.</p>

            <p eId="para_1345">If the Deputy really believed in equality, and in the lot of the public patient, why will she not advocate a common waiting list?  Would that not make sense?  Those who have money get treated first and those that do not have money are left until last.  This is the reality.  The Deputy's party would not introduce such a waiting list.  The Deputy asked what the Green Party is about.  We really believe in equality.  Nobody has the guts to stand up and call for a common waiting list.  This is where the real inequality lies in our system and it is totally and utterly unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1346">Many of our accident and emergency units are clogged up at the weekend with people who have consumed too much alcohol.  Many illnesses we observe in our hospitals are related to alcohol consumption.  In terms of absenteeism and anti-social behaviour, the consequences of alcohol consumption are costing us billions of euro every year.  The Minister of Health and Children and the Government have not faced up to that reality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1347">The alcohol products Bill was promised by Deputy Martin when he was Minister for Health and Children.  It was on the programme of promised legislation but was removed at the behest of the alcohol industry.  That was both irresponsible and wrong.  Facing up to the realities of alcohol consumption is something that most Deputies here would advocate.  Warnings should be put on alcohol bottles.  The revival of this Bill is something about which Deputy O'Malley should speak to her party colleague, the Minister.</p>

            <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_1348">On behalf of Sinn Féin, I support the motion in the name of the Labour Members.  The privatisation of our hospital services by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government is something we in Sinn Féin have been campaigning strongly against for months.  On Saturday last, we organised a major rally in Dublin demanding health care rights for all.  One of the main themes was our opposition to the Minister of Health and Children, Deputy Harney's outrageous plan to allocate land at public hospital sites, as well as massive tax breaks, to the developers of private for-profit hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1349">On 9 August, we held protests at most of the ten sites nominated for this co-location plan.  Today, a new private hospital, subsidised by the Government with tax breaks, was opened in Sandyford in Dublin.  This is run by Beacon, part of the Beacon-Triad group with a massive parent health care company in the United States.  It is reported that the parent company has had to pay $1.7 billion to the US Justice Department arising out of civil and criminal cases against it.  These same privateers are among the bidders to develop private hospitals on six of the Minister's ten sites.  All the Minister and the Taoiseach can do when they are asked about this in the Dáil is parrot the company's denial.  However, the facts are there and I believe they will come back to haunt the Government.  More importantly, if they persist with this plan, the privateers will further damage our ailing health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">Today, on the same day as this new Beacon Hospital opened, we learned that planning permission has been granted for a luxury new private hospital in the grounds of Adare Manor in County Limerick.  We are told it will be set in rolling parkland with 100 private rooms, each with a flat screen television and Internet access.  It will have six operating theatres, two radiology suites and 30 consultant suites.  An Irish-American businessman and BMI Healthcare, a leading private hospital company in Britain, will operate it.  These developers have also submitted bids for the co-located private hospital in the grounds of Limerick Regional Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1351">Are members of the Fianna Fáil Party happy that the two-tier system of hospital care in this State is now being reinforced by their Progressive Democrats Minister for Health and Children?  The Fianna Fáil election manifesto, on which they sought their mandate in 2002, pledged to end the two-tier system.  Are they happy with circumstances where older people who have worked all their lives and are in poor circumstances in their twilight years must endure the indignities and dangers of our public hospital accident and emergency units and wards while the privileged few can book into luxury hospitals with televisions and computers in every room?  Is that the legacy of a party that calls itself republican?</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">The Labour Party motion is worthy of support and I commend it on tabling it.  I now turn to their colleagues in the proposed rainbow alternative.  I find it curious that the Fine Gael Deputies did not co-sign the motion as has been the practice lately.  Today, on the "News at One" on RTE radio, I understand Fine Gael's health spokesperson, Deputy Twomey, for whom I have great respect, avoided the question of whether he, in Government, would stop or reverse the Minister, Deputy Harney's private hospital co-location scheme.  He was not specific and precise in his reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_1354">If that is the case, belated though it is, it must be welcomed.  He was careful in his speech last night to repeatedly express his support for private medicine.  He should listen more carefully to Dr. John Barton of Portiuncula Hospital, one of the strongest critics of privatisation in our health services and, I understand, a would-be party colleague of Deputy Twomey here after the next general election.</p>
            <p eId="para_1355">I welcome what Deputy Twomey said about ending private hospital co-location schemes.  He is obviously supporting the motion.  I urge him to oppose the use of tax incentives to promote, as the motion states, the development of private super-clinics. I have not seen that in Fine Gael policy so far, but I welcome the party's support for the Labour Party motion which includes that reference.  However, another Fine Gael Deputy has welcomed the luxury Adare hospital which is subsidised by tax incentives.  We need clarity.  What is Fine Gael policy and what will be the policy of a Fine Gael-Labour-led administration if one is ever formed?  We need to know if they will end tax breaks for private hospitals.  That must be spelt out because the public deserve to know.</p>
            <p eId="para_1356">A world class health service cannot be provided while the public purse subsidises both public and private health care.  The private system will always win and under this Minister that is absolutely the case.  The system will be world class but only for the privileged few while the rest of us will have to struggle with second class service.  That is unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">Sinn Féin unashamedly supports a universal, publicly provided health service with access for all based on need alone.  That is the critical position and I hope it is the Labour Party position and that, in time, good sense will come to Fianna Fáil.</p>

            <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_1358">I welcome and support this Private Members' motion.  I want to focus on the privatisation of care and the need for health to be treated as a community service.  Not only are we moving toward more private hospitals, clinics and nursing homes, we are moving towards a franchise approach to the delivery of home care.  We built a home help system through the health boards over many years.  It stemmed from volunteerism and was subsequently recognised by a small payment, although the work that was done was never fully rewarded.  Often the home help did significantly more hours than he or she was paid for.  Instead of building on that system, however, we are moving towards the introduction of a franchise approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">The website of the Comfort Keepers franchise has a banner that reads "In-home care for seniors and loved ones".  It continues:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1360">People are living longer.  Society is becoming more mobile as children are living farther away from their parents.  Two income families are becoming the norm so nursing homes and assisted living centres are bursting at the seams.  While at the same time, an incredible number of elderly people are looking for any means available to avoid going into those nursing homes and retirement centres.  They want to remain in their homes.  This provides an untapped market for owners of a Comfort Keepers franchise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1361">The services the company offers include meal preparation, transport to doctors' appointments, light housekeeping and, in some cases, personal care such as bathing, dressing and mobility.  A franchise with the company costs around €26,000 plus establishment costs.  The company operates in America, Canada, Britain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.  In highlighting this I am questioning the philosophy that drives such decisions.  We are truly becoming the 53rd state.  While there is much to be admired about America, its health service is not something to emulate.</p>

            <from>Mr. Healy</from>
            <p eId="para_1362">I support the Labour Party motion.  In addressing the motion, I say shame on the Taoiseach, who last week had the audacity to blame health service workers for the mess his Government and Ministers have made of the health service in this country.  I can tell the Taoiseach that health service workers, with whom I have worked for 21 years in the acute services, work above and beyond the call of duty.  The Taoiseach and Government should place the blame where it lies — on the shoulders of the Taoiseach, the Government and the procession of Ministers for Health and Children over the last ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">This motion calls for the Irish people to be entitled to a health service that delivers excellence, quality and efficiency and that financial means must not be a barrier to receiving the highest quality of care.  A number of areas where there is a shameful lack of attention must be addressed.  The BreastCheck programme has not been fully rolled out, particularly in the south.  In south Tipperary there is a long waiting list for services such as orthodontics.  The standards in the service are totally out of date and huge numbers of children cannot avail of it.  Their parents are forced to pay thousands of euros for their children.  I regularly come across elderly people looking for hearing aids; the waiting list for a 78 year old man for a hearing aid is 15 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_1364">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and I support it.  People referred to change for the better earlier.  The people of Monaghan have not seen change for the better, as 10,000 residents who recently took to the streets would attest.  While this debate is about public and private hospitals, we in Monaghan are not in a position to reject either type.  I would accept either and would help to identify a site for one.</p>
            <p eId="para_1365">The recent Teamwork report on hospital services in the north east is supposed to be a national blueprint but the report fails in a number of areas.  There was no consultation with consultants, staff or GPs, those at the coalface.  They were left out of the loop but these are the people who are expected to deliver these services.  It was a case of Teamwork knows best.</p>
            <p eId="para_1366">We were told by Professor Drumm that Teamwork ignored all previous reports.  That was careless, to put it mildly, or perhaps the group simply dusted down a version of the failed British model.  It is incredible that Teamwork also ignored CAWT, the cross-Border health body.  We are supposed to accept this as the best way forward but I find that difficult.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">We are also supposed to accept the closure of intensive care units in each of the four hospitals in the north east and their move to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  Is that the best way forward, to send people to a hospital that regularly has 10% to 15% of the national trolley count and appeals to people not to attend because it is full to the gills?  Professor Drumm has said that the people of Monaghan are scaremongering, even though 17 people died when the hospital was taken off call.  Thankfully it is back on medical call, although I would like to see it on surgical call.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">Tonight's debate is about public and private hospitals.  Before any decision is made, I call on the Government to consider the system operated by InterHealth Canada, a private company that builds hospitals for the public health system.  There are models in Canada, the UAE and the Turks and Caicos Islands.  The company opened an NHS hospital in Cheshire on 5 October.</p>

            <p eId="para_1374">Now the Government is in pre-election mode and the budget is almost upon us, I presume we can expect to see grandiose public announcements of promises and proposed projects aimed at curing all the ills in our health service.  The reality, unfortunately, is very different.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">Successive Ministers for Health and Children in this Government have failed to provide a quality care service for the Irish people.  My constituency of Clare provides as bleak a picture as can be found anywhere.  This week a Fianna Fáil Senator announced that a CT scanner would soon be installed in Ennis General Hospital.  In June I asked the Minister when we could expect to see this machine.  Despite the usual promise of an early response from the HSE, no reply ever materialised.  The non-reply has become a frequent feature of the HSE.  If the scanner is to arrive, I will welcome it but in early September the same Senator promised that architect's plans for Ennis General Hospital would be lodged with Clare County Council within two weeks but no such plans have been lodged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">In Clare, under this Government, there are plans to downgrade Ennis General Hospital's accident and emergency department, leaving the whole of the county dependent on Limerick for doctor-led accident and emergency services.  In east Clare there is no 24 hour cover.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">Any child seeking orthodontic services faces a trip to Limerick, necessitating extra time off work for a parent who wishes to gain access to this service.  There is little hope of treatment due to the shambolic approach of the HSE in recruiting orthodontists.  But for the goodwill, commitment and efficiency of Dr. Ted McNamara, young people in the area would have no orthodontic service at all.</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">Anyone requiring orthopaedic surgery faces a similar fate, having to travel to Tuam, even further away, for assessment.  There is then a long wait before treatment.  This week I was informed by the hospital in Tuam that the consultant dealing with cases from County Clare has retired and has not been replaced.  Consequently, public patients from Clare are now an even lower priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">There are no maternity services in Clare and the maternity hospital in Limerick has a fine new extension but no staff to run it.  It is time the Government took strong action.  Proper community based support centres and teams should be established in strategic geographical locations to limit the time lost before emergency assessment and initial treatment are provided.  It is time to change the training culture for surgeons and consultants.  Shift work must be made part of their working conditions in order that theatres can be used seven days per week, including nights and weekends, to eliminate shameful waiting lists.</p>

            <p eId="para_1382">I welcome the motion and congratulate the Labour Party spokesperson on health, Deputy McManus, on tabling it.  What difference will the Government's strategy on health make to constituents who seek assistance in having care provided for their loved ones?  It will not make an iota of a difference to senior citizens because they will continue to attend accident and emergency departments seeking treatment, notwithstanding statements by Ministers that such people should be fined.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">The Health Service Executive and Minister for Health and Children have done nothing to facilitate home care for senior citizens.  At a meeting on the HSE held in Leinster House 2000 earlier today, I was astonished to hear Fianna Fáil Party Deputies describe the home care package as a disaster.  They could not understand how it worked and did not know how to seek information about it.  Opposition spokespersons noted that people will have to incur debt to cover the cost of home care packages because the HSE has not yet got its act together to make home care payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">Similar problems arise with regard to disabled person's grant and essential repairs grant.  If people had appropriate facilities, they would be able to stay in their home and would not attend accident and emergency units and hospitals, and would not regularly contribute to overcrowding in our hospitals.  The HSE is involved in two aspects of the disabled person's grant.  First, it has a role in the assessments carried out by occupational therapists.  It may also provide a top-up grant once a local authority approves a grant.  This would be good if it worked but the HSE will refuse to award a top-up grant to assist an applicant seeking to have facilities installed to improve his or her quality of life at home because it waits until a local authority signs off on the initial loan.  As a result, if the facility sought by the applicant is deemed to be above the threshold specified in the 2000 regulations, the applicant must try to raise a loan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">Senior citizens are not in a position to secure a loan of €8,000 or €9,000 but when they apply to the HSE for a top-up loan they are informed the application will not be considered until the disabled person's grant has been signed off by the local authority.  This means the disabled person's grant cannot be drawn down by the applicant because no builder will take on a job if its costs are not fully covered by the grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">The same problems arise with the essential repairs grant.  Senior citizens who wish to stay at home are unable to obtain grants which would enable them to do so.  In addition, no new claims for home help services are being accepted because of an unresolved industrial dispute.  The poor legislation on nursing home subventions before the House will not address problems in this area but will create further problems for senior citizens who wish to remain at home.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">At the same time, prime lands in public hospital grounds are being sold.  In my area, independent living units for senior citizens have been provided.  Instead of building private hospitals, would it not be preferable if the HSE made land available to provide independent living accommodation for senior citizens?  This would give them security and comfort in the knowledge that help was close at hand.  There is no logic in the argument made by the Government side.  Unless we clean up our act as regards providing care and supports to senior citizens, the crisis in accident and emergency departments will persist.</p>

            <p eId="para_1388">I thank my colleague, Deputy McManus, for raising this important issue.  One of the features that mark out a society is how it treats its poorest members and those in greatest need, particularly in areas such as health.  The Government's approach has been characterised by a form of schizophrenia.  Fianna Fáil appears to want to take a populist approach in which it emphasises health services for everybody whereas the ideology of the Progressive Democrats requires that public services be privatised, even if they function well.  The mechanism by which the latter party has chosen to do this is to provide extraordinarily generous tax breaks for people who invest in the health care industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">The issue is no longer one of health care but one of investment opportunities, property development and the health care industry.  Labour Party members are not foolish.  While we are aware that in today's economy and in the era of globalisation the health care industry has become global, the issue here is to decide what is best for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">Last night, the Minister referred to Dean Swift founding a hospital at St. Patrick's Cathedral as a private initiative several hundred years ago.  The truth is that well-off or religiously inclined people provided for the common and public good at that time.  Dean Swift did not take a punt on an investment worth €100 million in the grounds of Blanchardstown hospital.  He was motivated by a concern to provide for the poor and indigent in Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_1392">The Minister of State probably shares my concerns.  The Minister alluded to Dean Swift's involvement in establishing a hospital.  It was a private hospital under a charitable structure which reflected the fact that he was a Protestant clergyman.  Like the Rotunda Hospital, a number of voluntary hospitals and the religious hospitals founded from the 19th century onwards by various Catholic religious orders, the hospital established by Dean Swift was a private institution formed for the public good.  It is important to clarify that point.</p>
            <p eId="para_1393">The tax breaks for investors will benefit prominent individuals such as Mr. Goodman who has considerable expertise as a trader in cattle and beef on international markets.  Mr. Goodman has amassed a large fortune and is a great businessman.  Hospital care requires an ethical framework and its purpose must be to provide the highest possible standard of long-term public care for the maximum number of people.  The tax breaks apply to buildings; they do not relate to care but to investment in the built structure.  The buildings must be retained for up to 15 years.  After a long debate with the Minister for Finance, he extended to 15 years the period that the institution, old person's home, sports injury clinic or hospital must stay as a caring institution.  All the international evidence, including the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> and the studies carried out in the United States, show that the quality and outcomes of care in an institution, whether publicly or privately owned, which has a basic framework of providing for the public good, are of a far higher order than in an institution or hospital which has been developed simply and solely to take advantage of tax breaks for buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">Blanchardstown Hospital has had a great tradition of care since it was founded in the 1950s.  Given the extraordinary population of the area it is amazing that the hospital has no dedicated tertiary facilities for children.  Blanchardstown has a huge and growing population which requires services such as visiting consultants and so forth.  This could be done through public provision and not only through a private hospital.</p>

            <p eId="para_1395">I wish to discuss the Health Act 2004.  This was passed by the Dáil to provide for the construction of private health care facilities, including hospitals and nursing homes, on the grounds of public hospitals.  Fianna Fáil Ministers and Deputies are implementing this legislation in the interests of the wealthy.  This is being said by the public.  The public is also saying the Fianna Fáil Party is being easily led on this question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">It is proposed to build a private hospital on the grounds of Cork University Hospital.  Contrast this with Mallow, where a day procedure unit was promised in 2002 and has not yet been provided.  Moreover, Mallow General Hospital serves a population of 90,000 to 100,000, with rapid growth in the area.  In some instances people must wait up to two years for public services but consultants will tell patients that if they were private patients they would be treated within one or two weeks.  That is not an exaggeration but a statement of fact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1397">Despite this, however, I am informed by the Health Service Executive that plans are underway to review the provision of acute general hospital services in the southern region, which includes Mallow.  I have made repeated requests for the terms of reference of that review but to no avail.  Perhaps the Minister of State will let me have those terms of reference.  I am also informed that the committee undertaking the review will be chaired by a professor who is already the subject of an investigation by the Higher Education Authority relating to Cork University Hospital.  The Minister should think about how that person will emerge from the investigation being undertaken by the HEA.  It could be a serious matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">More people are being forced into private nursing homes because of the lack of community beds yet the Government and the HSE have made no effort to standardise the subvention provided across the country.</p>

            <from>Ms Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_1399">I have listened to the debate since last night and clearly Deputy McManus has her finger on the pulse.  The reaction to the debate has been significant.  The reaction from the Government is even more significant.  It is like rearranging deck chairs on the <i>Titanic</i>.  As happened with regard to the child care issue during the last by-election, the Government did not know there was a problem until it met the people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">I will speak about the constituency of Cork city which I and the Labour Party represent.  Hopefully, we will have increased representation after the next election.  There are many problems with the health service in Cork city but I will deal with three.  I received a letter recently from a consultant to whom I had written about an elderly gentleman who needed a hip replacement.  I will not mention further details.  The letter states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1401">It is with great regret that I have to say that the number of Orthopaedic Surgeons and staff at this hospital is the same as it was when I was an SHO.  There are no immediate plans for any increase in surgeons or operating space to deal with the unacceptable waiting times.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1402">The only plan articulated in the last few months was a referral of 300 (out of 3,000) on a waiting list to the NTPF.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1403">I think that any specialist grouping that has looked at the situation in Cork would recommend a ratio of 1 per 30,000 which would lead to a total number of 15 Orthopaedic Surgeons to deal with Cork patients.  As long ago as 1994 Comhairle recommended the immediate appointment of 2 surgeons to bring the complement to 8.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1404">Regrettably I can see no immediate end in sight, however I think that representation should be made to the HSE that a ratio of 1 surgeon per 100,000 is unacceptable in this day and age and that the immediate appointment of additional surgeons and theatre space to operate on them is immediately required to deal with this problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">There is a waiting list of four years to get an appointment to see the surgeon.  That is the situation for people who cannot pay and who are in chronic and severe pain.  If the Government Deputies continue to tell us that we have an excellent health service, they should read that letter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">Cork also emerges poorly in reports with regard to type 1 diabetes.  Approximately 200 children are being treated for the condition in CUH.  Until recently, there was a part-time nurse, part-time consultant, part-time dietician and part-time psychological service.  There are now two nurses, one of whom is being paid for by the private sector.  Although this is a great advance that is gratefully accepted by the parents involved, is this the road we should take?  Not only will there be private hospitals, but medical staff will be put into our hospitals by private companies.  Their only job will be to monitor how their particular drug is doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">It is outrageous that parents with children as young as 18 months who are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes are being sent home with a syringe and an orange and told to practise with them.  That is not good enough.  The outcome for children in the Cork area is not good and is worse than the outcome for children in the Dublin area.  However, this Minister for Health and Children does not believe that anybody outside the Pale deserves a health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">Cork city was promised a new blood transfusion service building to serve the south.  It must be ten years ago or longer since that promise was made.  Since then there have been two international reports on the issue and a fiasco in the blood transfusion service.  Only for the good work of a doctor in Cork that problem would not have been recognised.  The nurses in the blood transfusion service in Cork are still operating out of a building where buckets are used to catch the rain leaking through the roof.  It appears that because the service in Cork discovered the reason for the infection of blood products and the transmission of hepatitis C to mothers, it is being crucified and there is no end in sight.  When will we get what was recommended by two international panels and what the remainder of the country is demanding to ensure that the supply of blood in this country is safe?  Is the Minister of State going to inform us that everything is rosy in the garden?</p>

            <p eId="para_1414">In practical terms, this means that both parties are quite happy with a system where 45% of elective operations in the public hospital, Tallaght, in Deputy Rabbitte's constituency are private.  The Government wants a better deal for public patients.  We will free up new beds for public patients at ten public hospitals and we will purchase services for public patients to continue to reduce waiting times for operations, dialysis and MRI scans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">Deputy Twomey claimed that the co-location initiative will cost €2 billion.  He maintains that €1 billion in insurance premiums will be transferred to the private sector.  If €1 billion is being paid by insurers to public hospitals, that is news to everyone, including me, the hospitals, the Oireachtas, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the boards of the VHI and BUPA.</p>

            <p eId="para_1417">The €1 billion paid out by insurance companies is the total of all their payments in respect of tests, bed charges in private hospitals, fees for consultants and outpatient fees.  Bed charges in respect of all 2,500 private beds in public hospitals is only one aspect.  If Deputy Twomey had read the documentation produced last year in respect of this initiative, he would have seen that the income foregone for the 1,000 beds is calculated at approximately €145 million.  The Government stated that this income would be offset by lease payments to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1418">The €2 billion to which Deputy Twomey refers includes what he assumes will be a free transfer of State land.  There will be no such transfer.  The land will be leased and will earn income for the State.  Currently, there is a zero return on that land to the State or to the health system.  The flow of money is, therefore, wrong.  Many Members previously served on health boards and beheld their vast land banks.  It is time we took action and made that land pay a return to the Exchequer and the health service.</p>

            <p eId="para_1422">In respect of the cost of capital allowances, we have stated from the outset that we can achieve 1,000 new public beds for a tax cost of approximately €420 million, less than half the full cost.  This estimate is conservative and does not take account — in favour of the Government argument — of the VAT and income tax that will accrue to the Exchequer during construction.  This rationale is frequently used for film relief, which has attracted strong support on all sides of the House. There is, therefore, no €2 billion.  Deputy Twomey's calculations are wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">The Minister published the policy direction and supporting documentation relating to this area last year.  The latter include details of the investment appraisal framework suggested by Prospectus Consultants for the HSE.  I assure the House that, in respect of each co-location proposal, a rigorous value-for-money assessment will be carried out by the HSE to demonstrate the net benefit to the State.  The Minister has required this of the HSE from the start and no project can proceed without the value to the State being demonstrated first.  The National Development Finance Agency is assisting the Department of Health and Children to ensure that the financial assessment method being applied by the HSE is robust.</p>

            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_1436">It is intended as such.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">The Minister of State does not believe a word of what he just said.  He must recognise that Deputy McManus has identified an attempt to engineer a major shift in our health care system towards a for profit model.  That is the net issue.  The Minister for Health and Children, frustrated at her failures, is attempting to shift the balance of the existing system towards a for-profit model and the Minister of State is well aware that this will be expensive, inefficient and unfair, and will not be in the interests of either taxpayers or patients.  That is the scale of the issue with which we are faced.  The Minister of State is aware of the public-private mix in our system and knows the history behind the existence of such a mix.  He is also aware that the motion is not complaining about the traditional public-private mix, rather it is complaining about the fundamental attempted shift in the provision of health care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">What is happening will undoubtedly exacerbate the problems relating to the two-tier health service that is in place.  There is little point in the Minister of State pretending to misunderstand the motion.  There is also little point in him pretending that he has not heard, on the doorsteps in his constituency, people's tales of woe, not only regarding their overall concern regarding the crisis in accident and emergency services, trolley queues etc., but also in respect of the fundamental unfairness of offers being made to constituents, taxpayers or citizens with access to the private system to have their treatment fast-tracked while those in the public system must wait indefinitely.  In supporting the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister of State will exacerbate that two-tier system and I suspect that he knows that is the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">The Minister received a fair wind from this side of the House.  The scale of distress about the quality of our health service administration meant that people hoped she would be successful in addressing some of the bottlenecks, dealing with the crisis in accident and emergency departments and, in particular, dealing with the problem of queues of people on trolleys.  She has failed and she is now striking out in an ideological way to sell off scarce public land for the construction of private hospitals. Entrepreneurs — some of them in the medical profession — will get a massive tax break for building private facilities on scarce public land, the effect of which will be to exacerbate the two-tier health service that currently exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">Her frustration is understandable.  She featured in my local newspaper this week, boasting about the success in tackling the accident and emergency issue in Tallaght Hospital.  What actually happened was that the local management of the hospital made provision for 40 extra beds to treat accident and emergency cases in the teeth of opposition from the Department and the Minister.  The Minister is now claiming this as one of the jewels in her sparse crown of achievement.  I suspect that the Minister of State knows that this quick fix solution will not work.  It is the wrong solution.  It is not feasible to implement and it will exacerbate the two-tier health service.  It will be costly for the taxpayer and will contribute to the running down of the public health service.  In any event, it will not work because under the legislation that exists in this country, every citizen is entitled to a hospital bed.  Private patients will continue to come through the accident and emergency system into public beds.  The consultants will not evacuate them as their contract entitles them to practice in public hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">The Minister of State said that 45% of elective operations in Tallaght Hospital were private.  That is higher than I thought, but is not surprising when one thinks about it as the consultants are incentivised to do precisely that.  The Government is now set to incentivise them even more.  Does the Minister of State think that consultants will evacuate public beds in order to transfer the patients across the corridor to the new shiny hospital?  It will not happen.  What will happen will be that staff will migrate to the private service and the public health service will be required to pick up the slack.  The private sector will cherry pick the straightforward procedures and the complex medical procedures and older people with multiple problems will be left to the public health service.  We have scarce public land and we need that land for the construction of step-down care and community care, which is part of the solution to the accident and emergency problem.  We badly need the provision of more beds in acute hospitals.  The money should be going on these projects and not on incentivising the private sector with massive tax breaks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">I cannot but be impressed with the consultants that I meet around the country.  However, the common contract negotiations are dragging on interminably and unconscionably long.  The existing contract looks like they wrote it themselves and maybe they did.  It must be addressed.  There is no sign that this Minister has the skill or the patience to do it.  Her predecessor did not even try.  The general question of fees in the medical profession is another problem.  This morning, the Taoiseach admitted that the promise of providing 200,000 medical cards had been broken.  The Government created the doctor-only medical card, but only 12,000 have been taken up.  It has not been made known to people that they exist.  Meanwhile, people go along to their GP and pay ever-increasing prices.  The cost of seeing a GP has risen by 97% since 1997.  Some GPs have mainly a medical card client base, but others have the opposite.  Some GPs treat people for nothing while others do the opposite.  We all know of parents who are afraid to visit the GP because they cannot afford another fee.  Until some order is imposed, there is no reason not to resort to a maximum prices order, like for many other professional fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">Instead of addressing any of these issues that go to the heart of why we have ongoing problems in the health service, the Government is determined to exacerbate the two-tier health service, to dispose of valuable, scarce public land to the private sector, and to engage in the sophistry that we will continue to own the hospitals.  We will do nothing of the kind.  If the private owners decide to go to the Middle East and advertise for patients at an economic rent, there is nothing the Government can do about it.  If they decide to turn the hospital into a supermarket, there is nothing the Government can do about it.  Once a scarce public asset is disposed, then that is it.  Further division will be created, staff will be induced to enter the private sector and the public sector will be left with the difficult areas.  That is why this debate is critical.  The people have not yet woken up to the fact that the Minister for Health and Children is trying to engineer a fundamental shift in our health care system to for-profit health care provision.  That is not in the interests of our people.</p>

However, I would most of all like to thank the Fianna Fáil backbenchers for their contributions.  Their united silence was very telling.  They did not speak about the privatisation agenda and it is clear they are more in touch with the people than the Minister and the Minister of State, who defended the crazy scheme of handing over scarce resources at taxpayers' expense to private investors.  Deputy Moloney was a loyal last man standing in defending the Minister, but he is the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">This is an act of desperation.  The Government is facing into a general election and its members know that people will ask them on the doorsteps what happened to all of the promises.  What happened to the commitment to end the waiting lists?  What happened to the 200,000 medical cards?  The accident and emergency crisis still lumbers on.  The HSE produced figures today which show that 200 people are on trolleys, 62 of them waiting for over 24 hours, with 24 of them waiting even longer.  That is unacceptable, but that is the record.  The amendment put forward by the Government shows just how threadbare its standing is on the issue.  It talks about HIQA and about regulating nursing homes.  None of these things has been done, even though time and again we have asked the Government to release the legislation so that it can be debated in this House and to produce the regulatory framework that is urgently required to ensure that people are protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">I spoke today to the mother of Michelle Tallon, a mentally handicapped young woman who lost her life in a hospital.  The decision at the inquest was that death was due to medical misadventure.  This is one patient's tragedy.  This woman does not know where to turn.  There is no ombudsman or proper regulatory framework for public hospitals or public nursing home beds.  None of the commitment made by the Taoiseach in the aftermath of Leas Cross has been delivered.  Instead there is a proposal to which the Minister is committed, to privatise what she can within the health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">It is not good for the health service and it is not good for the majority of patients to have this kind of demarcation and separation and the institutionalisation of a two-tier system.  It is a squandering of an opportunity and the Minister of State knows it.  He knows that we deserve better.  Those of us who are sick, ailing and elderly deserve much better from a Government that has not delivered on its promises and is setting out to destroy the best in our health service.  Shame on you.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnCurranFF" eId="spk_643">
            <from>Mr. Curran</from>
            <p eId="para_1709">I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It concerns the conversion in Clondalkin village of what was an hotel to an accommodation facility for asylum seekers.  In recent days, concerns have been raised over the fact that this hotel was converted without the knowledge of the local authority, councillors or Members of this House who represent the area.  A silent deal seems to have been done without due regard to the local community.  I have mentioned the matter to the Minister who indicated to me that details of the arrangement were unknown to him in advance.  The deal has effectively converted an 80-room hotel in Clondalkin village into accommodation for up to 250 asylum seekers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">While I fully understand and appreciate that such accommodation is necessary, in this particular instance the location is most inappropriate.  It is inappropriate to try to locate 60 to 80 families in a hotel with no balconies, not an inch of green space and in an environment where all the local schools are short of capacity and have waiting lists for pupils.  This year, one of the schools in Clondalkin village had to arrange for additional capacity in a third classroom.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">The asylum hostel, as it is referred to locally, has come into being without anybody in the community having been contacted or consulted.  The long-term needs of asylum seekers in the hostel have not been considered and neither have the needs of the community.  There is a strong sense of disappointment that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is ultimately responsible, has not become engaged in the matter in any sense.  Ultimately, it will be a matter for the local authority and probably An Bord Pleanála to determine if the significant change in use from a hotel to a long-term residential facility requires planning permission.  Although the change was significant, there has been no consultation with the local community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">I have a number of questions for the Minister of State.  Can he postpone any further expansion of the facility until the community, the local authority and local representatives, including myself, are consulted about future developments?  Will discussions be entered into with the local authority to see if planning permission is required for such a change of use?  Will discussions be held with the Department of Education and Science to determine what will be the requirements, if any, of those residing in this asylum facility?  Will the Minister of State determine whether this is an appropriate facility?</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">The facility does not have a single balcony or open area.  When one walks out the back door of the hostel one is in a builders' providers yard on a main road, which seems most inappropriate.  I have noticed that colleagues who might be election candidates for some of the Opposition parties have raised fears about the facility.  I agree with some of their concerns.  It would be more appropriate to locate such a facility elsewhere because its current location will be of no benefit to asylum seekers or the local community.  It should be abandoned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">It is most frustrating that neither I nor other local representatives, including the Minister for Health and Children, were informed of this project in advance.  It was up and running before we knew about it.  When representatives from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform attend the Committee of Public Accounts tomorrow to discuss certain other sites which have been acquired, they will refer to the Department's openness.  However, there was no openness in this instance and absolutely no consultation or advance notice was given of the impact on the community.  We are most disappointed but I believe the Minister was personally unaware of the decision because I meet him regularly and, if he had known the facts, he would have revealed them to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">I urge the Minister to halt further work on this project until we have engaged in meaningful negotiations, which will be necessary if the hostel is to become part of our community.  In the interests of the community and the possible future residents of the institution, it cannot just be thrown into Clondalkin.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_644">
            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1716">I appreciate Deputy Curran's decision to raise this matter on behalf of his constituents in Clondalkin.  The reception and integration agency, RIA, is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers and is obliged to provide sufficient accommodation at all times to cater for the needs of persons who apply to the State for recognition as refugees under the 1951 Geneva Convention.  The service provided by the RIA is demand driven and must be capable of expanding and contracting in line with the numbers arriving into the State.  The task of providing accommodation presents considerable challenges to the RIA, which must continuously and actively manage its accommodation portfolio in regard to overall numbers, geographic location and value for money.  Changes in asylum policy can also place new demands on the geographical spread of accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">The RIA's portfolio currently consists of 55 centres accommodating 5,224 persons throughout the State.  The agency provides accommodation to asylum seekers primarily by way of direct provision, that is on a full board basis, as per a Government decision on this matter.  A small amount of self-catering accommodation is available and prioritised for persons with medical needs.  The current accommodation portfolio is made up of seven State owned direct provision centres, 41 commercially owned direct provision centres and nine commercially owned self-catering centres.  Under the commercial arrangements, the RIA does not acquire the property in the sense of purchasing it but contracts the properties for a fixed period in order to provide accommodation and board for asylum seekers at fixed prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">I reiterate that the RIA operates within a continuously changing dynamic and decisions on accommodation are made on the basis of the needs and requirements facing the agency at any time.  The agency operates with a view to achieving the best value for money for the Department and the State.  The Deputy should appreciate that demand driven organisations such as the RIA have to make decisions in real time and on the basis of available information.  A delicate balance has to be struck between long-term plans and budgetary responsibilities.  As part of this active portfolio management process and under responsibilities laid on all public bodies by the national public procurement framework, the RIA advertised in the national press on 10 July 2006 for expressions of interest from persons with regard to providing accommodation and ancillary services for asylum seekers.  It was in this context that an offer of accommodation in Clondalkin was made to the agency.  The Tánaiste also pointed out that the property in question was assessed by the RIA as suitable and that an arrangement was entered into without reference to him.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">In this instance, the urgent need for a new facility in Dublin, coupled with the commercial sensitivities surrounding the acquisition of the property prevented the RIA from engaging in any advance consultation process with local service providers.  As soon as it was possible to do so the RIA contacted, and is currently liaising with, relevant Departments and agencies to overcome any initial difficulties in this regard.  Discussions have opened with the relevant support groups and service providers and will intensify over the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">As regards the running of the centres, this is largely done through partnership initiatives with the commercial sector through fixed term contracts for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services.  These contracts include all day-to-day requirements, including full-board accommodation, heating, lighting, toiletries, laundry, housekeeping, cleaning materials and security.  Such a contract applies to the new centre at Clondalkin.  The Deputy will be aware that asylum seekers access many State services on exactly the same basis as the indigenous population.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">The Tánaiste would be concerned if the opening of this centre has generated fears and concerns within the local community.  This centre will accommodate some 65 families who have sought the protection of the State.  The Deputy can be assured that the RIA will work with all the stakeholders to address any fears that may arise.  Furthermore, it should be noted that the Tánaiste's constituency contains five accommodation centres for asylum seekers operating under the aegis of the RIA which accommodate some 320 persons.  There is no question, therefore, of Clondalkin or any other area being expected to shoulder a disproportionate burden in terms of the State meeting its obligations to asylum seekers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">I note the Deputy's request for a postponement of the expansion so that the local authority and the Department of Education and Science can be consulted.  I will not make a final judgment on the appropriateness of this facility and Deputy Curran will be aware that the Tánaiste is open to any issues the Deputy wishes to raise.  I am sure the RIA, along with all State agencies, will be fully compliant with their obligations to the local authority.  If an issue arises with regard to planning permission for change of use, I am sure the agency will take the appropriate action.</p>

Greencore's refusal is one of the most despicable acts to have been committed by a multinational company.  It is fundamental to the partnership agreements which have served this country well for the past 20 years that Labour Court recommendations are honoured.  If workers are to sign up to future partnerships, the State must do all it can to ensure Greencore honours its agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">The fourth clarification from the Labour Court on 17 October clearly states that the basis for payment of redundancy was agreed by the former workers of Irish Sugar.  Greencore issued a statement alleging the former workers would be paid on the double but that is absolute nonsense.  Former Irish Sugar workers have always said they would have accepted an adverse decision by the Labour Court, so it behoves all Members to ensure Greencore pays the recommended redundancy settlement.  Greencore is taking the State to court over the EU restructuring package but not one cent of this should be paid to the company unless it honours the Labour Court recommendations regarding its former workers.  These workers have gone to considerable efforts to build up the company, so they deserve recompense.</p>

            <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_1725">In its decision, the Labour Court expressed its disappointment that the company was unable to accept its invitation to enter a further meeting in a final attempt to resolve the impasse.  That statement was made in response to clarifications which were sought by the workers.  I find it almost incomprehensible that Greencore could refuse to comply with a Labour Court decision when it has the Minister for Agriculture and Food as its "golden share" director.  How can the Government have any credibility if it refuses to compel Greencore to deliver on what is expected and what is a reasonable Labour Court decision?</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">Today in Portlaoise, Pat Guilfoyle of the TEEU and Gerry McCormack of SIPTU met Joe Walsh from Greencore and Seán Brady from Irish Sugar in an attempt to resolve the issue.  Was the Minister aware of the meeting?  Is she aware that as a result of that meeting the two gentlemen from Greencore and Irish Sugar told the workers' representatives that they are not prepared to honour the Labour Court ruling?  They also said it was the same decision as delivered on 29 July to which the Minister was party, which is that the workers will not get their full entitlements.  Where does the Minister stand on the matter?  Is she prepared to exercise her rights as the holder of the golden share to pressurise Greencore to give in to the adjudication of the Labour Court.  We need this clarification.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">At present, 160 workers are out of work and living on social welfare assistance.  However, Greencore has assumed a public asset built for the workers, farmers and construction workers in the company in both Carlow and Mallow.  We had a vibrant industry that sustained rural Ireland for more than 80 years with plants in Thurles, Tuam, Carlow and Mallow.  This industry has been sold off by a multinational for its own profit and benefit.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food holds the golden share for the sole purpose of protecting the rights of the workers, producers and contractors.  Where does the Minister stand?  I want to know, as do the workers and producers who demand an answer and justice.  That justice can only come about when everybody gets his and her rightful entitlements.  Any company that ignores the Labour Court is a disgrace.</p>

            <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_1728">The question relates to the measures the Government plans to take to ensure that Greencore workers' rights to redundancy terms based on full unadjusted salary applicable at the date of redundancy plus 20% as provided in the agreement between the company and the union are upheld.  Greencore sent a letter to the Labour Court stating it was not in a position to come back to the court.  On 17 October the court expressed disappointment that the company was unable to accept the invitation to attend a further meeting in a final attempt to resolve the impasse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">As mentioned by the other speakers, the court also stated that for the avoidance of doubt it wished to state that it was intended in the recommendations that the staff on annualised salaries should have their <i>ex gratia</i> lump sum calculated by reference to their full unadjusted salary applicable at the date of redundancy plus 20% as provided in the agreement between the company and the union.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">I have received a copy of a document issued by the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, following her agreement allow sugar production to cease.  The document clearly referred to compensation for redundancy payments in line with recommendations of the Labour Court.  If the Minister stated that redundancy would be paid in accordance with the Labour Court recommendation, she has an obligation in that regard.</p>

          <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_648">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1731">I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">In March 2006, Greencore Group plc announced its intention to cease sugar production in Ireland completely.  The announcement followed an agreement on 24 November 2005 by EU Agriculture Ministers on a reform plan for the sugar industry involving cuts in the support price of sugar by 36% over four years.  The company duly closed the remaining factory at Mallow in May 2006, with 324 redundancies, and applied for EU restructuring aid in July.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">The agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime reached by the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in November 2005 provided for a scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry.  Under the scheme, aid is provided for three groups: the processor, beet growers and machinery contractors.  For Ireland, the aid available under the scheme is approximately €145 million.  Drawing down of the restructuring aid is conditional on the submission by the processor of an aid application to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, including a detailed restructuring plan for the industry.  The restructuring plan includes, among other matters, "a social plan detailing the actions planned in particular with respect to retraining, redeployment and early retirement of the workforce concerned".</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">The Government at its meeting on 12 July 2006 made certain decisions on the implementation of the restructuring aid.  The Government decided on the amount to be reserved for growers and contractors and provided an illustrative breakdown of the potential allocation of the aid to be followed by Greencore in preparing its restructuring plan, including a figure of €28.4 million for employee redundancy payments.  This figure as well as others in the Government decision was based on information supplied previously by Greencore.  These decisions, which were published by way of press release by the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the same day, are now the subject of judicial review proceedings instituted by Greencore.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">Greencore duly submitted an aid application in July 2006 committing to dismantle the Mallow factory fully.  The application stated that with regard to redundancy payments it was honouring the Labour Court recommendation.  The application was approved subject to the outcome of judicial review proceedings instituted by Greencore.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">The company and the trade unions entered negotiations regarding the redundancy package.  However, agreement was not reached on a number of issues and these were referred to the Labour Court.  On 26 April 2006, the Labour Court made a recommendation regarding the redundancy terms for Irish Sugar workers at the Mallow plant.  The recommendation provided that redundancy should be five weeks' pay per year of service, where a week's pay would be defined as actual finishing salary, excluding overtime, plus statutory redundancy entitlement, plus a bonus payment for an orderly wind-down.  The unions were not satisfied with the method for calculating finishing salary used by the company.  The court issued two clarifications in May, which failed to achieve a resolution to the dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">The Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2003 oblige employers to pay redundant employees what is known as "statutory redundancy entitlements".  The amount payable is related to the employee's length of service and his or her gross weekly earnings.  The entitlement is calculated on the basis of two weeks' pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a maximum wage ceiling of €600 per week.  Periods of lay-off or sickness of more than six months are not included in the calculation in respect of the last three years of employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">Employers who pay their workers their statutory redundancy entitlement and give them proper notice of being made redundant — at least two weeks — are entitled to a 60% rebate from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, financed by the social insurance fund.  In cases where an employer fails to make statutory redundancy payments, the Department steps in and pays the full amount directly to the employees from the social insurance fund, and then seeks recovery of the amount paid from the employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">I am assured that all former workers at the Mallow factory have received their statutory redundancy entitlements.  I understand a significant number of former workers have accepted the company's redundancy offer and have received payment from the company.  The remaining workers are disputing the company's non-statutory offer.  The trade unions representing workers who have not accepted the redundancy terms on offer, SIPTU and TEEU, balloted their members on industrial action.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">Industrial action was scheduled to begin on 4 October 2006, but was suspended following a request from the Labour Court for the parties to return to the court for further clarification of its recommendation.  The trade unions indicated that they would attend the court, but the company declined the offer.  I very much regret the decision taken by the company in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">The Labour Court issued a third clarification of its recommendation on 17 October 2006.  The content of this clarification is confidential to the parties and has not been published by the court.  The company has indicated it is not prepared to alter its offer.  Similarly, the trade unions have not changed their position and are not prepared to accept the company's existing offer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, has met representatives of both the trade unions and the company and urged them to resolve their differences and to avail of the dispute settling machinery of the State, as necessary.  I have also met union representatives to discuss this matter.  The national implementation body has worked with the parties concerned to seek to identify an agreed procedure to resolve the issue in dispute.  Ireland's system of industrial relations is essentially voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences rather than imposing a solution on the parties to an industrial dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">Where the Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal in trade disputes, its recommendations are not enforceable.  In such cases, the court hears both sides and then issues a recommendation setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it considers the dispute should be settled.  While these recommendations are not binding on the parties concerned, the parties are expected to give serious consideration to the court's recommendation.  As the Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and are consequently prepared to accept the outcome, namely, the Labour Court's recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">While responsibility for the settlement of a dispute ultimately rests with the parties themselves, I urge the company to reconsider its decision not to attend the Labour Court for talks.  The court remains available to the parties to advance a resolution to the dispute.  The experience and expertise of the Labour Court offer the best avenue for resolving the issue under dispute.</p>

          <heading>Motor Taxation.</heading>
          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_649">
            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_1745">This is a very important matter and I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to debate it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">Last year it was estimated that one in ten motorists were guilty of motor tax evasion.  That is many people and results in a lot of money being lost to the Exchequer.  The Department estimates that outstanding motor tax in October of last year amounted to €40 million, which is a very significant sum.  The Minister promised at the time that he would effect immediate and urgent anti-evasion measures, but we see no sign of these.  In March 2005, in a debate in the Dáil, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said he would push for the introduction of technology to detect motor tax dodgers automatically, but I see no sign of that either.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">Let me outline some facts.  The Garda's annual report for 2005 states proceedings were commenced against 34,000 people under road traffic legislation for not paying road tax, failing to display tax discs and other tax registration offences.  The 2001 survey entitled Motor Tax, Motor Insurance and NCT Compliance, which was made available to the Minister, stated that, of moving vehicles stopped over a given period, 15% had no tax discs displayed; of HGVs stopped, 33% had no motor tax — I could not believe this; and of motor cycles, 26% did not display a current tax disc.  The figures pertaining to vans and cars were 18% and 14%, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1748">This is a very serious issue which requires immediate resolution.  The Minister, Deputy Roche, referred on his website to the raising of this matter in the Dáil tonight.  Although I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, I am sorry the Minister is not present.  He should answer in the Dáil for not honouring the promises he made and for refusing to collect taxes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1749">I have a solution, which is used in the United Kingdom, where on renewal of one's tax disc, a notice is sent automatically.  In the United Kingdom one is told that if one does not renew the disc within the specified period, one will be issued immediately with a fine in excess of €100.</p>
            <p eId="para_1750">We do not want the Garda to stop all the cars throughout the country because that is not reasonable, nor do we want to waste our time.  Rather, we want new digital technology to read number-plates of vehicles that move at speed and check whether their owners pay their tax and insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">Ultimately the Minister must stop this scandal.  Our non-national roads, country roads, are underfunded and falling apart.  An extra €50 million per year is required to make them safe.  In the budget last year, only €31 million was allocated for this purpose instead of the €50 million needed.  This is where the Minister can bridge the gap, by obtaining the money.  Everybody should share the pain of improving our roads and no motorists should be on the road unless they pay tax — it is as simple as that.  The Minister has failed in his duty in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">It is desirable to have an automatic fine in cases where one does not renew one's tax disc, provided the car is not sold or scrapped because it is at the end of its life.  We need action from the Government.  It is reneging on its promise to run the country properly and provide money for roads.  The outstanding sum of €40 million is almost equal to the sum wasted on electronic voting machines, therefore, the Government cannot be taken seriously.  It is not doing its job in regard to this matter.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_650">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1753">I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The raising of this issue provides an opportunity to outline to the House the initiatives which have been introduced to combat motor tax evasion.  The administration of the motor tax service has been improved substantially in recent years with the implementation of the national vehicle and driver computer system, NVDF, which facilitates real-time transaction processing by all the motor tax outlets throughout the country.  Data from the NVDF are supplied to the Garda Síochána for motor tax enforcement purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1754">The NVDF has also facilitated the introduction of customer-focused initiatives such as on-line motor tax renewal and the taxing of new vehicles for the first time over the Internet.  This initiative has been received very favourably by the motoring public.  The statistics show that over 30% of all motorists eligible to do so pay their motor tax on-line, with a 50% take-up in Dublin.  The taxation system is now more efficient and accessible and local motor tax offices can effect a faster turnaround of tax applications submitted to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1755">In the year to the end of September 2006, motor tax receipts show a 10% increase as against the same period in 2005.  As this 10% is significantly greater than the increase in the national vehicle fleet, which amounts to 6%, and bearing in mind that there was no increase in motor tax rates for the period in question, it suggests a very positive performance in terms of motor tax compliance.  This is very much influenced by high profile Garda enforcement, particularly in recent times through the operation of the traffic corps in various road traffic and safety initiatives.  The increased levels of enforcement are also reflected in the increased levels of payment of motor tax arrears.  In the year to the end of September 2006 almost €19 million was collected, representing an increase of almost 11% over the same period in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">The last survey on motor tax compliance dating from 2001, as mentioned by Deputy O'Dowd, estimated a persistent evasion level of 4.6%, that is, the percentage of vehicles never taxed.  An evasion level of 4.6% equates to a revenue loss of €40 million in current terms.  However, as I have indicated, we feel the current position is significantly better.</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">Some measures that have been introduced or are in the pipeline contribute in themselves to enforcement of motor tax obligations.  For instance, the Garda may impound vehicles in respect of which motor tax has not been paid.  The recent Road Traffic Act reduced the period of non-payment from three to two continuous months.  Other enforcement initiatives are being developed by us in consultation with the Garda.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">Follow-up action by the Department in conjunction with local motor tax offices has taken place in regard to under-declarations of weight for heavy goods vehicles, in particular articulated tractor units and their drawing components.  The NVDF analysis indicates that an additional €1.1 million in motor tax was collected in the past year and this should be realised for each future year.  It is proposed to issue reminder tax notices and follow up owners of new vehicles which remain untaxed after they have been registered with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">To facilitate earlier taxation following the change of ownership of vehicles, we are introducing a system whereby approved motor dealers may notify ownership changes in respect of vehicles purchased and sold by them over the Internet.  This e-government project is in progress and will be operational in July or August 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">Arrangements have been made to issue motor tax renewal and reminder notices earlier to facilitate earlier taxing, and to reduce the period of "grace" whereby motor tax renewal applications are tolerated for up to a month after the disc expires.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">We are also taking action to reduce the incidence of "non-use" declarations in support of a period where motor tax has not been paid, commonly referred to as "gapping".</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">I am grateful for this opportunity to inform the House about the manner in which we are tackling motor tax evasion and the evidence of success we are already achieving in this important area.</p>

        <b>Mr. Ferris</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
         if his attention has been drawn to a statement made by the UN’s Deputy Secretary General to the effect that he believes the European Commission will in future represent the EU in the United Nations as the voice of the European block worldwide; and if he will give a commitment to resist such effort to diminish this State’s right to its own independent voice in international affairs and in the UN.

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_651">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1764">I am aware that Mr. Mark Malloch Brown, the UN Deputy-Secretary-General, during a recent visit to Brussels reportedly expressed the view that the European Commission might in future represent the EU in the UN General Assembly. I understand that he said this in response to a question and the exact scope of his comment is not clear. I would be surprised if the interpretation advanced by the Deputy were accurate. In any event I am sure that Mr. Malloch Brown's intention was to stimulate debate. As I know from my own dealings with him, including in November 2005, when he made a thought-provoking address to a Seminar organised by my Department with the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) to mark the Fiftieth Anniversary of Ireland's UN membership, Mr. Malloch Brown is very ready to speculate creatively about long-term issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">To give effect to any such role for the Commission would require major changes in the institutional architecture of both the UN and the EU. I do not believe that such changes are likely.</p>
            <p eId="para_1766">Article 4 of the UN Charter provides that UN membership is open only to States. All EU Member States are also UN members. The Commission, in common with representatives of other regional organisations, has observer status. The Commission can speak at UN meetings within its competencies, normally in the trade and development cooperation areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">The question of EU representation at the UN, in particular in the Security Council, was most recently discussed in the context of negotiations on the EU's Constitutional Treaty. However there was no agreement to go beyond the arrangements set out in Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union, which provides that Member States shall coordinate their action in international organisations and at international conferences and shall uphold the common positions in such forums. Even if there had been agreement to go further, I cannot imagine the Member States collectively ceding their role in foreign policy to the Commission. The current position is that the Presidency speaks on behalf of the EU at UN meetings where the Member States agree and there is a united EU position. Ireland and other Member States contribute to the drafting of such statements. This allows the European Union to project our common interests and values forcefully at the UN. However it is not always possible or appropriate to have common EU statements and on such occasions Ireland and other Member States address UN meetings and conferences in their national capacity. At the General Debate in the General Assembly individual Member States speak — as I did on behalf of Ireland last month — but there is also a Presidency statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">The UN occupies a central place in our foreign policy. I could not envisage a situation whereby an Irish Government would forego its right to have its representatives speak at UN meetings, either to the EU Commission or to any other body, but I would be very surprised if this were ever seriously proposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">As regards the Security Council, there is no serious prospect of agreement on a single EU seat. I cannot envisage either the UK or France agreeing to abandon their status as Permanent Members. Moreover, at present three other EU Members are present on the Council as non-permanent members — Denmark, Greece and Slovakia — and the multiplicity of voices reinforces the overall impact of the European perspective.</p>

            <p eId="para_1771">The issue of access to Turkish ports for Cypriot vessels continues to create difficulties, not least in the context of Turkey's EU accession negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">The June 2006 European Council recalled the need for Turkey to fulfil its obligations under the Association Agreement and the additional Ankara Protocol, which takes account of the accession of the new Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus. Turkey's progress in fulfilling these obligations, which include the need to recognise the economic, maritime and navigational rights of all EU Member States, as well as its implementation of the revised Accession Partnership, will be evaluated by the European Commission in a report that is due to be published on 8 November. Based on the Commission's report, the November General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) will review the enlargement process and the progress of the Turkish negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">The Finnish Presidency is currently working on an initiative aimed at resolving the question of access to Turkish ports for Cypriot vessels in compliance with the Ankara Protocol. We fully support these efforts by the Presidency and hope that they will lead to a timely resolution of this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">With regard to enlargement, it has always been our policy to consider each candidate on the basis of its own merits. This principle will continue to underpin our approach to the negotiations with Turkey. While there are difficult issues to be dealt with in the course of these particular negotiations, Ireland believes that it is important for the Union to adhere to the commitments given to Turkey by successive European Councils. It is essential also that Turkey should fulfil its obligations, including the full implementation of the Ankara Protocol. Ireland expects Turkey to comply with the requirement to open its ports to vessels from all EU Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus.

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1779">I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 93, 98 and 132 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">In regard to the recent testing of a nuclear explosive device by the DPRK, I would refer the Deputies to the reply I have just given to the priority question on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">As I stated in that reply, I immediately strongly condemned this provocative action by the DPRK. It is a serious threat to the security and stability of the region, as well as a direct contravention of the international objectives of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. It is clear from the many statements calling on the DPRK not to perform its intended test, including that made by the EU, that this action ignored the will of the international community. It also ran counter to the patient efforts of the DPRK's neighbours to work constructively to find a diplomatic solution through the Six Party Talks process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">On 14 October, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1718 condemning the DPRK's test and empowering the international community to enforce specific sanctions. These sanctions include an arms embargo, as well as a ban on any items which could contribute to the DPRK's nuclear, ballistic missile or WMD programmes. In addition, the Resolution requires that all funds, economic resources and financial assets, connected to the trafficking of such items and their respective programmes, be frozen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">At the meeting last week of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, Ministers committed the EU to the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1718, as well as Resolution 1695, adopted in July in response to the DPRK's earlier controversial ballistic missile tests. We are currently taking the necessary steps to ensure Ireland's full compliance with these two resolutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">I believe that it is still possible to achieve a diplomatic solution to the current crisis through the Six Party Talks process. I would urge the DPRK to return to these talks immediately and without precondition and work towards the implementation of the Joint Statement of September 2005 and the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">As regards the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the testing of a nuclear explosive device by DPRK is a matter of grave concern. Since the DPRK's announced withdrawal from the NPT in 2003, and subsequent declaration that it possesses nuclear weapons, the international community has consistently urged the DPRK to abandon its policy, completely dismantle its nuclear weapons programme and comply fully with its obligations under the NPT.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">With respect to the New Agenda Coalition, Ireland, together with our partners in the group, has tabled a resolution at the current session of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly emphasising the central role of the NPT in achieving nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and condemning the DRPK's test of a nuclear device. If there is a clear conclusion from this act of defiance by the DPRK, it is the importance of the NPT and the non-proliferation regime it establishes to international peace and security.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">We hope that this latest incident will serve as an impetus to the international community to redouble its efforts to strengthen all aspects of the disarmament and non-proliferation regime, not least the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which has yet to enter into force.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1790">I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 108 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">There has not been any recent direct bilateral contact with the Government of Burma. In 2004 the Government put on hold the exchange of non-resident Ambassadors with Burma, and any decision to proceed with an exchange of Ambassadors will have to await positive and significant moves by the Burmese Government. However, at the ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting) Summit held in Helsinki last month, the Taoiseach raised the situation in Burma in the presence of the Burmese Foreign Minister and called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. Burma attended as a member of ASEAN (the Association of South East Asian Nations) and was the only participant at the Summit not invited at Head of State or Government level. The EU Troika met with the Foreign Minister in the margins of the Summit to reinforce the EU's strong concerns about the lack of progress in Burma.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">In my statement on behalf of Ireland to the 61st Session of the UN General Assembly on 26 September, I referred to the particularly grave human rights situation in Burma. I called, once again, on the Burmese régime to move towards democracy and to release all political prisoners, in particular Aung San Suu Kyi. These statements by the Taoiseach and myself are consistent with the strong position on Burma which Ireland takes on all possible occasions, including in the European Union framework and at the United Nations. Together with our EU partners, we avail of all opportunities to call for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi, to condemn the abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms and deplore the lack of progress towards democracy in Burma.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">The visit by UN Under-Secretary-General (UN USG) Gambari to Burma from 18-20 May was the first high-level visit to that country by a UN representative in more than two years. I welcome the fact that he was able to meet with the most senior Burmese leaders as well as with Aung San Suu Kyi and representatives of her party, the National League for Democracy, during the visit. It is vitally important that the Burmese government allow the UN to play a role in promoting common ground between the government and the National League for Democracy so that the resumed National Convention can proceed in a more inclusive way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">I remain deeply concerned that Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained continuously for over three years without charge and, once more, urge the Burmese government to restore fully her freedom and civil liberties. UN USG Gambari's visit in May generated high hopes that her detention under house arrest, which was up for renewal a few days after he left Burma, might not be renewed by the authorities. This did not happen. On 27 May, the EU issued a statement which deeply regretted the decision of the Burmese government to extend the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and deplored the fact that international appeals, including that of the EU, had once again gone unheard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">The UN Security Council recently decided to include Burma on its agenda. On foot of this, UNSG Gambari briefed the Security Council on 29 September. This was the first time that the UN Security Council has discussed Burma as a formal item on its agenda. This is a welcome development. In this regard also, I welcome the news that UN USG Gambari is due to pay a return visit to Burma in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">I will continue to raise concerns about Burma on all possible occasions and to call on the Burmese government to assume its responsibilities towards its people and to allow the fullest possible UN involvement in a genuine process of democratisation and reconciliation.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1798">Last year President Bush of the United States and Prime Minister Singh of India agreed to establish a new strategic partnership between their two countries. One element of that partnership was a proposed agreement on civil nuclear cooperation. During a visit to India by President Bush on 2 March 2006, the two leaders announced that agreement had been reached.</p>
            <p eId="para_1799">The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a group of 45 participating countries, including Ireland, with agreed guidelines governing the export of items that are specially designed or prepared for nuclear use and for nuclear related dual-use goods. Under these guidelines the export of such items to India is prohibited and the question has arisen whether the guidelines should be changed, or an exemption granted to India so that the proposed US-India agreement may proceed. Given India's position as a non-signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), this raises some fundamental concerns for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1800">Since the 2 March announcement, three discussions on the proposed agreement have been held at the NSG. Ireland has played an active role, along with several other countries, in seeking both to question and to clarify a number of issues relating to the agreement. Some of the questions related to the proposed parallel safeguards agreement between India and the IAEA, as well as plans to separate India's civil and military nuclear facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">In the margins of the most recent NSG meeting in Vienna on 11-13 October, representatives of the Indian Government were in attendance to brief NSG participants. We welcomed this first direct engagement by India with the NSG and took the opportunity to raise a number of our concerns. This particular NSG meeting was not empowered to take decisions but provided a further occasion to exchange information and share perspectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">On 18 October I received the Prime Minister of India's Special Envoy on Civil Nuclear Cooperation, Mr Shyam Saran. He set out clearly the Indian Government's argument that the deal would in practice strengthen non-proliferation. This view has also been taken by Dr El Baradei, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). While recognizing India's energy needs and its great and growing economic and political importance, I conveyed to him Ireland's deep-rooted commitment to the NPT and reiterated our disappointment that India remained outside it. I also stressed Ireland's concerns over the potential impact of the deal on the NPT and the global disarmament and non-proliferation regime. Useful technical discussions were also held at official level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">The next NSG Plenary meeting is currently scheduled for April 2007 in South Africa. It is uncertain whether participants at this meeting will be called upon to make a final decision. This will largely depend on the pace and outcome of India's negotiations with the IAEA, as well as of the legislative process in the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">Ultimately, our final view will depend on our assessment of the potential impact of the deal on the global non-proliferation regime, but also on the approach taken by normally like-minded countries and the overall balance of views within the NSG.</p>

            <p eId="para_1808">I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 119 and 139 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">The question of Iran's nuclear programme is kept under constant review within the European Union at official level and is also the subject of regular discussions at Ministerial level. The most recent such discussion was at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting of 16-17 October in Luxembourg. At that meeting Ministers discussed the latest developments, including the most recent talks between High Representative Solana and lead Iranian negotiator Ali Larijani.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">I would recall that on 6 June last, High Representative Solana, on behalf of the EU3 as well as China, Russia and the United States, presented a package of incentives to Iran containing a framework for a wider agreement through which a peaceful and acceptable resolution to the issue of its nuclear programme could be found. The European Council endorsed this package on 16 June. Negotiations on the package were to commence once Iran had suspended its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, as requested by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">Following two unsuccessful meetings in early July between High Representative Solana and Ali Larijani to clarify the contents of the package, and mindful of the confirmation by the IAEA that Iran was accelerating its enrichment programme, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1696 on 31 July. This resolution made suspension of Iran's enrichment activities mandatory and set a deadline of 31 August. The Security Council also stated its intention to adopt a further resolution imposing additional measures, including sanctions, should Iran not be in compliance by this date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">Iran did not respect the 31 August deadline. Determined, however, to exhaust all avenues before returning to the Security Council, and in light of Iran's response in the meantime to the June package of incentives, High Representative Solana agreed to meet with Mr. Larijani in early September to explore whether an acceptable formula for commencing negotiations could be agreed. The first session of these discussions proceeded positively and the key issue of suspension was addressed. However, a second session, held in Berlin on 27-28 September, failed to produce a formula for the commencement of negotiations. The EU side has been obliged, reluctantly, to conclude that Iran is not at this stage seriously interested in responding to the generous offer made to it in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">Last week's meeting of the Council therefore concluded that the time had now come for consultations in the Security Council on a further resolution imposing some form of sanctions on Iran. While regrettable, this now seems essential if the authority of the Security Council and its resolutions are to be maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">It is deeply disappointing that Iran continues to disregard Security Council Resolution 1696 but the matter of sanctions is now, as a consequence, under consideration in New York. Should the Security Council consider it necessary to adopt a further resolution imposing additional measures in the form of sanctions on the Iranian regime, then Ireland will, of course, abide by this decision in conformity with its obligations under the UN Charter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">I would, however, wish to stress that recourse to the Security Council should not be interpreted as abandonment of the possibility of negotiations and agreement on the June package of incentives. I still believe that this package offers a real opportunity to secure benefits for all sides. I would strongly urge Iran to do what is necessary so that a peaceful and acceptable resolution to the current impasse can be found.</p>

            <p eId="para_1817">There have been a number of recent developments following the crisis in Timor-Leste (formerly known as East Timor) in late April. The former Foreign Minister Dr Jose Ramos-Horta was appointed as Prime Minister on 10 July, with a new government formed shortly thereafter. Prime Minister Ramos-Horta and President Gusmão have both committed themselves to achieving reconciliation without sacrificing accountability for crimes committed during the past months. However, the situation remains fragile, with many of the underlying causes of the crisis still to be addressed. The number of internally displaced persons remains high.</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">The Independent Special Commission of Inquiry for Timor-Leste presented its report on 17 October. The Commission was established in June under the auspices of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights to look into the facts and circumstances surrounding the events in April/May. The Commission has stated its view that the crisis could largely be explained by the frailty of State institutions and the weakness of the rule of law. As the Commission notes, justice, peace and democracy are mutually reinforcing imperatives, and the report underlines the need for a substantial and long-term effort on the part of the Timorese Government and its international partners to address the challenges facing the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">In part this work has already begun. On 25 August the UN Security Council unanimously decided to establish a new, expanded operation for the country — the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT).  UNMIT's mandate includes supporting the Government in "consolidating stability, enhancing a culture of democratic governance, and facilitating dialogue... to bring about a process of national reconciliation".  The Mission will also support the country in all aspects of the 2007 Presidential and parliamentary electoral process, and will seek to ensure the restoration and maintenance of pubic security.  In line with our long-standing commitment to Timor-Leste, Ireland fully supports the UN's continued role.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">The impact of the disturbances on the people of Timor-Leste remains a matter of concern to the Government, and Ireland continues to be committed to supporting the development efforts of that country.  Minister of State Lenihan announced, on 19 October, further Irish support of €1.14 million to assist Timor-Leste with the aftermath of the crisis. This is additional to the €500,000 announced in June for humanitarian relief, and brings to over €6.5 million the amount which Irish Aid will provide in direct support to Timor-Leste in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">The additional funding will be targeted at the underlying causes of instability, including youth unemployment. It will also provide support for the holding of parliamentary and presidential elections in 2007, as well as in the justice sector and human rights monitoring.  The overall objective of Ireland's assistance to Timor-Leste has been to support the government of Timor-Leste and civil society in reducing poverty by delivering essential social services and by strengthening governance and human rights.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1832">I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 94, 115, 117, 124, 140, 147 and 217 to 219, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">I would also refer the Deputies to Priority Question No. 76, which I answered today.</p>
            <p eId="para_1834">While it is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide, I would support the tabling of an all-party motion of Dáil and Seanad Éireann on the crisis in Darfur, urging the Sudanese Government to permit the deployment of a UN force as provided for in Security Council Resolution 1706 and indicating clearly the opposition of the Irish people to the conflict and loss of life in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1835">Last July, I visited Sudan to see conditions in Darfur first-hand and also met the Sudanese Foreign Minister. I told the Minister that Ireland supported transition to a UN force and emphasised the need to improve humanitarian access.  The security situation was poor then and has deteriorated significantly since.  As the UN Secretary General warned in his report of 5 October, Darfur is at a critical stage, with insecurity at its highest levels and humanitarian access at its lowest levels since 2004.  Two rebel factions who refused to sign the May 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement have been intensifying their military activities.  Furthermore, those parties who did sign this Agreement, including the Sudanese Government, have been guilty of widespread and significant ceasefire violations.  I am particularly concerned at a renewed offensive by the Sudanese Army in Northern Darfur, which is causing further suffering and displacement.  The escalating violence is preventing humanitarian organisations from reaching war and drought-affected people.  An estimated 224,000 people are currently cut off from food aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1836">On 26 September, I raised Ireland's concerns about Darfur in my address to the UN General Assembly and in bilateral meetings in New York with the UN Secretary General and the Sudanese Foreign Minister.  I used these occasions to underline that humanitarian aid must be delivered safely and without restrictions; that there must be a transition to a substantial UN peace-keeping force with a robust mandate in Darfur; and that long-term security in Darfur can only be guaranteed by the full implementation of the Peace Agreement.  In addition, I reminded my Sudanese counterpart of the need to avoid repeating the tragedy in Rwanda and underlined the plight of the internally displaced in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_1837">On 17 October, the General Affairs and External Relations Council expressed deep concern at the appalling security, humanitarian and human rights situation in Darfur and called for an immediate end to the ongoing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.  The Council urged all parties in the strongest terms to halt the violence, to protect civilians and to ensure the full, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance.  The Sudanese Government was reminded of its collective and individual responsibility for protecting its citizens from violence and guaranteeing respect for human rights.  The Council called on the non-signatories to commit to the Darfur Peace Agreement.  On 20 October the Taoiseach discussed Darfur with other EU Heads of State or Government at the Informal European Council in Lahti, Finland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">Until transition to a UN force can take place, AMIS must be strengthened as far as possible, and therefore the EU has given it extensive political, technical and financial support.  Ireland has provided €3 million, including €1.5 million pledged in July to ensure that the mission can fulfil its mandate through to the end of this year.  Four personnel from the Permanent Defence Forces have also served with AMIS. Since 2004, Ireland has also provided over €16 million in humanitarian assistance to Darfur, including over €6 million during 2006. Overall, Ireland has provided over €32 million to Sudan since 2004.  This money has been used to support the active involvement of the specialist UN agencies, including the World Food Programme, the World Health Organisation and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and Irish NGOs on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">The EU, the US, the Arab League and senior African statesmen are continuing efforts to persuade Sudan to accept a UN force in Darfur.  However, we need to be prepared to take further steps if the Sudanese position does not change.  Ireland and the EU already enforce a comprehensive arms embargo on Sudan, which has been in place since 1994.  We also implement a travel ban and assets freeze on a Sudanese airforce commander, a Janjaweed leader and two rebels who have been designated by the UN Security Council as impeding the Darfur peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">As regards contacts with the Ethiopian Government, I met Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in Addis Ababa in July 2006 and I wrote to him on 15 September to urge him to encourage the President of Sudan to accept the deployment of the UN operation in Darfur, with a strong mandate for the protection of civilians and provision of security for the delivery of humanitarian assistance.  I also discussed the transition to a UN force with the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia while I was in Addis Ababa and found his approach to this issue to be positive and constructive.</p>

            <p eId="para_1842">Unresolved difficulties in relations between Georgia and Russia give rise to recurring bouts of tension. The problems relate to the persistence of "frozen conflicts" in the separatist Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which unsuccessfully sought independence from Georgia in the aftermath of the dissolution of the former USSR and which continue to be supported politically by Russia. Moreover, since the so-called "Rose Revolution" of 2003, Georgia has strongly pursued membership of NATO and closer links with the EU. Its orientation towards NATO, in particular, is viewed by Russia with suspicion. In response to perceived provocations earlier this year, Russia banned imports of Georgian mineral water and wine, invoking health and safety reasons. It has also closed the only official land crossing between the two countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">While relations had been deteriorating for some time, it was the arrest on 27 September of 4 Russian officers in Tbilisi for spying which precipitated the current crisis. Thanks to the efforts of the Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE, Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht, and following strong interventions from the EU and the US, Georgia released the officers on Oct 2 and they were immediately flown back to Russia. Russia persisted nevertheless in cutting rail, air and postal links and in focusing official attention on the activities of Georgian nationals living in Russia. It has given no sign that it intends to rescind any of these measures. I understand that hundreds of Georgian citizens living in Russia have been deported and that some Georgian-owned businesses have been forced to close. The combined effect of all these measures on the Georgian economy could be substantial.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">The EU has been deeply engaged in efforts to resolve this crisis from the start, maintaining close contacts with both sides. The General Affairs and External Relations Council at its meeting on 17 October adopted Conclusions on Georgia/Russian Federation relations which expressed the EU's grave concern at the recent escalation of tensions, stressed the importance of toning down public rhetoric and called upon both sides to reopen normal diplomatic dialogue in order to work towards a normalisation of relations. The Council expressed its grave concern at the economic, political and humanitarian consequences of the measures taken against Georgia. It urged Russia not to pursue measures targeting Georgians living in the Russian Federation and called on both parties to act in a manner consistent with their international commitments and obligations. The Council reiterated the EU's willingness to work with Georgia and Russian to facilitate mutual confidence building and contribute to a peaceful resolution of the crisis. At the informal European Council at Lahti last Friday, the EU's concerns on this matter were conveyed to President Putin.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1846">EU Battlegroups are being developed under the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). ESDP is an integral part of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1847">Strengthening the ability of the EU to be able to respond quickly to emerging crises is a key objective of the development of the ESDP, and has been specifically supported by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan. An important aspect of ESDP is the development of a standby military rapid response capacity, in the form of Battlegroups. All our partners in the EU — with the exception of Denmark, which has an opt-out in this area, and Malta — have made commitments to contribute to a specific Battlegroup formation. Ireland indicated to its EU partners in 2004 a positive disposition to taking part in Battlegroups.</p>
            <p eId="para_1848">Following an interdepartmental report to the Minister for Defence on Battlegroups and subsequent consideration by the Government, representatives from the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Defence Forces have met with Sweden, as framework nation, to discuss possible participation by the Defence Forces in the Nordic Battlegroup. This is due to be on standby during the first half of 2008, and at present has commitments from Sweden, Finland, Norway and Estonia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1849">Our representatives outlined Ireland's position in relation to international peacekeeping generally and provided information on the capabilities which Ireland could make available to a Battlegroup. Following the most recent meetings, detailed parameters of a possible contribution by Ireland to the Nordic Battlegroup are being worked through and are close to finalisation. The Minister for Defence informed the House on 12 October that the total number of personnel involved is expected to be somewhere between 80 and 100, comprising an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)/Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (IEDD) contingent with its own security detail, together with staff posts at the Operational and Force headquarters. I understand from the Minister for Defence that he expects to bring the matter to Government for decision shortly. My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Defence, the Permanent Defence Forces and our Nordic and Estonian partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1850">I welcome the fact that progress is being made on an Irish contribution to EU Battlegroups. This is very much in keeping with our traditional commitment to UN peacekeeping and responds to the specific request of the UN Secretary General. It is appropriate that our first involvement is likely to be with the Nordic Battlegroup, given our strong ties with the Nordic countries in UN peacekeeping.</p>
            <p eId="para_1851">Any decision on the actual deployment of the Irish contingent in an operation as part of the Battlegroup will, of course, be a matter for sovereign decision, and the requirements of the "triple lock" of Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation will have to be satisfied.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1855">I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 104 and 153 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">Three Principal Development Specialists serve in Irish Aid headquarters in Dublin. None of the three has applied to decentralise to Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">There are twelve Senior Development Specialists at Irish Aid headquarters. None of the twelve is applying to decentralise to Limerick, though two originally did so, but subsequently withdrew their applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">Finally, there are nine Development Specialist posts at headquarters. At present five specialists are scheduled to decentralise, four who commenced employment since the announcement of the decentralisation programme in December 2003, and one who applied via the Central Applications Facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">There is an ongoing Labour Court case regarding the terms and conditions under which technical grades are employed in various areas of the public service, including the specialists employed by Irish Aid. Technical staff employed by Government Departments and Offices, including specialists and other fixed-term workers employed in Irish Aid, brought cases to the Rights Commissioner under the Protection of Employees (Fixed–Term Work) Act, 2003. The case, which involves complex legal issues, has been referred to the European Court of First Instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">Some of the issues involved in the decentralisation of Irish Aid to Limerick have, therefore, a wider Civil Service dimension and must be resolved at the central level. Discussions are on-going with representatives of the specialists, with their union IMPACT, and with the Department of Finance about the issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1861">Decentralisation is a Government decision and the Government is committed to moving ahead with its implementation. At present, 47 posts in the Directorate are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. A further 17 officers who are serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, are also expected to decentralise to Limerick and will be taking up duty in Irish Aid in advance of the move. In addition, 21 officers from other Departments who have applied to decentralise to Limerick, most of whom are currently based in provincial locations, will transfer to the Department closer to the date of the move. Once these officers take up duty in Irish Aid, 85 posts (69% of the Directorate's staff complement) will be in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1862">A small number of staff, approximately 15 at entry grades, will be recruited for direct assignment to Limerick in the months preceding the move.</p>
            <p eId="para_1863">Almost all of the senior management team for Limerick will be in place by the end of this year. The Director General of Irish Aid has already indicated that he will decentralise to Limerick. There are now five Counsellors in place in the Directorate, who have volunteered to go to Limerick and a further three Counsellors will take up duty over the next two months. The changeover of the senior management team, just as in other grades, has been implemented in a planned and careful way so as to minimise disruption to the business of the Directorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1864">While there are challenges ahead, management and staff are working effectively together to maintain the quality and integrity of the programme. It would be my hope that a greater number of specialists will, in time, volunteer to decentralise to Limerick.</p>

            <p eId="para_1867">I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 151 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">HIV/AIDS is one of the foremost challenges in development, especially in Africa. The recently launched White Paper on Irish Aid reaffirms the priority attached by the Government to addressing the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p>
            <p eId="para_1869">The Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Institution provides assistance to countries to implement care, treatment and prevention programmes that can reverse the course of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870">Three years ago the Government signed an agreement with President Clinton, committing the Government to allocating 50 million US dollars to HIV/AIDS treatment programmes in developing countries. Mozambique was selected as the initial country of focus for the partnership. It is greatly affected by HIV with more than 16% of adults infected. The additional resources have enabled the Government of Mozambique to successfully introduce HIV treatment into its public health response to HIV/AIDS. At the end of June, over 27,000 people were on treatment. Excellent progress has been made, but this is only 10% of those needing treatment and there are still big challenges ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">Having regard to the results achieved to date, the challenges still faced, and an interim review of the partnership, the Government has decided to extend the partnership with the Clinton Foundation in Mozambique. A new development is that the partnership is being expanded to Lesotho. Lesotho, one of Irish Aid's partner countries, has one of the worst rates of HIV in the world and this is both a human tragedy and a tremendous barrier to development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1872">On 29th September, the Taoiseach signed a new agreement with President Clinton. This agreement builds on the existing partnership and commits the Government to continue working with the Foundation up to 2010. The agreement commits Irish Aid to work jointly with the Foundation in Mozambique and Lesotho towards the achievement of three goals:- to provide financial and technical support towards the implementation of national plans for the prevention, treatment, care and support of people affected by HIV/AIDS; to contribute towards the strengthening of the health system; and to respond to the crisis of human resources for health.</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">Of the €70 million committed to the partnership with the Clinton Foundation, €60 million will go to Mozambique and €10 million to Lesotho. This support will be channelled through Ireland's missions in each country to the respective Ministries of Health. Irish Aid will meet with representatives from the Clinton Foundation in these countries on a regular basis to review cooperation and ensure the continued success of the partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_1874">This is an important partnership and represents a major contribution by the Government to fighting HIV/AIDS and achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>

         the progress made in the decentralisation of his Department’s overseas aid division, Irish Aid, to Limerick; if he is satisfied that the staff levels, expertise, and resources available to Irish Aid will be adequate to administer the aid programme effectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1881">Under the Government's decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid's Headquarters, and currently based in Dublin, will decentralise to Limerick. This is scheduled to take place during the third quarter of 2007 and will involve the relocation to Limerick of 124 posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1882">The situation is as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1883">Already, 47 posts in Irish Aid headquarters, including that of Director General, are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. 12 of these officers were already serving within the Department. The remainder is made up of 25 officers who have been recruited from other Departments and Offices via the Central Applications Facility, 7 officers who have been assigned from inter-Departmental promotion panels and 3 newly-recruited officers.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1884">A further 17 officers who are serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, are also expected to decentralise to Limerick and will be taking up duty in Irish Aid in advance of the move.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1885">In addition, 21 officers from other Departments who have applied to decentralise to Limerick, most of whom are currently based in provincial locations, will transfer to the Department closer to the date of the move. Once these officers take up duty in Irish Aid, 85 posts (69% of the Directorate's staff complement) will be in place.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1886">A small number of staff, approximately 15 at entry grades (Clerical Officer and Third Secretary), will be recruited locally for direct assignment to Limerick in the months preceding the move.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887">There are 24 development specialist posts attached to Irish Aid's headquarters. Four Development Specialists and two Senior Development Specialists, who had applied to decentralise, have since decided to withdraw their applications. The specialists, with the support of the IMPACT trade union, say that they are not prepared to consider decentralising while issues around the terms and conditions of their employment are unresolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">Discussions are continuing with representatives of the specialists, with IMPACT, and with the Department of Finance with a view to resolving the issues involved which also have a wider Civil Service dimension. It would be my hope that a greater number of Specialists will, in time, volunteer to decentralise to Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_1889">The transfer of Irish Aid to Limerick presents significant challenges. Risk management issues are being addressed through planning and risk management strategies. This involves adequate handover periods in order to ensure the retention of corporate memory. Appropriate training and induction courses are being provided and will continue to be provided for new staff. Staffing changes are being phased, in order to facilitate this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1890">The White Paper on Irish Aid recognises that the enormous expansion in the size of the aid programme will place heavy demands on those administering it. The Government has committed to undertaking a major review of the management of the Irish Aid programme. The review will embrace the financial and administrative systems, including approval, monitoring, audit and evaluation mechanisms, management information systems and the management and technical competencies necessary to guide the programme through this era of growth.</p>

            <p eId="para_1895">The European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) is an integral part of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the principles and objectives of which are set out in the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice Treaties, which were approved by the Irish people at successive referenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_1896">The Treaties specify that the objectives of the CFSP include safeguarding the common values, fundamental interests, independence and integrity of the Union in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter, strengthening the security of the Union in all ways, developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. In addition to a wide range of diplomatic activities, the actions of the Union in support of these objectives can include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1897">All decisions on the establishment of specific ESDP missions are subject to unanimity in the Council. In deciding on possible Irish contributions to ESDP missions, the Government are guided by our assessment of the context and purpose of the mission, and of the potential role we might play. Under the Defence Acts, as recently amended, any deployment of Irish troops remains subject to the ‘triple-lock' of Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1898">As I have previously reported to the House, I met the Foreign Ministers of Sweden and Finland in January 2005 and the Foreign Minister of Austria in April 2005 to discuss a range of issues, including possible Irish participation in Battlegroups. I also had the opportunity to discuss Ireland's anticipated participation in the Nordic Battlegroup with the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Jonas Gahr Store, during the visit of the Norwegian Royal couple in September. Discussion of current CFSP and ESDP issues also takes place at the monthly meetings of EU Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1899">My reply today to another question provides detailed information on recent developments with regard to Ireland's participation in EU Battlegroups.  Finally, further information on current ESDP activities can be found in the Presidency report to the June European Council, available on the European Union's Europa website.</p>

        <b>Mr. S. Ryan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
         his view as to whether the Proliferation Security Initiative, led by the United States since May 2003, is of assistance to or undermines the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
        [34509/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_666">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1901">The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) was launched in Krakow, Poland on 31 May 2003. The decision to establish PSI originated in part from an incident in December 2002, when Spain intercepted an un-flagged vessel carrying a shipment of Scud missiles, en route from North Korea to Yemen. The ship was subsequently allowed to continue. In response to this incident, a group of countries, led by the United States, agreed to cooperate to interdict vessels on the high seas and to ground aircraft worldwide, which are suspected of carrying Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), their delivery systems and related materials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1902">States participating in PSI activities operate under their own domestic law and in conformity with international law. A Statement of Interdiction Principles was agreed in Paris on 4 September 2003, outlining how suspect vessels could be detained and searched on entering a PSI State's territory, territorial waters or airspace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1903">In May 2004, under the Irish Presidency, the EU adopted a statement of support for the PSI. The statement noted that the EU Strategy against the proliferation of WMD contains a number of measures to prevent, deter, halt and, if possible, eliminate proliferation programmes that cause concern at the global level. One of these measures seeks to improve identification, control and interception of illegal trafficking, and, in particular, to provide support for international initiatives aimed at the identification, control and interception of illegal shipments. The statement went on to note that the principal purpose of the PSI complemented well the objectives set out in this Strategy and that the EU and its Member States fully endorsed and subscribed to the PSI Statement of Interdiction Principles.</p>
            <p eId="para_1904">As regards the impact on the Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), I would note that the scope of PSI activities is much broader than the area of nuclear weapons and covers all WMD, including chemical and biological weapons, as well as their means of delivery. I do not consider that the objectives of the NPT are undermined by activities designed to prevent the acquisition of materials necessary for the production of nuclear weapons or their means of delivery; indeed the reverse is the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1905">I would also note, in this connection, that Ireland participates in a number of international export control regimes that regulate the supply of sensitive goods that have the potential to be used in the production of WMD or their delivery systems. While such regimes are not explicitly provided for in the NPT, we, nonetheless, see this activity as a necessary complement to our multilateral treaty obligations.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1910">I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 121, 130 and 144 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1911">The proposed agreement published by the Governments at St. Andrews comprehensively addressed the core issues standing in the way of the restoration of the power-sharing institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  It sets out a clear way forward for all parties to commit to the full operation of stable power-sharing government and the North/South and East/West arrangements and to full support for policing and the criminal justice institutions, including the Policing Board. It also sets out in some detail the practical changes proposed to the operation of the institutions, the arrangements for a financial package and the timetable for implementation of the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1912">The St. Andrews text is balanced and fair. It addresses the concerns of the parties on all outstanding issues. If implemented, it will bring us at last to the realisation of the Government's overriding priority — the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and fully-functioning power-sharing institutions serving the people of Northern Ireland.   We believe that all the parties wish to see devolution restored and that all parties wish to support policing and the rule of law. We have also made clear however, that our deadline for progress remains firm and that in the event of failure to agree, we will proceed on the basis of the new British Irish partnership arrangements to implement the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1913">We have asked the parties to confirm acceptance of the agreement by 10 November so that the timetable we have laid out for the nomination of the First and Deputy First Minister in November and for restoration of the Executive in March can be met. We continue to urge all the parties to work towards agreement on any outstanding issues and to remain steadfast in the face of those whose interests may lie in frustrating progress. The Government's firm view is that no issue is so difficult or intractable that it can not be resolved through discussion between the parties themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1914">This is also the case in respect of the future stability of the institutions. Paragraph 11 of the St. Andrews Agreement refers to the existing verification and compliance mechanisms relating to the Assembly as set out in the Good Friday Agreement and in the agreement between the Governments published in May 2003. Institutional stability is fundamentally linked to the overall question of trust and confidence. The St. Andrews Agreement is the culmination of the Governments' work over many years to create a process where trust and confidence grow incrementally to the point where partnership government becomes a lasting reality in Northern Ireland. We believe that implementation of the St. Andrews Agreement and the consequent commitment by all parties in good faith to share power and to support policing and the criminal justice system is the best possible guarantor of institutional stability into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1915">As the Taoiseach has said, it is clear from our discussions at St. Andrews that some form of electoral endorsement of the agreement as a whole will be required before the formation of an Executive. The form such an endorsement would take in Northern Ireland is not decided, nor is the question of whether a referendum might be required here. In considering these matters, the Government will obviously be guided by the considered advice of the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">The process will continue to demand careful management to bring it to a successful completion and the Government will continue to work in close partnership with the British Government, as well as with the parties, as we work to that end.</p>

            <p eId="para_1920">I propose to take Questions Nos. 103, 107 and 212 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1921">This year Ireland, through Irish Aid, has delivered significant development and humanitarian funding in the Middle East. The bulk of Ireland's assistance — over €7.5 million in 2006 — has been allocated to Palestine, Lebanon and Iraq. In addition, micro-project development support of €140,000 has also been provided in Syria and Jordan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1922">In 2006, we have allocated some €5.4 million to meet the humanitarian and development needs of the Palestinian people. Ireland's core objective in providing assistance to Palestine is to alleviate the consequences of the conflict, by enhancing the capacity of Ireland's partners in Palestine to respond to the current crisis and, where possible, to begin to meet the future development needs of the Palestinian people. Currently, funding is not provided directly to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1923">The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) remains our key partner in the provision of basic, emergency assistance to the Palestinian people. Ireland has provided €2 million in assistance to UNRWA this year. This core funding facilitates UNRWA in responding with flexibility to Palestinian needs in the West Bank, Gaza and also in the region, including refugees in Jordan, Syria and the Lebanon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1924">In Palestine, our development funding is focused on the provision of support for basic education, strengthening local government through local and rural development programmes and support for key United Nations agencies. In addition, Ireland has provided funding through partner NGOs and Bethlehem University.</p>
            <p eId="para_1925">Ireland responded swiftly to the crisis in Lebanon earlier this year. A total of €1.3 million was approved for delivery for humanitarian operations via key UN and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) with a proven record of delivering effective assistance on the ground. On 31 August, at the Stockholm Donor Conference, I pledged a further €2 million for recovery and longer-term reconstruction and assistance in Lebanon and Palestine over the next two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1926">The Financial Tracking Service system of the United Nations has reported that over US$362 million in humanitarian funding has been committed by donors in response to the emergency phase of the crisis in the Lebanon. At the recent Stockholm Conference in support of Lebanon, some US$900 million was pledged by donors in support of early recovery and rehabilitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1927">Ireland continues to respond to the humanitarian situation in Iraq and in 2006, funding of €850,000 has been provided in support of mine clearance and health programmes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1929">There has been public debate about which categories of assistance should properly be classified as Official Development Assistance or ODA. A recent report by the NGO Action Aid highlighted differences between what is regarded as ‘real aid' and ‘phantom aid'. The Joint European NGO report, entitled, EU aid: genuine leadership or misleading figures?, which was published a few months ago, also touched upon these themes. The latter report stated that, while official figures released earlier this year by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Commission indicated that Member States were indeed living up to their promises as regards the scaling-up of their official development assistance, almost one third of reported ODA in 2005 did not provide any new aid for developing countries. Rather, said the report, it was in fact accounted for by debt cancellation, foreign student costs and refugees in donor countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1930">The internationally agreed rules for aid reporting are set by the OECD. Some of the categories referred to by the Deputy may be eligible as development assistance, under OECD rules. It should be recalled that debt relief, for example, makes an important contribution to development. I should also point out that Ireland's development assistance consists almost entirely of funding in grant form to programmes and projects. Indeed, in the Action Aid report, referred to earlier, Ireland retained its position as the donor with the highest share of real aid.</p>

            <p eId="para_1932">The Treaty establishing the Energy community was signed on 25 October 2005 by the European Community and by Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Montenegro, Romania and Serbia as well as by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).  The Treaty follows on from the Athens process which started in 2002 when the European Commission set out proposals for the creation of a regional energy market in South East Europe. The Athens process and the Energy Community Treaty reflect the objectives of the Stabilisation and Association Process, which aims to promote cooperation between the European Union and the countries of the region. The Treaty also seeks to encourage cooperation among those counties themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1933">The Energy Community Treaty will allow the Balkan region to become integrated into the EU's internal energy market. Its key operational aims are to extend the application of the Community's <i>acquis</i> to all parties to the Treaty across a range of areas. It will create regional mechanisms to allow for closer integration of local energy markets. It represents agreement also to work towards common policies for external trade, mutual assistance and the removal of internal energy market barriers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">Turkey is currently engaged in negotiations on accession to the Energy Community Treaty. It has already signed the Athens Memorandum on which the Energy Community is based. This contains commitments at a political level for the establishment of and integrated regional energy market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">The Energy Community is a key element of the Union's strategy in South East Europe and is an important pre-accession tool for parties preparing to join the Union.

            <p eId="para_1939">I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 210 and 211 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1940">The IMF and World Bank have made increasing efforts to tackle the problem of debt in developing countries since the launch of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 1996. The HIPC Initiative, which was strengthened and enhanced in 1999, sought to reduce the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels but did not entail cancellation. Ireland contributed some €30m towards the costs of implementation of the Initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1941">The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), agreed by the G8 Countries at Gleneagles in July 2005 and which came into effect on 1 July this year, goes further. It is a commitment to the cancellation of the multilateral debt, owed to the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund, of many of the poorest and most indebted countries in the world. Most of these countries are in Africa. For the first time, the most powerful countries have recognised that many poor countries need 100% debt relief, if they are to address the development needs of their people seriously. This is an important basis from which we can continue to work for a complete and sustainable solution to the debt problem facing poor countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1942">The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative is separate from the earlier HIPC Initiative, but linked to it operationally. Under this new Initiative, cancellation of eligible debts is granted to countries which have completed the HIPC Initiative process, i.e. have already been judged as qualified to receive debt relief. As of mid-August 2006, 29 countries of the 40 defined heavily indebted poor countries had received debt relief under the HIPC Initiative amounting to US$28.8 billion. So far, 19 of these countries have also received MDRI debt relief from the IMF and World Bank amounting to a further US$15.8 billion (US$12.8 billion from the World Bank and US$3.0 billion from the IMF). The total cost of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative is estimated at US$48.9 billion in nominal terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1943">The IMF share of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative's costs will largely be met by own resources, as authorised by IMF Members including Ireland. Ireland's additional share of the costs of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative amounts to €58.6m, out of the approximately US$ 37 billion total cost of debt relief to be provided by the World Bank. As a gesture of support and to underline our strong commitment to 100% debt relief for the poorest countries, this amount has already been paid over in full.</p>

            <p eId="para_1947">I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 118 and 209 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1948">Negotiations regarding Turkish accession to the European Union commenced on 3 October 2005. An extensive screening process is currently ongoing which closely scrutinises the compatibility of Turkish legislation with that of the EU. In all, there are 35 negotiating chapters in the accession process. After a Chapter has been screened, the EU can decide, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, whether the negotiations in that sector can proceed. In June 2006, the European Council welcomed the provisional closure of the Science and Research chapter with Turkey. To date, this is the only Chapter to have been provisionally concluded. Very regular meetings take place at official level to examine and prepare the negotiating chapters in the accession process. Periodic meetings also take place at political level, the most recent being the EU Troika's meeting with Turkey's Foreign Minister, Mr. Abdullah Gul, which took place in Luxembourg on 16 October 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1949">A report on the progress of Turkey's accession negotiations is due to be published by the European Commission on 8 November 2006 and a debate on enlargement will take place at the November General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC). Turkey's Chief Negotiator with the EU, Mr. Ali Babacan, will visit Dublin on 2 November next when I will be meeting with him to review the negotiating process. He will also address the National Forum on Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1950">Ireland has always been supportive of the enlargement process from which we have consistently benefited. In approaching successive enlargement negotiations, it has been our policy to consider each candidate on the basis of its own merits. This principle will continue to underpin our approach to the negotiations with Turkey. While the negotiations with Turkey raise particularly difficult issues, it is important that the Union should abide by the commitments given to Turkey by successive European Councils. It is also essential that Turkey should fulfil its obligations, including the implementation of the Ankara Protocol.</p>
            <p eId="para_1951">Ireland has made it clear that, while we do not see Turkish recognition of the Republic of Cyprus as a condition for accession negotiations, it will be an absolute requirement for eventual Turkish membership of the Union. Meanwhile, it is vitally important that Turkey should normalise its relations with Cyprus as required by the Ankara Protocol.</p>

            <p eId="para_1955">I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 127 and 152 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1956">The Government shares the widespread concern at the extremely difficult situation in Iraq. We and our partners in the EU remain firmly committed to supporting the Iraqi people as they work to restore security and prosperity to their country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1957">On 21 May, the Iraqi Parliament approved the appointment of the national unity Government presented by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. The Cabinet includes democratically-elected representatives of all the main communities in Iraq, including the Sunni community. No-one would underestimate the huge challenges it faces in asserting its authority across the country. However, I believe it is important that we recognise that Iraq now has a fully sovereign and democratic Government and Parliament, for perhaps the first time in its history.</p>
            <p eId="para_1958">Since 2003, the EU has provided over €700 million in assistance for the reconstruction of Iraq. The June European Council emphasised that this support will continue, in partnership with the new Government. Work is continuing under the auspices of the United Nations on the development of an International Compact for Iraq, which would coordinate assistance in line with the Iraqi Government's priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1959">It is clear that the political and reconstruction efforts of the Government are to a great extent being blocked by the continuing large-scale violence across the country. There is at present no sign that the insurgency and the appalling inter-communal violence are being brought under control.</p>
            <p eId="para_1960">The Government has no means of assessing the accuracy of the different estimates of the numbers of casualties in Iraq. The NGO Iraq Body Count estimates that between 44,000 and 49,000 civilians have been reported killed since 2003. The recent article in the Lancet, by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the School of Medicine of Al Mustansiriya University in Baghdad, makes deeply disturbing reading. On the basis of a cluster sample survey, the researchers estimate that there may have been as many as 650,000 excess deaths in Iraq as a consequence of the war.</p>
            <p eId="para_1961">I have followed closely the recent public debate in Britain and in the US on the presence of international troops in Iraq, including the statements by the head of the British Army and by Prime Minister Blair. At the outset of the war in 2003, the Government acknowledged that there was no clear legal consensus on whether there was a mandate for the use of force against Iraq. The Taoiseach moved a Motion, which was adopted by the House on 20 March 2003, which reaffirmed Ireland's commitment to the United Nations as the guarantor of collective global security and the appropriate forum for the resolution of disputes threatening international peace and security. He made clear that Ireland could not participate in the military campaign without an explicit further Security Council mandate. This remains the Government's position on the circumstances of the invasion in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">The reality now is that the international forces serving in Iraq are operating at the explicit request of the Iraqi Government and under UN mandate. The presence of the Multinational Force was authorised by the UN Security Council under Resolution 1511 of October 2003, which urged Member States to contribute assistance under the UN mandate. This mandate was most recently extended until the end of 2006 by Resolution 1637, which was adopted unanimously by the Security Council last November. I believe it would be entirely inappropriate for the Government to advise other States on their contributions to a UN-mandated force. Moreover, it is above all for the democratically-elected Government of Iraq to consider whether it wishes the Multinational Force to continue its operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1963">The Government believes that in considering the situation in Iraq, the primary concern of the international community must be the welfare of the people of Iraq. They deserve a better future after decades of brutal dictatorship and war. Concerns relating to the vast reserves of natural resources with which their country has been blessed have too often contributed to instability and divisions in that region of the Middle East. Those resources now need to be harnessed in the interests of all the people of Iraq. The Government and our partners in the EU remain convinced that a secure and peaceful Iraq can only be ensured through the maintenance of its territorial integrity, the development of shared political and other institutions and strong political and economic links with all the countries of the neighbouring region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1966">I propose to take Questions No. 112 and 202 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1967">The Rapid Response Initiative, as set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid, is designed to enhance Ireland's response to humanitarian crises. The Initiative has three elements: (1) the pre-positioning and transportation of humanitarian supplies to disaster areas; (2) the availability of a roster of highly-skilled and experienced individuals, from both the public and private sectors, including the Defence Forces, for deployment at short notice to emergency situations; and (3) improving the emergency capacities of international humanitarian response agencies and mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">On Friday 13 October, I signed a Letter of Understanding with Mr. James Morris, Executive Director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP) on the pre-positioning of humanitarian supplies. Under the two-year pilot programme, Irish Aid will fund the pre-positioning of humanitarian supplies at the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) — the UN's rapid response base, managed by the WFP — in Brindisi, Italy. Further pre-positioned stocks will be located at the Curragh in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1969">The emergency supplies at Brindisi will comprise shelter and other non-perishable items such as kitchen sets, blankets, plastic sheeting, tents and mosquito nets and also water supply and sanitation equipment to benefit up to 20,000 people. Similar materials will be stored at the smaller facility in the Curragh. Ireland will also assist the UN in the expansion of its network of regional supply depots.</p>
            <p eId="para_1970">The second element of the Rapid Response Initiative, the establishment of a roster of individual volunteers available to assist in sudden emergencies, is currently in the planning phase. The roster will comprise a focused range of experts, recruited from both the public and private sectors, including the Defence Forces, who will be seconded, on request, to various UN organisations at short notice and for short periods in the early stages of a humanitarian response.</p>
            <p eId="para_1971">The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Food Programme (WFP) have been identified as appropriate partners in this regard. Irish Aid is currently in discussions with these UN humanitarian agencies in relation to the skill sets requirements for emergency missions. I expect that we will be able to enter into stand-by arrangements with these organisations in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">The third element of the Rapid Response Initiative is to provide assistance to key UN agencies, the Red Cross family and NGOs to enable them to enhance their own capacity to respond to humanitarian emergencies. This process is underway.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1980">I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 129, 215 and 216 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1981">The first round of voting in presidential and parliamentary elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) took place on 30 July, with an estimated turnout of just over 70%.  These were the first multi-party elections in the DRC in over forty years and took place in a generally peaceful environment. International observers, including the EU and the UN, have generally pronounced themselves satisfied that the elections were conducted in an open and fair manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1982">A run-off election between the two leading contenders in the presidential poll, President Kabila and Vice-President Bemba, will now take place on 29 October.</p>
            <p eId="para_1983">It is important that the electoral campaign leading up to the second round of voting on 29 October should be conducted in a orderly and peaceful manner and that there be no repetition of the violence which marred the announcement of the first round results on 21-22 August.  The EU, along with other international partners, played a major role in securing agreement on a code of conduct for the current electoral campaign which now needs to be fully respected and implemented.  It is also vital that all parties respect the democratic verdict of the electorate, once delivered, and that the emphasis in the post-election period should be on consensus building and ensuring the maximum political support for whatever new government emerges from the elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_1984">Ireland and its EU partners have invested heavily in support of the elections and the successful conclusion of the transition process in the DRC.  Nationally, Ireland has contributed a total of €1.3 million in support of the DRC electoral process.  Ireland is also contributing seven members of the Permanent Defence Forces who are serving with the EUFOR mission which the EU has deployed, at UN request, in order to provide support, if required, to the UN MONUC peace-keeping mission throughout the electoral period.  The EU also deployed a 250-strong election observation mission, including two observers from Ireland, to monitor the elections. Observers from this mission will be present for the second round voting on 29 October.</p>
            <p eId="para_1985">The DRC will continue to face considerable challenges in the post-election period and it will be important for the international community to remain engaged in support.  Greater progress needs to be made in tackling impunity and establishing an effective system of justice.  It is particularly important, in this regard, that the new government should fully support the ongoing investigation of the International Criminal Court into those serious crimes and human rights violations committed in the DRC since the Court's establishment on 1 July 2002.  One individual has already been indicted by the ICC and is currently in custody in The Hague awaiting trial.</p>
            <p eId="para_1986">Other priority areas for the new government, supported by the international community, will include ending the threat posed by illegal armed militias in eastern DRC as well as security sector reform and completing the integration of national armed and police forces.  The EU is already offering extensive support in this area though the EUSEC and EUPOL ESDP missions and has also agreed to coordinate international efforts in the future in support of security sector reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1987">The illegal exploitation of its considerable natural resources was a major contributory factor to the conflict in the DRC and it is important that the international community should work with the new government to ensure all necessary measures are taken to combat such illegal exploitation.  The issue of illegal exploitation of the DRC's natural resources was extensively studied by a UN Panel of Experts in 2002-2003 which made a number of practical recommendations for combating such exploitation.  The UN Security Council has, as yet, failed to take any action endorsing these recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1988">The illegal exploitation of its considerable natural resources was a major contributory factor to the conflict in the DRC and it is important that the international community should work with the new government to ensure all necessary measures are taken to combat such illegal exploitation.  The issue of illegal exploitation of the DRC's natural resources was extensively studied by a UN Panel of Experts in 2002-2003 which made a number of practical recommendations for combating such exploitation.  The UN Security Council has, as yet, failed to take any action endorsing these recommendations.  A positive development in this regard is the planned agreement on certification of natural resources which is likely to be approved by the eleven countries, including the DRC, participating within the framework of the UN and African Union-sponsored Great Lakes Conference, the second Summit of which is due to take place in Nairobi next December.  The successful holding of this Summit will itself be a major confidence-building measure and should contribute to underpinning security in the DRC and throughout the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">Given the scale of the conflict in the DRC, which is estimated to have resulted in at least 3.5 million deaths and has left three million people still internally displaced, it is evident that substantial support from the international community will be required in order to help confront the challenges of reconstruction which lay ahead.  The EU, through the European Development Fund, is committed to provide approximately €500 million in development and recovery assistance to the DRC for the period 2003-2007, of which over €150 will be committed this year.  This year's figure includes a substantial programme of rehabilitation amounting to €65 million in eastern DRC which continues to experience significant levels of insecurity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1990">The Government, for its part, has contributed almost €12 million for emergency and recovery activities in the DRC since 2003, with €6.1 million provided to date in 2006.  Ireland has also decided to provide financial support for the World Bank-administered Multi-Country Demobilisation and Rehabilitation Programme (MDRP) which spearheads international efforts to bring about demobilisation and rehabilitation of former combatants throughout the Great Lakes region.  Financial support from Ireland to the MDRP in 2006 will amount to €500,000. Ireland is committed to continuing to support the DRC, including through provision of emergency and recovery assistance as well as any other forms of assistance deemed appropriate, as that country moves into what I hope will be a new era of democracy and development.</p>

            <p eId="para_1992">At St. Andrews, the two Governments agreed proposals in relation to the few issues which remained outstanding from previous negotiations, including the restoration of power-sharing institutions and support for policing and the rule of law.  We believe that the St Andrews Agreement sets out clearly how these issues can be resolved with the necessary political will among the parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1993">In the St. Andrews Agreement, the Governments reiterated our consistent position that support for policing and the rule of law should be extended to every part of the community.  In our discussions, it was clear that all the parties, including Sinn Féin, share the objective of resolving the issue of policing.  The Agreement is unequivocal on what is required in this area: "Every party must fully endorse the PSNI and the criminal justice system; they must actively encourage everyone in the community to cooperate fully with the PSNI in tackling crime; and they must actively support all the policing and justice institutions, including the Policing Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1994">The Government, for its part, has taken every possible opportunity to encourage Sinn Féin to endorse the new policing arrangements, thereby ensuring that all communities in Northern Ireland are represented on the policing oversight institutions and have full access to the policing services provided by the PSNI.</p>
            <p eId="para_1995">Following the negotiations at St Andrews we have asked the parties to consult as appropriate, and to confirm their acceptance of the proposals by 10 November.  We continue to urge all the parties to work towards agreement on any outstanding issues and are firmly of the view that there now exists the basis for securing the objective of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_678">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1998">I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 126 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1999">The Taoiseach stated on 30 July that he was shocked and appalled at the heavy loss of life in the Israeli airstrike on the village of Qana.  He noted that this terrible event served to underline the Government's clear message that an immediate ceasefire was urgently needed in Lebanon and that military actions only made a solution more difficult.  The loss of innocent lives in Qana was also deplored by the UN Security Council on 30 July, and condemned across the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_2000">From the beginning of the conflict in Lebanon, which erupted following an unprovoked attack by Hizbollah on 12 July, the Government called unambiguously for an immediate cessation of violence and the protection of civilian lives.  Throughout the conflict we fully acknowledged that Israel had a right to defend itself against attack, but not at the expense of the rights, and the lives, of Lebanese civilians.  Our principal concern was with the effect of military actions on civilians, Israeli and Lebanese.  We were shocked at the high level of casualties among Lebanese civilians, and at the widespread destruction of vital civilian infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2001">We raised our concerns directly with the Israeli authorities throughout the conflict, and used every opportunity to influence the parties most directly involved.  On 26 July, with my colleague the Minister for Defence, I called in the Ambassador of Israel to emphasise the strength of the Government's position following the deaths of four unarmed UN peacekeepers in Khiam in Southern Lebanon.  We also worked consistently with our partners in the EU and at the UN to achieve a ceasefire.</p>
            <p eId="para_2002">I represented the Government's views strongly at two emergency meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council during August.  Ireland's contribution helped to ensure that the EU, at our meeting on 1 August, issued an unequivocal call for an immediate cessation of hostilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2003">The Government is strongly committed to assisting the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which was adopted unanimously on 11 August, and which provided the basis on which the fighting was brought to a halt.  It offers a path to a stable peace based on the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon.  The ceasefire is holding well and the EU has taken the lead in the deployment of the strengthened UNIFIL force in Southern Lebanon alongside units of the Lebanese Army, which has enabled the withdrawal of the Israeli Army from the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2004">As Deputies will be aware, following the decision of the Government and the approval of the Dail on 11 October, Ireland will contribute a contingent of 150 members of the Defence Forces to serve with UNIFIL, as part of a joint Finnish-Irish unit.  Deployment will take place at the end of this month.  The unit will carry out tasks in support of UNIFIL, and also humanitarian work, especially in relation to the clearance of unexploded ordnance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2005">The Government remains seriously concerned at the terrible risk posed to the civilian population in Southern Lebanon by the large number of unexploded cluster munitions.  We have supported the UN in its criticism of the Israeli Army in this regard.  Ireland is also one of a small group of States which is active internationally, in the context of the Review Conference of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, in calling for agreement on the opening of negotiations for a legally binding international instrument to address the humanitarian concerns posed by cluster munitions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2006">The events of this summer underlined that there can be no unilateral or military solution to the interrelated problems of the Middle East.  With our partners in the EU, we will remain engaged in support of the reconstruction of Lebanon, and of a plan for a comprehensive settlement in the region.  The EU will continue to give every possible support to the democratically-elected Government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora.  The Government will ensure that Ireland also continues to respond effectively to the humanitarian needs of the Lebanese people.  During the crisis, we committed a total of €2 million in immediate emergency humanitarian assistance to Lebanon and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  We have also pledged a further €2 million for longer term reconstruction and assistance over the coming two years.</p>

I received the US Government's report of the incident at the beginning of July.  While the report is subject to the normal rules of confidentiality that apply to communications between Diplomatic Missions and Foreign Ministries, I can confirm that the report provided a detailed description of the events that led to the incident in question, identified an apparent lapse in standard procedures and indicated that the US Embassy was evaluating possible remedial action and a readiness to work with the relevant authorities here to this end.</p>
            <p eId="para_2009">Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs have discussed arrangements at Shannon with officials from the US Embassy at several meetings since the report was received.  I understand that the US Embassy has taken steps aimed at preventing any recurrence of this type of incident and at ensuring that all relevant personnel are fully aware of their obligations and of the procedures to be followed.  On the basis of our discussions with the US authorities, I have no reason to believe that this was other than an isolated incident which arose from an administrative error.</p>

            <p eId="para_2013">I propose to take Questions Nos. 123, 145 and 208 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2014">As Deputies will be aware, the Government decided yesterday that Ireland would avail of the transitional arrangements with regard to labour market access which are provided for in the EU's Accession Treaty with Bulgaria and Romania.  This means that citizens of Bulgaria and Romania will continue to require work permits in order to take up employment here after the two countries accede to the EU in January next.</p>
            <p eId="para_2015">This decision was taken on the basis of careful consideration of all the issues involved and following consultations with the social partners.  We also had extensive contact with other Member States to determine their intentions with regard to labour market access for citizens of Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
            <p eId="para_2016">Among the Union's pre-2004 members, only Finland — which holds the EU Presidency — has announced that it will allow unrestricted labour market access from the date of accession.  Others have indicated that they will impose restrictions and indeed a number of key countries have yet to open up their labour markets to those Member States that acceded in 2004.  The British Government, which did not impose any restrictions in 2004, has decided on this occasion to apply a work permit requirement.  This British decision was an important consideration in our analysis of the options for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">On the occasion of the last EU enlargement in 2004, Ireland was one of only three of Member States not to restrict labour market access for citizens of the eight acceding States from Central and Eastern Europe.  As a result of this decision, a very large number of people from those countries have come to work here during the past two years.  Indeed, Ireland has attracted a disproportionately large number of migrant workers compared with the other two EU countries that opened their labour markets in 2004.  For example, we have taken in almost half as many workers as the UK, which has a population 15 times greater than ours.</p>
            <p eId="para_2018">Against this backdrop, and in the light of the intentions of our EU partners, our decision to continue to require work permits for Bulgarians and Romanians was the prudent and proper course of action to take in this instance.  It means that workers from Bulgaria and Romania will be able to come here when they fill a genuine labour market need.</p>

We reaffirmed the commitment of the two Governments to the effect that nuclear power stations will not be built on the island of Ireland. In this context, we agreed to work together to maximise the contribution of renewable and sustainable energy to the future needs of the island.</p>

Our views in this regard have been expressed strongly and repeatedly, including at the British-Irish Council Summit in London on 2 June this year which I attended with my colleague, Mr. Dick Roche T.D., the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. At that meeting we emphasised the Government's concerns about Sellafield and nuclear safety generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_2023">The fight against trafficking in human beings is a matter of urgent concern at EU and international level. At the June European Council this year, Heads of State and Government identified this issue as a priority where further action is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2024">A wide ranging action plan to deal with trafficking in human beings was adopted at the December 2005 European Council. Implementation of this plan, which covers areas such as the coordination of EU action, the prevention of trafficking and the prosecution of offences linked to trafficking, is being pursued through the Justice and Home Affairs Council where Ireland is represented by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_2025">Human trafficking is also addressed in other international fora, including the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), where Ireland works closely with its EU Partners. A Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings was agreed last year and opened for signature in Warsaw on 16 May 2005. An action plan on human trafficking was endorsed by the OSCE in December 2003. Ireland is also a signatory to the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime and its two accompanying protocols on smuggling and on prevention, suppression and punishment of human trafficking. Human trafficking is, of course, primarily a criminal law matter and my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is preparing legislation which will criminalise trafficking for the purpose of sexual and labour exploitation in Ireland. Ireland has also, through Irish Aid, contributed over €1.7 million towards anti-trafficking projects carried out by, amongst others, the International Labour Organisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2027">The European Commission's final monitoring report on the state of Romania's preparedness for EU membership was released on 26 September. The report gives the European Commission's assessment on Romania's progress since May 2006. It confirms that they have made further progress with their preparations for membership and that they will be ready to join the European Union on 1 January 2007. However, the Commission's report also identifies a number of areas of continuing concern and makes it clear that it may take measures to ensure the proper functioning of the Union unless appropriate corrective action is taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_2028">The further monitoring envisaged in the Commission's report will serve to ensure that the pace of reform in Romania is maintained following its accession. In particular the Commission has set a number of benchmarks in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption, money-laundering and organised crime where some progress has been made but further tangible results are needed. Other areas which have been identified for further scrutiny are the proper management of EU agricultural funds and food safety. Romania has been strongly encouraged to make proper use of the months before accession in order to address the remaining issues. The entry of Bulgaria and Romania into the EU will complete the Union's 5th enlargement that was made possible by the ending of the Cold War. Ireland looks forward to working with both countries in making a success of the enlarged Union of 27 members.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2031">I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 137 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2032">The Government remains deeply concerned at the continuing crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The situation in Gaza in particular is unsustainable. The events of recent months have confirmed again that there are no military or unilateral solutions to the interlinked problems of the Middle East. The Government and our partners in the EU are committed to the promotion of a comprehensive settlement, with a negotiated two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at its core. I stated in my address to the UN General Assembly on 26 September that such a settlement is more urgently required now than at any time in the past 60 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2033">The Government has consistently been active, directly with the parties, with our partners in the EU and at the UN in encouraging the negotiation of a lasting, just and peaceful settlement based on the co-existence of two sovereign and independent States, Israel and Palestine. The EU has taken the lead under the Oslo Process, since 1993, in supporting the establishment of the institutions of a future Palestinian State. The EU continues to impress on both Israel and the Palestinian Authority the urgency of meeting their obligations under the Quartet Roadmap and under international law. In this regard, it is essential that Israel end the building of settlements, the construction of the separation barrier on occupied land and all activities which threaten to undermine the viability of a two-State solution. We have stated very clearly that the EU will not recognise any change to the pre-1967 borders unless they have been agreed between the parties. My officials and I have consistently conveyed these views in contacts with the Israeli Government, and will continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_2034">Following the democratic Palestinian elections in January, the EU and the international Quartet outlined clearly the principles under which the international community can engage with the Palestinian Government. I deeply regret that, to date, the Hamas Government which was appointed in March, has not yet committed itself unambiguously to the peace process. The EU has strongly supported the recent courageous efforts by President Mahmoud Abbas to negotiate the formation of a Palestinian Government of national unity, committed to the negotiation of a two-State solution. The process has proved extremely difficult, and has been undermined by the violence in the Occupied Territories since June and by the recent clashes between different armed Palestinian groups. I have stated, however, that if President Abbas is successful in forming a national unity Government based clearly on his platform for peace and reflecting the Quartet principles, Ireland will argue strongly for a positive and creative political response by the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_2035">Deputies will be aware that since April the Commission has suspended direct assistance to the Government of the Palestinian Authority. However, the EU has taken the lead in the establishment of the Temporary International Mechanism to channel assistance directly to the Palestinian people. The Mechanism has been in operation since July, and the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg on 17 October welcomed the expansion of its remit, and its extension until December 2006. The Mechanism has focused on essential assistance in the health sector, the provision of fuel, and support for the large number of Palestinian families depending on low incomes. In fact, and contrary to what is widely believed, EU assistance to the Palestinians has increased significantly this year. To date in 2006, the EU has provided a total of €650 million in urgently needed assistance. Community assistance has risen to €330 million so far, about one third higher than the annual total in recent years. Ireland's bilateral assistance to the Palestinian people will increase by some 25% this year, to €5.4 million and the Government remains ready to respond further as necessary. The withholding by Israel of over €450 million in tax and customs revenues since April is the principal factor in the financial crisis facing the Authority. The EU has repeatedly called on Israel to resume transfers to the Palestinian Authority, if necessary through the Mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_2036">The immediate priority now must be to end the humanitarian and security crisis in Gaza. We have called clearly for an end to violence from all sources and the release of the captured Israeli soldier and the detained Palestinian legislators. The closure of Gaza must also be ended, through the re-opening of border crossing points for people and for goods. The EU is ready to play its part on the ground, including through the EU Border Assistance Mission at Rafah. The EU will also continue to press for an early and substantive meeting between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas, with a view to the re-establishment of a credible political process based on the essentials of the Quartet Roadmap.</p>

            <p eId="para_2040">The situation to which the Deputy refers concerns an ongoing state of unrest in Oaxaca in southern Mexico. In May 2006, an initially peaceful teachers' pay-related strike developed into an increasingly violent and politicised protest, with protesters forming the Asamblea Popular de los Pueblos de Oaxaca (APPO, or the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca). APPO took control of the centre of the city, as well as the local radio and television station, bringing the state government to a virtual standstill within the city. APPO has stated that it will only agree to negotiations aimed at ending the protest and reopening the state's 14,000 schools if the democratically elected state governor, Ulises Ruiz, is removed from power. At least five people are known to have been killed during the course of the protests.</p>
            <p eId="para_2041">The Mexican Government has been making intensive efforts to resolve peacefully the situation in Oaxaca. Most recently, on 10 October, lengthy negotiations were held in Mexico City between representatives of the government, teachers' union and APPO, at which it was agreed that the state and municipal police could resume their patrols in Oaxaca city under federal command. The teachers' representatives also agreed to consult regarding the reopening of schools, halting their strike and ending the occupation of the city centre. However, the subsequent rejection of these agreements by the protesters on 11 October sparked a fresh wave of violence, forcing the postponement of an assessment visit by the Mexican Senate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2042">I am satisfied that the Mexican Government is working to bring about a peaceful and democratic end to the state of unrest, with incumbent President Vicente Fox highlighting the resolution of the dispute as one of his priorities before the completion of his term in office on 1 December. Ireland, along with our European Union partners, monitors and regularly discusses with the Mexican authorities the human rights situation in Mexico and the fulfilment of their obligations under international law. I have asked our Embassy in Mexico to keep the situation under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_2044">The relationship between Cyprus and Turkey is fraught with a number of problems stemming from the division of the island between the internationally-recognised Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish controlled northern part. EU membership conferred a range of economic benefits on the Republic of Cyprus. Finding a solution to Cyprus's political problem would allow these benefits to be extended to all the people of the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_2045">Following the referendums of 24 April 2004 on the UN Secretary General's proposals for a comprehensive settlement, the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) agreed on the need to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by fostering their economic advancement. At its meeting on 27 February last, the Council adopted a regulation establishing a financial support instrument under which a total of €139 million will be made available to the Turkish Cypriot community in 2006 for the purpose of facilitating the integration of the island and promoting contact between the two communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2046">The June 2006 European Council recalled the need for Turkey to fulfil its obligations under the Association Agreement and its Additional Protocol, which takes account of the accession of the new Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus. Turkey's progress in fulfilling these obligations, which include the need to recognise the economic, maritime and navigational rights of all EU Member States will be evaluated by the European Commission in a report that is due to be published on 8 November. The Finnish Presidency is working on an initiative aimed at resolving the question of access to Turkish ports for Cypriot vessels in compliance with the Ankara Protocol. We fully support these efforts by the Presidency and hope that they will lead to a solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2047">The United Nations has the lead role in the search for a comprehensive settlement. The EU and its Member States recognise the importance of supporting the efforts of the UN Secretary General and are agreed that a just and lasting settlement would contribute to peace and stability in the region. Our shared objective is an agreed, comprehensive settlement, which will enable the people of Cyprus to live together as citizens of a united Cyprus in the European Union.</p>

            <p eId="para_2049">Chinese Vice-Premier Zeng Peiyan paid an official visit to Ireland from 24-26 September.  The Vice-Premier held official talks with the Tánaiste and paid courtesy calls on the President and the Taoiseach.  The Minister for Education and Science, Ms. Mary Hanafin T.D., hosted an official dinner for the Vice-Premier and a business breakfast was hosted for him by the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, Mr. Micheál Martin T.D., in co-operation with Enterprise Ireland.  The key objective of the visit was to build on the close and developing relationship between Ireland and China.</p>
            <p eId="para_2050">The official talks held with the Tánaiste on 25 September enabled a detailed exchange of views on a wide range of bilateral, regional and international issues and provided an opportunity to discuss practical ways to further pursue our mutual interests.  The discussion covered expanding trade and investment and strengthening cooperation at all levels, in particular practical co-operation in areas such as education, agriculture, science and technology and research with a particular focus on software development and bio-engineering.</p>
            <p eId="para_2051">The meeting also afforded an opportunity for the Tánaiste to raise human rights concerns with the Vice-Premier.  Human rights issues are a constant and important point of dialogue with the Chinese authorities at both bilateral and European Union (EU) levels.  For my part, I took the opportunity to raise human rights issues and concerns, including the importance we attach to freedom of speech and religion, when I met with Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr. Li Zhaoxing, during a visit to Beijing in May.  Foreign Minister Li referred in particular to China's commitment to the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue and was hopeful that a decision would be taken to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2052">The EU-China Human Rights Dialogue is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises human rights issues and concerns with China. The latest round of the Dialogue was held in Beijing on 19 October.</p>
            <p eId="para_2053">Senior officials from both sides discussed a wide range of human rights issues.  Special attention was given to questions related to combating racism, freedom of expression and reform of the criminal justice system in China.  The EU took note of the commitment of China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as soon as possible and, in that context, to reform its criminal justice system.  The EU urged China to continue co-operation with, and implementation of the recommendations of, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, including the rapid abolition of the "re-education through labour" system.  The EU expressed its deep concern over the continuing restrictions on freedom of expression in China, including on the use of the internet.  The EU further expressed concern at the high number of human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists in prison and urged China not to harass or punish individuals exercising their right to freedom of expression in a peaceful manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2054">Other subjects discussed included the recent incident on China's border with Nepal, where Chinese soldiers opened fire towards a group of Tibetans attempting to cross the border.  The EU side asked for clarification and urged China to investigate the incident thoroughly.</p>

            <p eId="para_2061">The European Commission's final monitoring report on the state of preparedness for EU membership of Bulgaria and Romania was released on 26 September.  The report gives the European Commission's assessment of their progress since May 2006.  It confirms that they will be ready to join the European Union on 1 January 2007.  However, the Commission's report also identifies a number of areas of continuing concern and makes plain its willingness to take the necessary measures to ensure the proper functioning of the Union following their accession.</p>
            <p eId="para_2062">The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) meeting in Luxembourg on 17 October 2006 concluded that Bulgaria and Romania will be in a position to take on the obligations of membership on 1 January 2007.  The Council commended both countries on the reforms they have undertaken in preparation for membership.  The Council also underlined the importance of continued political commitment by both countries to address the outstanding issues identified in the Commission's report.  The Enlargement Working Group, which meets regularly in Brussels, will continue to monitor the two countries' preparedness for membership.</p>
            <p eId="para_2063">Throughout this process, Ireland has fully supported the Commission in its efforts to ensure full compliance with the requirements of membership.  We have urged both countries to make full use of the period prior to accession in order to deal with the problem areas highlighted by the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_2064">We have also sought to provide practical support to both countries in their preparations for membership.  Bulgaria and Romania currently benefit from the Department of Foreign Affairs' Accession Training Programme and can continue to do so for a period following their accession.  There is already a programme in place dedicated to capacity-building in public administration in both countries and we are currently developing a programme to promote transparency in recruitment and promotion in the Bulgarian public sector.</p>

The report gives the European Commission's assessment on Bulgaria's progress since May 2006.  It confirms that their preparations for membership have advanced further and that Bulgaria will be ready to join the European Union on 1 January 2007.  However, the Commission's report also identifies a number of areas of continuing concern and makes plain its willingness to take the necessary measures to ensure the proper functioning of the Union if appropriate corrective action is not taken by Bulgaria.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">The further monitoring envisaged in the Commission's report will serve to ensure that the pace of reform in Bulgaria is maintained following its accession.  In particular, the Commission has set a number of benchmarks in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption, money-laundering and organised crime.  These are areas where some progress has been made, but where further efforts and tangible results are needed.  Other areas of concern highlighted by the Commission are the proper management of EU agricultural funds, food safety and aviation.  Bulgaria has been strongly encouraged to make proper use of the months before accession in order to address the remaining issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">The entry of Bulgaria and Romania into the EU on 1 January 2007 will complete the Union's 5 Enlargement made possible by the ending of the Cold War.  Ireland looks forward to working with both countries in making a success of the enlarged Union of 27 members.</p>

            <p eId="para_2078">I very much welcome the opportunity presented by my recent visit to New York on the occasion of the United Nations General Assembly to also meet with representatives of the Irish community. As the Deputy will be aware, the welfare of the undocumented Irish in the US is a matter of deep concern to the Government and one which I raise in all of my dealings with key figures there.</p>
            <p eId="para_2079">On 27th September, I had a very valuable meeting with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform (ILIR), an organisation that very effectively represents the views of the undocumented Irish, and which the Government has been happy to support financially. I have met with representatives of ILIR on a number of occasions, both in the US and in Ireland, and know that they very much appreciate the interest of the Government and the Oireachtas in their work. During our recent meeting in New York, they provided me with an update on their campaign. We also exchanged views on developments in the immigration reform debate and on the prospects for the undocumented Irish. I reiterated to them that my efforts on behalf of the undocumented Irish will continue to be an area of the highest priority in the period ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_2080">I was also happy to meet again with representatives of Irish Immigration Centres and the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres. The information and advisory services that these centres offer are of great benefit to the more vulnerable members of our community in the US, including the undocumented Irish. Earlier this year I was happy to announce grants totalling US$1.183 million to these centres, an increase of 29% on last year's funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">In the period ahead, the Government will continue to strongly support measures that would enable the undocumented to regularise their status and have open to them a path to permanent residency. In this regard, we warmly appreciate the firm commitment to a comprehensive solution that Senator Kennedy, Senator McCain and others continue to pursue.</p>

            <p eId="para_2086">The Explosives Act, 1875, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 2006, governs the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks and under the Act fireworks may only be imported into the country on foot of an importation licence granted by me.  It is current policy, in the interests of public safety and security, to restrict, to the greatest extent possible, the availability of fireworks to the general public.  Consequently, licences are only issued for the importation of fireworks for use in organised displays, conducted by "professional/competent operators".  Licences are not issued for the importation of fireworks for sale to the general public.  Last year I commissioned research into the public's attitude to current policy on the control of fireworks and the general conclusion of the research was that the public are generally in favour of the thrust of current policy.  I believe that our current policy strikes the right balance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">Conscious of the difficulties which the illegal use of fireworks present each year around this time and the distress they cause to people, particularly the elderly, I introduced, in the Criminal Justice Act, 2006, a number of amendments to the 1875 Act which provide for new offences, governing the illegal possession and use of fireworks, and increased penalties.  Under these new provisions it is an offence:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2088">to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2089">to throw an ignited firework at any person or property, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2090">to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">The penalty for such offences is a fine of up to €2,500 or 6 months imprisonment or both on summary conviction or a fine of up to €10,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both on conviction on indictment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">The simple possession of fireworks without a licence is also an offence for which a person may be liable to a fine of up to €10,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">A Directive on control of fireworks is currently being debated in the EU.  The objective of the Directive is to establish rules designed to achieve the free movement of pyrotechnic articles/fireworks throughout EU Member States while, at the same time, ensuring a high degree of protection for the consumer.  When the Directive is finalised, all fireworks imported into or manufactured or sold within EU Member States, will be required to comply with certain essential minimum safety standards.  While the Directive will allow the free movement, within the EU Member States, of low hazard fireworks, (such as sparklers and party poppers), it will not preclude Member States from taking measures, which are justified on the grounds of public safety, security or public order, to prohibit or restrict the possession, use or sale to the general public of more hazardous and powerful fireworks.</p>

            <p eId="para_2120">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_2121">I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that under Operation ‘Assist', personnel from Organisational Support Unit, including the Garda Mounted Unit and the Garda Dog Unit, have been supplementing local Garda personnel in conducting daily patrols of the Moyross estates of Limerick City since the beginning of October. The patrols are generally of an eight-hour duration and are usually from late evening until the early hours of the following morning. The patrols are dependent on requirements and issues arising in the general Moyross area and are at the discretion of local Garda management.</p>
            <p eId="para_2122">Garda management state that the Garda Dog Units and Mounted Units are conducting these patrols from Mayorstone Garda Station and have provided excellent assistance to local Garda personnel in the policing of the areas in question.</p>

These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.

The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2433">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not have information on the numbers of flight movements into and out of Cork, Dublin or Shannon Airports going back to 2002.  Such information is the property of the Airport Authority rather than the Revenue Commissioners.  It has not been possible to get the same level of detail on flight movements from the relevant authority for each airport, with the result that some numbers in the response are estimated.  Since 1993 intra-Community travellers of EU countries have had the right of free movement within the EU.  Customs authorities are not permitted to impose systematic checks on travellers whose point of origin is within the EU.  In effect, intra-Community flights have been regarded as domestic since 1993.  Customs authorities can impose selective checks for prohibited or restricted goods, but only on the basis of "reasonable grounds for suspicion".  Flights from non-EU countries are of course subject to checking at the discretion of the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2434">Customs experience has shown that flights and types of passenger can be risk-rated quite accurately, and checking is now mainly risk driven.  In addition to risk driven checks, random checks are sometimes performed to validate the risk assessment. Anti-smuggling checks are targeted, and are carried out by rostered staff or by on-call non-rostered staff depending on the availability of rostered staff, and on the number of officers required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2435">Dublin</p>
            <p eId="para_2436">Throughout the period in question Revenue has had, and continues to have, officers rostered on a 24/7 basis in Dublin Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_2437">Shannon</p>
            <p eId="para_2438">Up to the end of 2004, staff were rostered on a 24-hour basis and all flights were attended.  A review of the risk associated with late-night flights however prompted a change in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2439">Since that change in 2005 there have been in general 17 flights per week outside of hours when rostered staff were on duty.  However those flights are monitored and checked as appropriate by non-rostered officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2440">Cork</p>
            <p eId="para_2441">All scheduled flights to Cork originate within the EU and are relatively low risk.  These are monitored and attended by non-rostered officers as required. There are 15 scheduled flights per week Monday to Friday (3 per day x 5 days) that arrive during hours that officers are not rostered.  They are also monitored and attended by non-rostered officers on a risk-management basis. Officers are rostered at weekends for a total of 16 rostered hours.  These rosters vary from weekend to weekend, depending on flight movements and profiling of those flights.  The officers are rostered to attend at the times of highest risk.  Given the high level of activity at weekends it is estimated that approximately 40 flights per weekend arrive during hours that officers are not rostered for attendance.  As with all flights these are profiled and a proportion attended by non-rostered officers.</p>

            <p eId="para_2445">Making healthy and nourishing food choices easily accessible to older people in residential care can help reduce the incidence of poor nutrition, under-nutrition or over-nutrition.  My Department has drawn up an outline proposal for food served in health care Facilities, as part of the implementation of key Departmental strategies: the National Health Promotion Strategy and Quality and Fairness — A Health System for You</p>
            <p eId="para_2446">This proposal includes residential care for older people and is being delivered in 3 phases:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2447">Phase 1: The Healthy Catering Guidelines for Staff and Visitors in Healthcare Facilities.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2448">These guidelines, which will benefit staff and visitors in all Healthcare facilities, were published in 2005. An achievement award scheme to encourage and assist Healthcare Facilities wishing to adopt and evaluate the implementation of these guidelines, was launched in June 2006 and is being coordinated by the Health Promoting Hospitals Network.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2449">Phase 2: Guidelines for Preventing Under-Nutrition in Acute Hospitals.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2450">These guidelines will benefit all patients in Acute Hospitals.  These guidelines, which will be available later this year, have been developed with the Irish Nutrition &amp; Dietetic Institute, the Catering Managers Association and Health Promoting Hospitals Network. An achievement award scheme to assist Healthcare Facilities in adopting these guidelines is also planned.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2451">Phase 3: Guidelines for Food and Nutrition in Long-Stay Healthcare Facilities.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2452">These guidelines will benefit all those in long-term care, including residential care for older people. The guidelines will be developed by an expert group of stakeholders in 2007. The Guidelines for Preventing Under-Nutrition in Acute Hospitals will serve as a starting point for these and will include other nutrition problems for older people, such as inappropriate over-nutrition. An achievement award scheme is also envisaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2453">Furthermore, improving nutrition for older people has been addressed by providing some dedicated community dietetic posts through home-care packages; the essence of care programmes, which now include nutrition as a key component; and pilot projects, such as the person centred project in the HSE Midland area, of which nutrition is a key component.</p>

            <p eId="para_2469">As the Deputy may be aware in 2002, the then Minister for Education and Science introduced the Residential Institutions Redress Act.  This legislation was enacted to provide a mechanism for former residents of industrial schools, reformatories, orphanages, children's homes and in certain situations special schools and hospitals to obtain redress for injuries they suffered while so resident.</p>
            <p eId="para_2470">The rationale behind the setting up of the Redress Board was that children in the residential institutions were separated from their parents and, therefore, did not have the benefit of the care and protection which a child in the care of a family usually enjoys. The institutions concerned controlled all aspects of the children's lives 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with no reasonable capacity for access to or involvement by their parents. Therefore, the children in the institutions relied to a significant degree on the public bodies that had a statutory duty to protect them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2471">During the passage of the legislation through both Houses the issue of including children who were in foster care was discussed and it was decided not to extend the legislation, as children in foster care were not in a residential institution.  It is not the intention currently to establish a redress board dealing with foster care.  However, I wish to assure you that I am committed to ensuring that children placed in foster care receive the highest standard of care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2472">I am aware of correspondence from 3 individuals in recent times seeking the establishment of such a redress board and I have responded to these individuals in this regard.  It is, of course, open to any individual to pursue their own redress through the courts system should they wish.</p>

            <p eId="para_2480">As hospital doctors do not have General Medical Services contracts, prescriptions written by them for medical card holders are not reimbursable under the GMS scheme.  Such prescriptions must be transcribed by the patient's GMS-contracted general practitioner to a GMS form.  The prescription can then be dispensed by a pharmacy that holds a community pharmacy contract.  Under emergency dispensing arrangements, GMS patients can obtain a short term supply of a hospital prescription from a community pharmacy, where it would not be possible or practical to contact their GP within a reasonable period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2481">This administrative arrangement provides for greater auditability and security within the GMS scheme.  It also proves worthwhile because GMS patients have greater contact with their general practitioner after leaving hospital, establishing a valuable link between primary and secondary care services that might otherwise be less frequent.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2501">As the Deputy may be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993  provide for the payment of subvention for private nursing home care for applicants who qualify on both medical and means grounds.  General rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for nursing home subvention are set out in the Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993, as amended by the 2005 Regulations.  There are currently three rates of subvention payable, i.e. €114.30, €152.40 and €190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum and these rates apply in all parts of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2502">The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted.  The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 2004.  The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. The supports paid by the HSE vary from person to person and region to region, depending on nursing home fees for example.</p>
            <p eId="para_2503">Additional funding of €20 million was provided for the administration of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme in 2006. The additional €20 million is to support more basic nursing home subventions and reduce waiting lists for enhanced subventions: it is also to bring more consistency to subventions support throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2504">The Health (Nursing Homes)(Amendment) Bill 2006 is designed to ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing home care is grounded in primary legislation and to help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis across the country. In addition, national guidelines on nursing home subvention are currently being developed by the HSE to ensure an even and equitable application of the regulations nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2505">The Government is currently considering new policy on Long Term Care and several principles underlying this were agreed with the social partners in "Towards 2016". These principles include, for example, that there should be one standardised national needs assessment for older people needing care.  The use of community and home-based care should be maximised.  Sheltered housing options will be encouraged.  Where residential care is required, it should be quality care and there should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  The level of support for residential care should be indifferent as to whether that care is in a public or private facility. The financial model to support any new arrangements must also be financially sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2506">The Department is currently drawing up proposals as agreed with the social partners in "Towards 2016".</p>

            <p eId="para_2508">The FÁS "Healthcare Skills Monitoring Report" (2005) provided a quantitative analysis of demand and supply in 21 health care occupations including Chiropody/Podiatry.  It highlighted podiatry as among those professions where current and future supply shortages should be addressed and recommended that a School of Podiatry providing 20 to 30 places be established.  Meetings are continuing at an official level between my Department, the Department of Education and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Health Service Executive to progress the matter.  Responsibility for its establishment will be a matter, in the final instance, for the Department of Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_2509">There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements are made to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_2510">I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.   My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service. This process has been under way for some time and considerable progress has been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2511">My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_2513">The Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources maintains a watching scientific brief on health issues relating to non–ionising radiation including those related to mobile phones. The limits for emissions from mobile telephone masts (non-ionising radiation) are global limits established internationally by the International Commission for Non Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). My Department is advised that there is currently no scientific medical evidence that emissions from mobile telephone masts, which comply with the levels outlined in the ICNIRP Guidelines, are injurious to health.</p>
            <p eId="para_2514">These guidelines are set at levels which are many times less than the experimental levels at which no adverse effects have been established. Ireland has adopted the guidelines established by ICNIRP. All licensed telecommunications operators in Ireland are required by the terms of their licences to observe international guidelines on the limits of emissions from telecommunications masts. Compliance with these guidelines is a matter for the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>
            <p eId="para_2515">The Government approved the establishment of an inter-Departmental committee on the health effects of electromagnetic fields in September 2005.

This committee has overseen the establishment of an expert group on the health effects of electromagnetic fields, which has undertaken a thorough review of the latest scientific reports and will report to the inter-departmental committee on the current scientific consensus and science-based policy. The inter-Departmental committee expects to report to Government later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2520">Section 16 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (the Act) prescribes that a person shall not construct or reconstruct a generating station unless an authorisation has been granted by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).</p>
            <p eId="para_2521">The conditions under which the CER may grant or refuse to grant a license to generate electricity are prescribed out in Section 14 (1) of the Act, as amended by sections 32 and 16 of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2000 and 2005 respectively (SI 445 of 2000 and SI 60 of 2005).</p>
            <p eId="para_2522">I am advised that under the existing application process, applicants must provide certain information to the CER as set out in the application forms and guidance notes published on the CER's website. This process provides that applications regarding generating stations below 5 MW need not be accompanied by the same financial information as those above 5MW.</p>
            <p eId="para_2523">This reduced information requirement is in line with Section 17 (2B) of the Act as inserted by Regulation 14 (c) of SI 60 of 2005, which requires that the CER ensures that authorisation procedures for small generators and distributed generation take into account their limited size and potential impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_2524">Applications for an authorisation are assessed under the criteria stated in SI 309 of 1999 (Electricity Regulation Act (Criteria for Determination of Authorisations) Order, 1999). Following the amendments to the Act arising from SI 60 of 2005, the CER may now licence the generation of electricity and authorise the construction or reconstruction of a class or classes of generating stations by way of Order. As outlined in Sections 16(3A) and 14(1A) of the Act, the construction or reconstruction and the generation of electricity from such generating stations will be subject to the terms and conditions as may be specified in the relevant Order.</p>
            <p eId="para_2525">I am advised that the CER is currently reviewing the process for the granting of authorisations and licenses. It is holding a public consultation in this regard and has published a consultation paper on its website at <i>http://www.cer.ie/cerdocs/cer06195.pdf</i>.

            <p eId="para_2527">The Government is committed to developing domestic scale renewable electricity and heat technologies. Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has undertaken work on Metering Options for Small Scale Renewable and CHP Electricity Generation. The study identified a number of areas which require further analysis including the ability of such processes to secure adequate payment for their exports, a review of connection standards and processes for smaller generators, and the implications of the Single Electricity Market for small-scale electricity generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2528">These technical and administrative issues are currently being addressed, and my Department is working with the relevant agencies, including SEI, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), ESB Networks and the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2529">As part of the ongoing work to progress this area, the CER has recently launched a public consultation on arrangements for micro generation which deals with metering issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2530">We are working to ensure that the appropriate administrative, technical and safety standards and practices are in place to underpin programmes for the widespread deployment of micro generation technologies. I am confident that appropriate solutions suited to the context of the Irish electricity grid and for non-grid connected technologies will be developed with a view to progressing this emerging sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_2532">Section 16 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (the Act) prescribes that a person shall not construct or reconstruct a generating station unless an authorisation has been granted by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).</p>
            <p eId="para_2533">The conditions under which the CER may grant or refuse to grant a license to generate electricity are prescribed out in Section 14 (1) of the Act, as amended by sections 32 and 16 of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2000 and 2005 respectively (SI 445 of 2000 and SI 60 of 2005).</p>
            <p eId="para_2534">I am advised that under the existing application process, applicants must provide certain information to the CER as set out in the application forms and guidance notes published on the CER's website. This process provides that applications regarding generating stations below 5 MW need not be accompanied by the same financial information as those above 5MW.</p>
            <p eId="para_2535">This reduced information requirement is in line with Section 17 (2B) of the Act as inserted by Regulation 14 (c) of SI 60 of 2005, which requires that the CER ensures that authorisation procedures for small generators and distributed generation take into account their limited size and potential impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_2536">Applications for an authorisation are assessed under the criteria stated in SI 309 of 1999 (Electricity Regulation Act (Criteria for Determination of Authorisations) Order, 1999). Following the amendments to the Act arising from SI 60 of 2005, the CER may now licence the generation of electricity and authorise the construction or reconstruction of a class or classes of generating stations by way of Order. As outlined in Sections 16(3A) and 14(1A) of the Act, the construction or reconstruction and the generation of electricity from such generating stations will be subject to the terms and conditions as may be specified in the relevant Order.</p>
            <p eId="para_2537">I am advised that the CER is currently reviewing the process for the granting of authorisations and licenses. It is holding a public consultation in this regard and has published a consultation paper on its website at <i>http://www.cer. ie/cerdocs/cer06195.pdf</i>. Interested parties have been invited to contact the CER before 27 October 2006.</p>

Luxembourg and Spain have done so by referendum while thirteen Member States have ratified by parliamentary means. Finland is expected to complete its ratification procedures in the coming months. As the House is aware, the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums held in France and the Netherlands last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2540">Following the referendum results in France and the Netherlands, the European Council initiated a period of reflection in order to allow time for further consideration of how to proceed with the Constitutional Treaty. In June 2006, the European Council agreed to extend the reflection period for another year and to focus also on the Union's delivery of tangible results to EU citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_2541">The European Council also mandated the Presidency to consult extensively with Member States and to present a report to the European Council in June 2007. That report is to contain an assessment of the state of discussions with regard to the Constitutional Treaty and to explore possible future developments. The report is intended to allow the European Council to point the way forward towards decisions on the Constitutional Treaty, which are expected to be taken during the second half of 2008 at the latest.</p>
            <p eId="para_2542">In line with its mandate from the European Council, the Finnish Presidency is currently holding a series of bilateral consultations with Member States. In these discussions, Ireland re-iterated our strong commitment to the Treaty as agreed by Heads of State and Government in 2004, and affirmed also our readiness to proceed with ratification once there is clarity on the way forward at EU level. The Presidency was also advised of our view that the Constitutional Treaty is a carefully constructed package and remains the best available option for equipping the Union with the means to meet the challenges facing us now and into the future. For this reason, we believe that any attempt to alter the essential balance and substance of the draft Treaty would be unlikely to succeed.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2544">Three Principal Development Specialists serve in Irish Aid headquarters in Dublin. None of the three has applied to decentralise to Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_2545">There are twelve Senior Development Specialists at Irish Aid headquarters. None of the twelve is applying to decentralise to Limerick, though two originally did so, but subsequently withdrew their applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_2546">Finally, there are nine Development Specialist posts at headquarters. At present five specialists are scheduled to decentralise, four who commenced employment since the announcement of the decentralisation programme in December 2003, and one who applied via the Central Applications Facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_2547">There is an ongoing Labour Court case regarding the terms and conditions under which technical grades are employed in various areas of the public service, including the specialists employed by Irish Aid. Technical staff employed by Government Departments and Offices, including specialists and other fixed-term workers employed in Irish Aid, brought cases to the Rights Commissioner under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003. The case, which involves complex legal issues, has been referred to the European Court of First Instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2548">Some of the issues involved in the decentralisation of Irish Aid to Limerick have, therefore, a wider Civil Service dimension and must be resolved at the central level. Discussions are on-going with representatives of the specialists, with their union IMPACT, and with the Department of Finance about the issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2549">Decentralisation is a Government decision and the Government is committed to moving ahead with its implementation. At present 47 posts in the Directorate are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. A further 17 officers who are serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, are also expected to decentralise to Limerick and will be taking up duty in Irish Aid in advance of the move. In addition, 21 officers from other Departments who have applied to decentralise to Limerick, most of whom are currently based in provincial locations, will transfer to the Department closer to the date of the move. Once these officers take up duty in Irish Aid, 85 posts (69% of the Directorate's staff complement) will be in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2550">A small number of staff, approximately 15 at entry grades, will be recruited for direct assignment to Limerick in the months preceding the move.</p>
            <p eId="para_2551">Almost all of the senior management team for Limerick will be in place by the end of this year. The Director General of Irish Aid has already indicated that he will decentralise to Limerick. There are now five Counsellors in place in the Directorate, who have volunteered to go to Limerick and a further three Counsellors will take up duty over the next two months. The changeover of the senior management team, just as in other grades, has been implemented in a planned and careful way so as to minimise disruption to the business of the Directorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2552">While there are challenges ahead, management and staff are working effectively together to maintain the quality and integrity of the programme. It would be my hope that a greater number of specialists will, in time, volunteer to decentralise to Limerick.</p>

            <p eId="para_2568">The EU General Affairs and External Relations Council, at its meeting on 30-31 January, adopted conclusions which welcomed the proposed launch of the Afghanistan Compact and reaffirmed the EU's commitment to long-term support for the Government and people of Afghanistan through Afghan-led reconstruction efforts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2569">The Afghanistan Compact was launched at the International Conference on Afghanistan in London on 31 January/1 February and was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1659 on 15 February. The Compact will guide the joint efforts of the Afghan Government and the international community in meeting outstanding challenges across three pillars of activity: security; governance; rule of law and human rights, and economic and social development. Counter-narcotics was identified as a crosscutting priority in the Compact. The Compact notes that Afghanistan's transition to peace and stability is not yet assured and that strong international engagement will be required to address remaining challenges. Ireland pledged €5 million at the launch of the Compact, which will be expended over the next two years. Ireland has contributed a total of €22 million to reconstruction and recovery programmes in Afghanistan since January 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_2570">Within the EU, discussions are currently taking place at working group level on possible further EU support for the rule of law sector in Afghanistan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2571">The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1707 on 12 September 2006 extending the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF) until October 2007. ISAF is an UN Chapter VII operation originally mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 1386 of 20 December 2001. The Resolution authorised "the establishment for 6 months of an International Security Assistance Force to assist the Afghan Interim Authority in the maintenance of security in Kabul and its surrounding areas, so that the Afghan Interim Authority as well as the personnel of the United Nations can operate in a secure environment". Subsequent UN Security Council Resolutions extended the period of authorisation of the Force. Resolution 1510 of 13 October 2003 authorised expansion of the Mission's geographical area "outside of Kabul and its environs". ISAF is not a UN force, however. Rather it is a coalition of NATO members and other contributing nations deployed under the authorisation of the UN Security Council. In exercising its mandate, ISAF works in close consultation with the democratically elected Government of Afghanistan. Seven members of the Permanent Defence Force currently serve in ISAF.</p>
            <p eId="para_2572">On 23 March, the UN Security Council decided to extend the mandate of the UN Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) for a further 12-month period. UNAMA's mandate includes assisting in implementation of the Afghanistan Compact, promoting human rights, providing technical assistance, and managing all UN humanitarian relief, recovery, reconstruction and development activities in coordination with the Afghan Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2573">The UN Security Council was briefed on the situation in Afghanistan on 9 October and announced that it would send a Council delegation, at an appropriate time, possibly in November, to review the situation on the ground and to reassure Afghanistan of the international community's support.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2575">The most recent information and statistics on the HIV/AIDS epidemic are contained in the 2006 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic released by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). This report noted progress in declining HIV infection rates in a number of countries and increasing access to HIV treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2576">Adult HIV infection rates have decreased in certain countries and changes in behaviour to prevent infection have played a key part in these declines. For example, in Kenya adult infection rates have decreased from a peak of 10% in the late 1990's to 7% in 2003; in Uganda from over 15% to 7% today and in Zimbabwe from 26% in 2002 to 21% in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2577">Access to HIV treatment has improved markedly over the past two years, especially in developing countries. The number of people receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for HIV/AIDS more than tripled from 400,000 in 2003 to 1.3 million at the end of 2005. The greatest progress has been made in sub-Saharan Africa where the number on treatment reached 800 thousand.</p>
            <p eId="para_2578">The reality, however, is that the AIDS epidemic continues to outstrip global and national efforts to contain it. The overall number of people living with HIV has continued to increase in all regions of the world except the Caribbean. There were an additional five million new infections in 2005, the majority in women. The number of people living with HIV globally has reached its highest level with over 40 million people now infected. More than three million people died of AIDS related illnesses in 2005 including more than 500,000 children. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to more than 60% of all people living with HIV.</p>
            <p eId="para_2579">In addition to a long term sustained attack on poverty, a rapid increase in the scale and scope of HIV prevention programmes is urgently needed to stop the speed at which new infections are occurring. This needs to take place in the context of a comprehensive response to HIV and AIDS, which requires the simultaneous acceleration of treatment and prevention efforts with the ultimate goal of universal access to prevention, treatment and care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2580">Ireland has a very strong commitment to addressing HIV/AIDS. This has been reaffirmed in the White Paper on Irish Aid. HIV/AIDS is a key priority for Irish Aid's policies and programmes. Following the commitment made by the Taoiseach in his speech to the United Nations in September 2005, funding for HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases has increased to €100 million in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2581">Ireland will continue to work with the international community in advocating for a sustained and resourced global response to HIV/AIDS, strengthened leadership at all levels and improved coordination of resources and planning for HIV/AIDS prevention and control.</p>

The primary focus of the scheme will be the refurbishment and enhancement of existing arts and culture facilities.  Accordingly 70% of the total moneys available will, if feasible, be allocated for this purpose. The remaining 30% of the scheme's funds will be available for the development of new facilities.  My office has already forwarded information in relation to the new ACCESS II scheme to the West Cork Arts Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_2585">Applications will be accepted until November 17th 2006.  An independent selection committee will adjudicate on all applications received within the time limits set out in the guidelines and make recommendations.</p>

The Review is currently being finalised and I would hope that it will be published before year end.  On completion of this Review, the question of re-opening the Programme can be considered.  If the Programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities to submit applications under the terms that will apply.  Significant progress continues under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, where the priority is to support those projects remaining to be completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2591">I propose to take Questions Nos. 222, 224 and 225 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2592">Job creation measures and the provision of replacement industries are day-to-day operational matters for the Industrial Development agencies.  A central goal for the agencies is the achievement of balanced regional development.  The attractiveness of County Limerick lies in its position as a regional gateway, with a critical mass and infrastructure necessary to attract mobile investment to the region.  The most recent example of the attraction of Limerick as a location for new business was the decision by Northern Trust Corporation to create 300 high quality jobs in the financial services sector.  Another example is Vistakon, which recently announced its intentions to expand its Limerick operations and create some 120 jobs in high-end manufacturing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2593">The Government and the agencies recognise the need to provide high volume employment opportunities in County Limerick that provide sustainable jobs.  I am confident that the State Development agencies, in partnership with other key players, will strengthen their marketing and promotion efforts in the region and will continue to secure additional employment for the area, particularly in view of the situation at the companies in question.  Fortunately, there is a general buoyancy in overall employment in Co. Limerick as evidenced by the most recent Live Register figures released by the Central Statistics Office.  These show that for September, 2006, the figure for the County is 7,205 which is down significantly on the previous month's figure of 8,253.</p>

            <p eId="para_2663">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions.  The Forfás Annual Employment Survey records jobs gained and lost in companies supported by the Industrial Development Agencies.  It is important to remember that job creation and job losses are features of economic development in all countries as various sectors expand and contract in response to market demand for goods and services, competitive forces, restructuring and technological change.  Six IDA supported companies have ceased operations in County Clare since 2000, involving the loss of 275 jobs.  The table that follows this response gives a breakdown by year and location of these losses.  At the end of 2005 there were 1,024 people employed in nine IDA supported companies in County Clare, an increase of 95 persons compared to the end of 2004.  As employment figures are provided for the Forfás Survey on a confidential basis, it is not possible to provide data for individual companies.  The following table provides summary information regarding permanent jobs, job gains and job losses in IDA assisted companies for the years 2000-05 in County Clare:</p>

Applicants located outside the BMW region, as in the case of Southill, could apply for funding up to a maximum of 50% of eligible expenditure, or €300,000, whichever was the lesser. Applicants in Clár areas were entitled to apply for an additional 5% funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_2732">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_2733">To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April, 2000).  This measure was introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2734">Currently there are over 6,000 people over 55 years of age on CE.  This represents circa 29% of those on CE, a figure which has increased from 25% at year end 2005.  Funding for CE in 2006 is based on 22,000 places on CE schemes nationally, a figure which is similar to the 2005 allocation.</p>

There is currently no legislative basis for the subvention of public bus services provided by private bus operators.

The current position regarding this phase is that detailed design work is under way and Iarnród Éireann expects to submit a Railway Order application in mid 2007 for statutory approval to enable the railway upgrade works to proceed with a view to completion of phase 1 in 2009 as provided for in Transport 21.</p>

Tá súil agam go mbeidh an plé sin ann go luath.  Ní mór dom a chur in iúl don Teachta, áfach, nach dtagann foirmeacha faoi scáth alt 9(1) den Acht.

            <p eId="para_3607">I cannot respond categorically to the Deputy, as my Department has not received an application for funding from the group in question. It is possible that the group might qualify for funding under the recently advertised flagship projects scheme under Dormant Accounts. I should stress that until an application is received and can be assessed, I cannot be certain that the group would qualify for funding.  They may wish to consult my Departments website —<i>www.pobail.ie</i> — for further information or contact my Department’s Dormant Accounts section at 01-6473000.</p>

            <p eId="para_3632">My Department supports the training and professional development of staff working with children with special educational needs through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which was established in 2003. The service as appropriate, consolidates co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs in a variety of educational settings.

            <p eId="para_3636">Under the terms of my Department's 2006 Third Level Student Maintenance Grant Schemes the position is that, generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the prescribed conditions with regard to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. A mature student is defined for the purposes of the schemes as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</p>
            <p eId="para_3637">Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined as meaning a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</p>
            <p eId="para_3638">When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the means test provision of the scheme specifies that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.</p>
            <p eId="para_3639">It is understood from Co. Louth VEC, the assessing authority in this case, that the candidate referred to by the Deputy is under 23 and  that her parents are separated.  The candidate is not eligible for the maintenance grant as the reckonable income in this case — i.e. the combined income from her mother's employment and her own Department of Social and Family Affairs payment exceed the prescribed limit for the 2005 tax year as set out in the grant scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3640">I regret that it is not possible to allow grant aid where reckonable income exceeds the prescribed limits irrespective of the particular circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_3641">Apart from the funding provided through the Student Support Maintenance Grant Schemes, financial assistance is also available from my Department through the Student Assistance Fund which is administered by the National Office for Equity of Access to Third Level Education (National Office). The objective of the Fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Further information on this fund is available from the relevant third institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3642">The Deputy will appreciate that the terms of the schemes are of general application and it is not open to me to make exceptions in individual cases.</p>

The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_3645">The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the new School Support Programme under DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_3646">The ERC's overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage in the Education Act (1998), section 32(9), as: "the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools".</p>
            <p eId="para_3647">In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_3655">In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the School Support Programme were as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3656">Medical card data for Junior Certificate candidates (including Junior Certificate School Programme candidates)</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3657">Junior Certificate retention rates by school</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3658">Junior Certificate exam results aggregated to school level (expressed as an OPS — "Overall Performance Scale" — score). This was based on each student's performance in the seven subjects in which s/he performed best</p>

            <p eId="para_3660">As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP.

The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.

Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department's Website. The prioritisation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal in the first instance.

            <p eId="para_3680">Information in relation to classes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The reference date for the provision by schools of this information is the 30th September of the school year in question and the date for return by the schools is 31 October. Consequently, the details for the current school year (2006/2007) are not yet available.  The information for the previous 5 school years is provided in the table set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_3681">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary in recent years. There are now 4000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc. Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school. Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3682">As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06.   This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the average age at which infants enter primary school for the first time in each county; the number of schools per county which operate an age restrictive policy at present; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5138">The table set out below gives a detailed breakdown on a county by county basis of the average age at which infants entered primary school for the first time in the 2005/2006 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5139">The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age and Rule 64 (1) of the Rules for National Schools provides that a child must be at least 4 years of age before she/he may be enrolled in a National School.   Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a National School and overall there are more than enough places available.</p>
            <p eId="para_5140">Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. Neither does my Department require individual schools to provide details of enrolment criterion and therefore it does not hold details of the number of schools which operate age restrictive enrolment policies. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_5141">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_5142">Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with in 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</p>

It is not possible to provide a breakdown of the number of units which are affordable housing units as beneficiaries under the various affordable housing schemes may have moved from these houses to new private housing. However since 1991, some 25,395 households have benefited under these schemes.  Data on the number of housing units provided under the various affordable housing schemes each year are available in the Housing Statistics Bulletins which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Department's website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_5451">The most recent assessment of need for social housing, undertaken by local authorities in March 2005, indicated that there were 43,684 households on local authority waiting lists compared with 48,413 in March 2002.  More detailed results, including a breakdown of this figure by local authority, are available in my Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin for 2005, which is available on my Department's website —<i>www.environ.ie</i>.  </p>
