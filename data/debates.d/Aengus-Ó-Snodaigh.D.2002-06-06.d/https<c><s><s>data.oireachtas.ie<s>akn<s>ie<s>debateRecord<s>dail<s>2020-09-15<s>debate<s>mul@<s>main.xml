          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2">Public confidence in the Taoiseach's ability to manage the Covid-19 crisis has collapsed in recent months. Today, the Taoiseach promised clarity but instead we have had further confusion. Dublin is left in limbo, our citizens over the age of 70 are left without necessary guidance, and travel advice is confused and unsure again. Most striking is the absence of any comprehensive plan to step up testing and tracing capacity. The Taoiseach and I both know that some people are waiting for results of their tests in some cases for six or seven days. It is this inefficiency that allows the virus to take hold and to transmit across our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> The Taoiseach has again today made an appeal to individual citizens to shoulder their responsibilities, which is fair enough. The fact is, however, that the Taoiseach is failing in his. The Government can publish any plans it wants but they are not worth the paper they are written on so long as our testing and tracing capacities are so woefully inadequate. The Taoiseach has to get this right. A first-class testing and tracing system is the springboard for everything we want to see. It is the sure mechanism to allow people to return to work and stay at work safely and to allow children and students return to education and stay there safely. It is also essential to ensure our health system does not become overwhelmed at a time when trolley figures are creeping back up and waiting lists of outpatient appointments are at record levels. The truth is that the Taoiseach and his predecessor, Deputy Varadkar, have failed to put in place the testing and tracing system we need, which is the carrying out of at least 100,000 tests a week with a guaranteed result within 24 hours. We hear stories of people constantly waiting longer than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> Let it be said that the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, have had numerous opportunities to put in place this testing and tracing system. In April, the Taoiseach's now Cabinet colleagues, the Ministers, Deputies Varadkar and Harris, said they would be doing 100,000 tests a day by mid-May. We are now in September and that target has not been reached. Back in May the then Taoiseach dismissed my call for these 100,000 tests a week, and he did so in a very arrogant and condescending manner. The occasion of the publication of the reopening roadmap was another chance to get testing and tracing right, but this did not happen. The Taoiseach formed his Government at the end of June and again it was a prime opportunity to get things right and to put an emphasis on testing and tracing. The Taoiseach failed again.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">Infection rates dropped over the course of the summer and the Government was again presented with an opportunity to get this right but it did not do so and now the virus has caught up with us. The people in Kildare, Laois and Offaly have already paid a very heavy price for the Government's failure and now the people of Dublin face further restrictions and more disruption to their lives. The growing rates of infection and this disruption are directly related to the Government's failure to get things right.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> Amid all the bluster and the very long press conference the Taoiseach hosted earlier today, there is on inescapable truth; either we get testing and tracing right and do it quickly or we will be consigned to a yo-yo effect of further restrictions and even lockdowns. I have no doubt that citizens will carry the burden of their responsibilities but the Government must also measure up to its responsibilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_7">The Government published a very comprehensive plan today for living with Covid-19 for the next six months. The plan has three key principles, namely, to protect the lives and health of our people and to limit the damage that Covid-19 can do to peoples' health long-term; to protect employment and economic resilience as best we can and to keep jobs in our economy and enterprises viable; and to improve the quality of life through the restoration of public services. We want to do what we did with the schools, a confidence-boosting measure which the Deputy failed to acknowledge.</p>

          <p eId="para_16">It is unprecedented for people to be intervening but perhaps it is the Sinn Féin way. It is unparliamentary.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> I regret the fact the Deputy has decided to take a very partisan political approach to this issue today. </p>
          <p eId="para_18"> In terms of public services, I have already referenced education. The plan is also about the unprecedented challenges facing our health services over the coming winter. An additional €600 million has been allocated for innovative measures to deal with capacity issues right through the six months. That is additional money on top of what is there to the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> In terms of testing and tracing, I note the contrast in the Deputy's language today around testing and tracing and the performance of the HSE with her approach when I facilitated a briefing with the HSE about two weeks ago. There was none of this talk then about "woeful" performance. More than 1 million tests have been carried out in this country since the beginning of the pandemic. Ireland is right up there with other European countries in terms of its testing capacity. It is not good enough for the Deputy to attack people as being "woeful" and to try to belittle the very strong measures that have been taken on testing. Of course we all want it to increase and ramp up but the system can carry out 15,000 tests per day now. It has been at that level for some time now and is under a lot of pressure in terms of community needs and requirements. Deputy McDonald ignored the serial testing programme in nursing homes that was undertaken. It was very comprehensive and has been conducted twice now. It yielded very low positivity rates, thanks be to God, but has kept pressure on the virus in those locations and elsewhere as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> The plan published today is comprehensive and deals with a whole range of areas. Fundamentally it is about keeping people safe, protecting as many jobs as possible and restoring public services. In terms of quality of life issues, it is about helping and assisting sports and the arts in particular to provide performances, notwithstanding the limitations of Covid-19 itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">It seems to me that the Taoiseach is making it up as he goes along. If the Government was serious about protecting public health, employment and people's quality of life, it would measure up to a commitment made months ago that 100,000 tests would be carried out per week and that people would be in receipt of their results within 24 hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">I have the Covid app on my phone. It might interest the Taoiseach to know that over the past seven days, fewer than 75,000 tests were carried out. This is months on from a commitment to hit the target of 100,000 tests. To keep people safe, to keep the economy on track, to ensure that we have some quality of life, including social opportunities, it is my view that we need more than 100,000 tests per week, but the Government has not yet even reached that target.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> The truth is that when trouble flared in the midlands because of meat processing plants, and when numbers started to climb, by the Taoiseach's own admission and by his own Minister's admission, they did not have the testing and tracing capacity to catch up and there was a huge time lag. It is very telling that, in today's plan that the Taoiseach has issued, of 59 pages, just one of them addresses the issue of testing and tracing - the most central part of the plan and the Taoiseach has failed. I have to say to him that people in Dublin in particular today, but also throughout the State, are frustrated with the Taoiseach's inability to see the most basic thing, which is to get testing and tracing right and then allow us the opportunity for all else to follow.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">The Deputy is shamelessly playing politics with this and she knows it. I agree 100% in regard to testing and tracing and the centrality of it. It is in the plan and the Deputy knows it is in the plan in terms of ramping up testing capacity and contact tracing capacity, and extra numbers being employed. That is the reality. She talks about the midlands. The Government action on the midlands was quick and it was tough, but it yielded results in terms of stabilising the numbers in the midlands and getting the numbers down in Laois, Offaly and Kildare at the time. That will continue. We will continue to improve and to strengthen our testing and tracing responses, and it is a central part of the plan that we have outlined today.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Critically, we also have to be straight with people in terms of the need for all of us to take personal responsibility and adhere to the public health guidance. We have accepted NPHET’s advice in regard to Dublin today and the Government has acted on that, and NPHET will meet again next week in that respect. Our fundamental objective will always be to protect lives and the protection of harm to people as a result of Covid-19, and then maintaining the essential public services we need, that our children and young people need in going to college and to education, and putting in all the resources we can to withstand what will be a lot of significant pressures in the winter time on our health service as a result of Covid-19. Both of those are very important, as well as other aspects of the economy and jobs.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Kelly<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_26">Obviously, today is a very important day. Since the Government basically gave up on the roadmap, this is the day we were all waiting for. I acknowledge all the work that has been done in regard to the reopening of schools and educational establishments. We in the Labour Party acknowledge all that work and the work in regard to the ongoing challenges in the health services. However, there is an inherent contradiction in what was brought out today, and this is not playing politics. This is not a five-point plan; this is a 5.5-point plan. It is the talk of the country because we need clarity. We cannot have a situation where we have Dublin at two and a bit, and they sort of get a yellow card, but if they behave themselves, in a short space of time they may go back to where all the rest of us are. It is like something Orwellian, where some people are more equal than others. If the Taoiseach said that to the people in Laois, Offaly and Kildare, they would not agree with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> We have to protect everyone's lives equally throughout this country. The virus does not distinguish between Dublin and Kildare, Laois or Offaly. Therefore, I am encouraging the Taoiseach, by tonight, to give full clarity. I agree with, and we in the Labour Party support, the five-point plan - let me be very clear about that. I even had conversations with the Taoiseach to the same effect some time ago. However, I do not support a 5.5-point plan. By tonight, the Taoiseach should make his decisions and give clear advice once and for all as to where Dublin is at.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Is it at two or three? I listened to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, give a radio interview afterwards. He was asked about travel outside of Dublin for people from Dublin and he said "Yes". However, these additional restrictions were only produced after the Taoiseach's press conference. They state that those living in Dublin "should be encouraged to limit travel outside the region". They also list a number of other things, including third level institutions, which I would discuss further if I had time.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I was taken by the Taoiseach's incapacity to answer Mr. Gavan Reilly during today's press conference. He asked the Taoiseach how we can know that the five levels will not be modified again. The Taoiseach said they will not because this has been adopted today, but then he qualified it by saying it might be worth Mr. Reilly's while to talk to the CMO. Why was the CMO not present today? That would have been helpful. Will the Taoiseach please give clarity on this issue by tonight? There are five phases, and we support the five phases. It is the right thing to do. However, 5.5 phases is not the right thing to do because it sets a precedent. What happens to Louth or some other county in a few weeks if it reaches a certain threshold and people ask why it cannot be treated like Dublin? That is the real issue the Taoiseach is dealing with today. I urge the Taoiseach to provide that clarity by tonight so everyone can move on and support him.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Finally, will the Taoiseach also clarify that he and the Government did not deviate in any way from NPHET's advice in drawing up this plan? If they did, will he give details on what that was?</p>

          <p eId="para_47">Also, it is not two and a half, or two and a bit. NPHET gave us advice on Dublin and we acted on that advice. We were in transition from the first model to this new model that is in the new plan. NPHET gave advice prior to it being adopted by the Government during the week. The modification relates to wet pubs and the matches. That is it. There is no big deal here, in one sense. It is a very big deal for the pubs and their livelihoods, to be fair, but in terms of the broader overall plan the issue is that we got advice from NPHET and we did not want to ignore it. The alternative was to move to level 3, if that is what the Deputy is suggesting. That is the advice. We did not get advice from NPHET on Thursday to move to level 3. The Deputy wants the Government to move to level 3.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T13:45:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_49">That seems to be the implication. We accepted NPHET's advice today in respect of Dublin. NPHET will meet again on Thursday and it could give other advice in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> I think the Deputy was unfair in what he said about a question I was asked. I said that the CMO can go into more technical detail. To be fair, this goes back to the Tipperary question. The numbers were going high in Tipperary and the Deputy was worried that there would be a lockdown, to call a spade a spade. However, there are different iterations and different patterns which do not necessarily mean that when one looks at the volume of numbers one should jump to a certain conclusion. That is what I meant, and the CMO and public health officials will say the same thing. Not every county will be the same. Numbers will emerge in certain counties and there might be reasons behind those numbers that demand a specific type of response which is different from a response in a different county. That is just the reality, and that is how the public health advice will emerge and evolve over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> On the more fundamental point, I accept the Deputy's point that he agrees with and supports the five levels. I appreciate that. It is positive. It has to be for six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">That will give people clarity. The Government makes decisions based on advices on a number of matters. The broad thrust of NPHET's advice on the five levels has been accepted, as has the advice on congregation and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">The Taoiseach's own Minister rang me at the time to tell me that Tipperary was not going into lockdown. I ask the Taoiseach to correct the record on that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_36">

          <p eId="para_55">That is what he said to me. He actually asked me to relay that information on my local radio station. The Taoiseach should ask the Minister about it himself and then he might come in here to apologise and correct the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> However, there are bigger issues here. First, will the Taoiseach answer the question on whether people in Dublin should travel outside the county? The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has made statements on the matter which are contradictory to this document. Second, the Taoiseach did not answer the question as to whether there was any specific NPHET advice on this plan which the Government did not adopt. If so, will he tell us what that advice was? If not, that is fine. Third, I was very disappointed that, although I asked for it on numerous occasions, this document was not elderly-proofed or proofed for people with disabilities. We need greater clarity on how we will ensure that people who are vulnerable or elderly can have some quality of life during these phases. That is a glaring omission. Finally, does the Taoiseach accept that the Tánaiste's comments regarding a Covid vaccine have created even greater confusion? As I was driving to Dublin this morning, I spoke to an elderly gentleman who said to me that this was great news and there must be some information available to the Government that is not available to the rest of us.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">It is great to keep throwing out the word and hoping it sticks. That is what some of these contributions are about. The Tánaiste was very clear. He said very clearly that he hoped there would be a vaccine in the first half of 2021. That is what he said to us this morning. That got translated into something else but that is what he said to us. Most people are saying there could be a vaccine in the first half of 2021. The WHO believes there could be a vaccine around March or April but no one is definitive about that because we cannot be. It depends on clinical trials and how various candidate vaccines progress during the research and clinical trial phases. The only good news is that an unprecedented number of companies, more than ever in our history, are chasing and researching a vaccine for one virus. We need success on that front in order to enable us to get beyond the very damaging impact of Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> The advice from NPHET is very clear that Dubliners are encouraged not to travel outside of Dublin. NPHET is encouraging people not to travel if possible. That is the advice as of now.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> As regards supporters and so on, NPHET was not overly prescriptive. There was a discussion on some of those modest issues but there was no major deviation in the broad thrust of the advice.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">Anybody tuning into the press conference this morning expecting to get clarity and coherent advice will have been bitterly disappointed. The press conference today brought a Government message that was confused and extremely confusing to the public. The new plan was supposed to provide clarity about the five levels of risk, yet on the first day of the announcement, the Government decided to muddy the waters by talking about level two and a bit. People wanted direction and political leadership. People are worried and concerned about the rising rate of the virus and they want clear advice and coherence from the Government. They certainly did not get that this morning. In the two areas for which the Government has direct responsibility, it was found to be seriously wanting. The first of those is the principal part the Government should be playing in the fight against Covid-19, namely, putting in place a timely and effective testing and tracing system.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The Government has known this from the start, and at no point has it got to the stage where we had an effective system that was able to turn around testing and tracing in a timely manner at the level required. We heard just last week that the HSE is in the process of recruiting 700 staff. The Minister for Health stated this morning that thousands of staff will be recruited at some point in the future. The Government has not done its part of the deal by getting the testing and tracing in place, and the public cannot do anything about that. It is the Government's responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> The second area the Government ignored completely this morning is that of international travel. It has effectively parked that, waiting to hear from the EU, until the middle of October. In the meantime, is anyone in charge of international travel? Judging by the figures, it seems that nobody is.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> What are the specific criteria for categorising counties as being in one of the five levels? Additionally, what are the specific criteria for counties moving from one level to another? I refer to specifics such as the rate of the virus, the rate of increase and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> What does it mean to be at level 2.5, or level 2 and a bit? Where can the public in Dublin, who desperately want to play their part in tackling the virus now because it is at such dangerous levels, get information on what being at level 2.5 means? It is not on the Government website and it was not provided this morning. Where can they find out the new regulations that apply in Dublin?</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> In respect of the rates in Dublin, why is the Government treating Dublin as one homogenous area? The rates in Dublin vary from 42 to 131 per 100,000. There is a strong case for localised data on an electoral division basis weekly or at least fortnightly. Why will the Government not provide those data and enable people to play their part in working together as neighbourhoods in fighting this virus?</p>

I said earlier that NPHET advice came prior to the adoption by the Government of the new plan. The Deputy knows that. There are two issues, namely, wet pubs and people attending matches in stadia with capacities of more than 5,000 people. They are the two issues that deviate from level 2 as now adopted by the Government. That is it.</p>

NPHET will come forward with advice on Thursday and I hope and trust that the Deputy will accept whatever decisions we have to take in respect of Dublin, as per the advice from NPHET. I have already begun to see, in the question about different locations in Dublin, people trying to wheedle out of any issues that might arise. The acting Chief Medical Officer - not the Government - is very clear on the application of measures throughout Dublin and on taking Dublin as one homogenous unit, one entire area. He has stated there is only one area of Dublin whose rate is appreciably lower than those of the rest, namely, Dublin South. That is the information he has given me and we can publish all the figures. There is no issue with that. The Deputy should not bring forward a fallacy to suggest there are some significant differences, or that only some areas of Dublin are particularly bad and the rest are okay. That is not what we are being told by NPHET-----</p>

          <p eId="para_95">Like thousands of other people, I listened to the press conference this morning and I found it extremely confusing. In regard to Dublin, people in Dublin desperately want to fight this virus and they want clear advice. The Taoiseach said this morning that the country is in level 2 yet the level 2 regulations do not apply to people in Dublin. Dublin is not in level 3, so what level is it in? The term level 2.5 or 2 plus a bit applies because the message is confusing. Dublin is not in level 2, so what level is it in? One cannot help but think the issue is a lack of political leadership and courage in decisions around this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> There has been only one briefing of the Opposition parties since the end of April. The Government is leaving the Opposition completely outside of this area. It is not engaging with the Opposition or taking advice from a wider circle. On the Taoiseach's other point with regard to NPHET, the Government set down the regulations in the five-level plan yet each level, practically, is qualified by the statement that if NPHET changes the advice the plan will change. How can the Government blame people for being confused about what is being said? It is entirely confusing. </p>

          <p eId="para_120">For the Government's roadmap on Covid-19 to be effective and gain public support it needs to be clear, consistent, to make sense and to embrace the principle of fairness and all of us being in it together. To date, the Government's measures and proposals have failed on those counts. The signs are that today's announcements from the Government are failing in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">I want to focus on one key aspect, which is the fairness principle or the idea that we are all in this together. If we do not take all our society with us, and particularly those who are affected by measures and health restrictions, everything will unravel.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> One of the affected groups, which I have mentioned repeatedly to the Taoiseach, has come out today in record numbers in a socially distant, masked protest in individual cars. These are the taxi drivers and their protest reached from Ballyfermot to Merrion Square. It is the biggest taxi protest ever. These people used to make their livelihood on the road but there is no roadmap for them. There is no respect or fairness and the Government is ignoring them. Their incomes and livelihoods have been decimated while they accept that the restrictions have affected their industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> Whereas others have got support in order to keep them in employment, keep up incomes and keep businesses viable, taxi drivers have got nothing. They have been placed between a rock and hard place. They can stay on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, which the Government is going to cut, but many of these people are vulnerable and over 66. Otherwise they can go back to work and lose all the pandemic unemployment payment when a fraction of their previous income is available. We can think about everything on which they depend and which is affected by the restrictions. They include international travel, gigs, theatres, social gatherings and taking people from pubs and nightclubs. Everything on which they rely to make an income is gone or drastically reduced, and nothing has been given back.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> As people on the protest today have said, they are not cars; they are mothers, fathers, sons and people with mortgages or rent to pay. They are a vital part of our public transport system, which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, does not seem to understand. They bring people to hospital and politicians to RTÉ. They respond where there are no bus routes and at unsocial hours. They are a vital part of our public transport system.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> They are asking for an income subsidy if they return to work. They are asking that no cut be made to their PUP if they feel they cannot go to work, particularly if they are over 66. They are asking for grants to cover ongoing costs, which run to approximately €11,000 per year, even if they do nothing to keep their car on the road. They are asking for the ten-year replacement rule for vehicles to go to 12 years because they do not have an income that allows them to replace their cars. They are asking the Government to stop issuing new licences when there is not enough work for the taxi drivers that are out there. They are asking that there be no question of the threat of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to remove them from quality bus corridors and bus lanes being pushed through. This would absolutely kick them when they are down. I ask the Taoiseach to respond to the requests of the taxi drivers.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and I know he has genuinely pursued it for quite some time. I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about this and I take fully on board the necessity to do something for taxi drivers and people in similar positions who may not have come under the ambit of the restart grant. I specifically mention people who could not be included in the rates-based system where supports could be administered in the way we did for many small enterprises and businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> The Government is considering how to combine the PUP with some measures that would enable people in such positions, such as those in the arts sector, where the level of activity is much lower than it would have been prior to the onset of Covid-19, to earn additional income without losing the basic payment. That is something I have asked the Government to look at and we are engaging on that. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, met taxi representative groups last week. He is clear in the view that they will not be stopped from using or banned from quality bus corridors. He made the point clearly to me this morning that it was not on the agenda at all and he was a bit nonplussed as to how it got on the agenda to start with. He has said it will not happen with regard to BusConnects and has been very clear about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> The Deputy raised other matters and the waiving of late renewal fees has been implemented until March 2021. The Minister is open to meeting representatives of the industry. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Tánaiste and others are genuinely interested in seeing what we can do to respond to a genuine need.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">I am not arguing with the nuts and bolts of what the Deputy has presented. There are still some sectors which have nowhere near the same degree of business activity that they once had because of Covid-19 and Government mandates based on public health advice. Their incomes have fallen dramatically as a result. Some people may encounter problems if they discontinue the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment for a few work projects because they may find that unsustainable in the medium term. I understand that. There is a need to do something about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">I welcome the withdrawal of the crazy suggestion, which seems to have come from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, of removing taxi drivers from bus lanes. We need more than vague commitments. We need very specific commitments. Subsidies have gone to other industries that have lost 20% or 30% of turnover. Taxi drivers have lost 40% or 50% of turnover. The more drivers return to work, the more turnover will decrease, especially if there are more restrictions. As long as Covid-19 exists and restrictions apply, there will not be a viable living for taxi drivers by a margin of at least 50%. They also face ongoing costs of about €1,000 a month, which they cannot cover. They have been clocking up debts over the past six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> If other industries rightly received grants and income subsidies, those should be extended to taxi drivers and to another group I have mentioned repeatedly and which is also holding a protest tomorrow, namely, the live music, arts and entertainment sector. Those workers need the same thing. We need those commitments. It is madness to continue to issue taxi licences at the moment when there is not nearly enough work for the 22,000 drivers who already hold one. I ask the Taoiseach please to get a move on. Taxi drivers need help or their industry and their livelihoods will be utterly destroyed. They are desperate and they are appealing for urgent action.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will continue to engage with the representatives of taxi drivers to discuss measures to ease the burden on them during what is a very difficult time for them. As I have said to the Deputy before, issues arise in administering these measures to protect all involved, ensure money gets to those who really need and deserve it, ensure verification etc. That said, there is a need to assist the sectors the Deputy has identified which have not really benefited from restart grants or other interventions which had the merit of involving local authorities insofar as businesses had to be subject to commercial rates, which allowed for ease of administration. Other sectors have not had that benefit. There is no doubt that hospitality and the sectors dependent on tourism and travel have been hit hardest. The Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment has been a very significant intervention by the Government, to the value of €3.3 billion. That will continue and we are now opening it up to new entrants until the end of the year. That represents fairness and a good intervention by the State on behalf of the taxpayer.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">We requested the Government to publish the draft regulations that will replace the regulations which will soon expire and which are having such a profound impact on people's lives, and that we would debate those regulations in this Chamber.

          <p eId="para_137">We too in the Rural Independent Group have significant concerns. The lack of clarity is astounding. Today's announcement brought no further clarity. The regulations were changed last Thursday week when the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 was debated, voted on and passed by the House. The regulations were supposed to run out last Sunday night, but I do not know whether that happened. The Taoiseach could not tell me that when I spoke to him. We do not know where we are. Why can the Taoiseach not explain the situation to the House? Why is the Government taking on well known and high-powered PR companies? The people want empathy. They do not want sympathy anymore but want support and clarity instead. They are not getting them and we need them, so we are not happy either to support the proposal.</p>

We will continue to oppose those changed speaking arrangements. I point out that trying to gag and silence some voices in the House is not the way for the Government to bring everybody with it. Last week, we saw an example of what that will mean when the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, was not present for the contributions of the lead spokespeople of approximately five of the groupings in this House.

          <p eId="para_209">We also raised this issue last Thursday. We are asking hundreds of thousands of workers, students, teachers, doctors and nurses to work in conditions that we are not demanding of ourselves in these Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The imagery from the Convention Centre is appalling. It is a cavernous space with huge gaps between us. It is not sustainable so our party has put forward proposals for the third time. They are currently being examined. We will oppose the Order of Business every week until we get all Dáil business back to Leinster House and we have a similar standard for Deputies and Senators as we expect for hundreds of thousands of workers, students, teachers, doctors and nurses.</p>

          <p eId="para_211">As the Ceann Comhairle knows, the Independent Group has consistently opposed sittings in the Convention Centre and has asked that we would come back here to Leinster House when it is safe to do so, with a view to examining the possibility of having 1 m social distancing. I have nothing against the Convention Centre and I compliment the staff here and in the Convention Centre for looking after us. As the Ceann Comhairle is aware, we also put forward a position paper which we have discussed. I thank him, and Charles Hearne, for the interim report issued today, and I believe we will discuss it again on Thursday. I am happy with that progress but I agree with the reasons outlined by Deputy Mac Lochlainn. We are creating a bad image. We should be able to work and show leadership when we expect hundreds of thousands of people, and children in schools and everything else, to work in restricted places. We should do our best here. I believe we are doing our best with the examination of this report, so I am happy to wait until Thursday's meeting to discuss it again.</p>

I have to say I am somewhat at a loss, and the way they vote is a matter for Members, because we are actively engaged in pursuing and investigating the proposals made for a return. I do not understand what that has got to do with the Order of Business but it is the Deputy's prerogative.</p>

          <p eId="para_268">As we all know, taxi drivers have endured a really terrible time. Their business has collapsed and they see very little light at the end of the tunnel. Earlier the Taoiseach indicated that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is willing to continue to engage with the taxi drivers' representatives. I hope this proves to be true and it is welcome news. I put it to the Taoiseach that he should support the motion Sinn Féin will bring before the Dáil this evening that sets out all the fundamental asks of taxi drivers up and down the State. Aside from financial assistance and help, it includes a pause on the issuing of new licences, reform of the taxi advisory committee, continued access to bus lanes, which is an issue, and temporary two-year extensions to the rule that requires taxis to be less than ten years old. All of these are practical responses and very necessary responses for the taxi industry. Will the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues support the Sinn Féin motion?</p>

          <p eId="para_269">As I said earlier, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, met with the representatives of the taxi drivers last week and he has indicated that he will continue that engagement with them. I also made it clear that there is no question of taxi drivers not having access to new bus lanes. The Minister was very clear on that to me this morning. In my replies earlier to Deputy Boyd Barrett, who had raised the matter in Leaders' Questions, I also indicated that the Government was disposed to looking at aspects of the interventions so far in terms of helping businesses and people in particular sectors of the economy with income support above and beyond the pandemic unemployment payment itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_270">Perhaps the Taoiseach will clarify a matter because I was a bit confused earlier. Will the regulations be signed for all the changes coming into effect from tonight?</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> On the flu vaccine, we are aware that children up to the age of 12, anyone who works in the health service, and at-risk groups are getting the vaccination. I am hearing worrying concerns from GPs around a shortage of vaccines. Why are GP practices being severely limited in the doses they receive? A practice in Cork, for example, was told it would only get 200 doses. Another practice with five doctors was limited to 70 doses of the vaccine. Dr. Nina Byrnes tweeted this morning that her practice has been told that only 100 vaccines could be ordered for delivery. Is there an issue here? There is a concern we will not get enough vaccine to carry out the desperate need for vaccinations between now and Christmas. Can the Taoiseach clarify that all GPs will be able to get the volume of doses required to vaccinate those groups?</p>

          <p eId="para_273">Over the past week we have seen devastating scenes from the Moria refugee camp on the island of Lesbos in Greece.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> We have seen very distressing images of thousands of children and unaccompanied minors sleeping rough with no access to water or sanitation. The Immigrant Council of Ireland has called it a humanitarian crisis. Germany and France have committed to taking some of the minors in as asylum seekers. Has Ireland also committed to doing so? How many unaccompanied minors will we take in and when will it happen? It is very important that Ireland plays its part quickly because we cannot leave those children in such a vulnerable position in Greece.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, spoke with his Greek counterpart on 9 September, immediately after the fire and offered Ireland's full solidarity and support. The Greek Government has requested assistance from its European partners in dealing with the immediate humanitarian need. Without question this tragedy has highlighted the need for urgent action on the part of the EU to address the current migration situation in the Mediterranean. The European Commission is due to publish a major new proposal on reforming the European Union migration and asylum system, a new Pact on Asylum and Migration in the coming weeks. We will work closely with our EU partners to progress efforts in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> On unaccompanied minors, the German Presidency of the EU has requested that 400 such minors who were resident at the camp be relocated to other EU countries. My colleague, the Minister with responsibility for children, disability, equality and integration, Deputy O'Gorman, has confirmed that he is working with Tusla to arrange for the swift reception into Ireland of a group of four unaccompanied children from Moria in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and the Mandate trade union have sent proposals to the Government for a State-run scheme to fund enhanced redundancies in the event of liquidation and to be paid for by increased employer social insurance contributions. It has been suggested that were such a scheme to be agreed in principle an advance payment might be made to resolve the Debenhams dispute by meeting the demand of the workers for two plus two or four week's pay per year of service. The view from the picket line is that this is a positive proposal but that it is medium to long-term and does not in any way change the need to keep the strike going, if not to escalate the dispute right now. This is an entirely understandable response given that the workers have been out for 159 days to date. This could be more than a medium-term project if it were to be prioritised by the Government and moved through the House in September or early October. Can the Taoiseach offer the Debenhams workers any hope that his Government will seize the opportunity to fast-track this idea in the coming weeks?</p>

          <p eId="para_280">Sometimes proposals are presented as if they are simple to do but the idea of increasing social insurance contributions from all employers in order to cover the failings of some raises its own questions. There is also the issue of retrospection in terms of how one could apply any funding that would be raised in the future on foot of legislation passed here. These issues are being examined by the Department with responsibility for business, enterprise and innovation, led by the Tánaiste but they are not simple.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> The Deputy has suggested that this is a medium to long-term proposal and it would need a lot of teasing out. I had a very preliminary conversation with ICTU on it some time ago. The proposal needs to be fleshed out in some considerable detail regarding what is envisaged.</p>

I welcome the announcement that spectators are to be allowed to return to the games and matches that are part of our culture. Up to 50 patrons or spectators are allowed at indoor sporting events but dancing classes, rince scoile, and other artistic events are restricted to six people. Dancing classes often take place in GAA centres across the country. Are we saying that for sport we can have 50 spectators but for dancing classes and artistic events we cannot? There is confusion there. I also ask the Taoiseach to clarify the restrictions on hotels. Up to 50 people are allowed to attend a wedding but we are not sure if 50 can attend other events such as funeral dinners. Are such events confined to six people in pods? There is utter confusion. It is time for the hotel industry and the people to be given clarity. I must declare an interest with regard to rince scoile - the McGrath school of dance is run by my niece. There are many more dance schools in Tiobrad Árann and across the country that need to get back to their activities for the sake of physical and mental health and cultural experience.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">The provisions in levels one to five of the plan are informed by public health advice, particularly with regard to controlled and uncontrolled environments. Essentially we are talking about a combination of measures designed to reduce social contacts and limit congregation as much as possible while allowing for a reasonable quality of life in the context of sports, arts and so on. That is the overall principle. People will always look for subsets of this or that category but the overarching point is that NPHET and the public health doctors are very anxious to reduce the amount of uncontrolled engagement. That is what has informed the plan, the public health advice around that issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_291"> On Friday and again yesterday many students found out that the leaving certificate results given by their school had been adjusted downwards significantly by the standardisation process. Many people who made major sacrifices over the course of 12 months are deeply disappointed and are frustrated by the fact that the recourse open to them is very limited. I ask the Taoiseach to examine the possibility of making a more substantial appeals process available to students. I also ask him to make a final and concerted effort to expand the number of third level places in view of the numbers who were downgraded and who have missed out on their higher preference. Finally, for those who did the HPAT this year, that should be allowed to carry.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">The cornerstone of the predictive grade system was that the professional judgment of the teacher would be key. Teachers gave their professional opinion on the fairest grade an individual student would achieve if he or she sat the leaving certificate exam but that professional opinion seems to have been questioned by the State Examinations Commission. A full 17% of all grades were reduced. At higher level one in five of the estimated grades was lowered. How many grades, if any, were upgraded? How was it acceptable for the State Examinations Commission to refer to students' junior certificate results to determine his or her placing at leaving certificate? This disregards three or more years of students' development and the peers process is a farce. Some students had four or five of their subjects downgraded. How can this happen? The grades this year are up by 4.4% on last year which means that those who sat the leaving certificate last year, took a year out and applied for a college place this year are disadvantaged because the points for entry have increased.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">Standardisation is important. It is very difficult for individual students in their individual circumstances, and I acknowledge that. We do not have an ideal situation in that we did not have a written exam and we did not have the normal leaving certificate, which always has standardisation, although it is not as visible in the normal presentation of exam results every year. Because of Covid-19, we have had a unique situation, which has proved very challenging for all concerned. However, a hell of a lot of work went into this by technocrats, if I can use that phrase, or people who are used to this kind of modelling and standardisation, and consultation did take place with Deputies. Once anyone starts pulling a thread on this, the whole thing unfurls. In terms of the appeal, the Deputy wants to change it as we go along. I do not think that is possible or feasible.</p>

          <p eId="para_299">The Taoiseach spoke over and over again this morning about the Government's commitment to ramping up testing and tracing. I want to raise the issue of the provision of a Covid testing centre for Drogheda. As the Taoiseach knows, Drogheda is the largest town in Ireland but we are left without a Covid testing centre. The people of Drogheda and of south Louth who have been referred by their GP for a test have to travel to another town, and people who do not have transport - listen to this - have been told by the HSE to get the bus. These are people who have been referred by their GP because they are showing symptoms.</p>

People in Navan who have been identified as possibly having Covid have also been told they cannot get the test in Navan and have to travel, which does not make sense from any perspective. The idea of people with Covid circulating on the public transportation system or in any manner does not make sense. We are asking people to stay put as much as possible yet we are asking these people, who are most likely to have Covid, to travel for testing. It does not make sense.</p>

The question was whether the cross-border scheme would continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Many people have gone to Northern Ireland for hip, knee and, most importantly, cataract surgery. In the last year and a half, myself, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, Councillor Ben Dalton O'Sullivan and Councillor Danny Collins have taken over 2,000 people for eye-saving surgery. Fianna Fáil itself used the cross-border service in one of its election promotion videos. The answer I got from the Tánaiste at the time was that if there was a no-deal Brexit, legislation would be put in place to make sure the cross-border scheme would continue. Can the Taoiseach tell us if the legislation is now in place to continue the cross-border directive if we have a no-deal Brexit? He must not let thousands go blind in Cork and Kerry on his watch.</p>

The winter is approaching. It is now autumn and the flu season is upon us. What is the Taoiseach going to do? Is the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, going to intervene?

That is available now to deal with both the human resources requirements for the hospital system, particularly on the emergency side, and also other measures to reduce pressures on emergency departments.

It is a line that was uttered by plenty of the Taoiseach's candidates in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath over the course of the most recent general election. I would like to ask him what is his position now, considering that the planning process was moved forward substantially when the minister from the Taoiseach's sister party in the North last night granted planning permission in that jurisdiction. The fundamental problem remains in place, which is that public acceptance simply is not there. Those of us who have followed this since 2007, a period in which the North-South interconnector has been met by delay after delay, recognise that the reason for those delays is the lack of public acceptance. Will the Taoiseach ensure his own party's pre-general election position is adhered to, and we fundamentally review this issue and move towards the undergrounding of the North-South interconnector? </p>

          <from>Deputy Gino Kenny<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_356">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_357">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make provision for assistance in achieving a dignified and peaceful end of life to qualifying persons and related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I am introducing the Dying with Dignity Bill 2020 on behalf of Solidarity-People Before Profit. I do not do this in jubilation but with determination that this very personal issue is discussed openly and rationally. If enacted, this Bill will make legal and medical provision for achieving a peaceful end to life for those with a progressive and incurable terminal illness. Compassion, empathy and humanity should be at the heart of this debate. From the outset, the most important voice in the debate is that of the individual who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness. That individual should have a choice to make a fully conversant decision on how his or her condition progresses and concludes. The debate should not be framed as an alternative to palliative and hospice care in any way. This can be a very difficult conversation for a society. Whatever one's views on voluntary assisted dying, all views should be respected and listened to with mutual and collective respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> This Bill would not have been possible were it not for the incredible bravery of the late Marie Fleming. I never met Marie, but I know that if she were sitting in the Visitors Gallery now, she would be willing us on. Before Marie passed away in 2013, the Supreme Court stated in its ruling that there was no impediment in this Parliament to legislating for voluntary assisted dying. I also wish to mention Tom Curran, Marie Fleming's partner. Without Tom's guidance and input to this Bill, it would not have been possible. I also thank the former Independent Deputy, John Halligan, who introduced this Bill in 2015. I appeal to the public and fellow Deputies to give thought and reflection to this Bill over the coming weeks. If there is not a clear party or Government position to let this Bill progress, I ask the Taoiseach and party leaders to allow a free vote or vote of conscience on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> In the most profoundly difficult circumstances people should have a choice to have a dignified and peaceful end to their lives on their own terms when the pain and suffering become unbearable. Assisted dying is not about ending life but about ending suffering when a person no longer has the option of living. They have not made that decision. It has been taken out of their hands.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_365">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_366">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to ensure the provision of an equitable price for beef to farmers operating in that sector, in order to ensure that it is a sustainable means for them to earn a livelihood; and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">Many farmers in the country are finding it increasingly difficult to survive. Teagasc reckons that a third of farmers are currently making enough income off their farms to make a living. Another third of farmers are only able to survive because somebody is working away from the farm to supplement the farm income. A full third of farmers are making a loss and going into poverty. In fact, many of them are being pushed off the land. It is clear that the industry is not functioning at present. The industry is structured in the most anti-competitive way. It operates as an oligopoly. A small number of producers exert enormous control over the sector. The beef barons and producers can control every aspect of the market, such as the price and all the conditions of sale. In addition, supermarkets are making supernormal profits from the beef product. However, the primary producer in this country is getting a price which, in general, is below the cost of production. It is estimated that if the European grant funding for this sector were removed, most beef farmers would be making a significant loss.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Aontú is introducing a Bill which, for the first time, will force beef barons to pay a price that is either at or above the cost of production for a period of a year. It is to force the beef barons to the table to make a real and honest effort at negotiating a market that functions for everybody. The worst aspect of this market is the poverty it is engendering across the 130,000 beef farmers in the country. If we continue down the route of further concentration of power in the hands of the beef producers and supermarkets, there will not be a functional sector in the future. Successive Governments have presided over this issue. Indeed, the Fine Gael Chairman of the last agriculture committee said it was unreasonable for farmers to expect a price above the cost of production. It is an incredible statement from anybody whose job is to represent farmers. However, I have heard the current Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, echo those views, that it was not reasonable for farmers to expect a price above the cost of production. Any agriculture Minister with that view is likely to come to the same solution as has been achieved so far, which is a dysfunctional and broken market.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> This is not the only threat that farmers are facing. The Government has opened its arms to the Mercosur trade deal which will pave the way for cheap South American beef to be imported into the EU market. I will be speaking on climate change policy in a few hours. It is incredible that we are opting for seeing swathes of the Amazon rainforest felled so beef can be produced there and transported to Ireland to be a substitute for Irish beef, and for an Irish Government to preside over this.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> I travelled the country last year and I stood with pickets outside beef factories. I spoke to the small farmers. Some of them were threatened with injunctions by these beef barons because they were standing up for their right to try to achieve a better price. Indeed, I went to the High Court to defend these farmers. It was extraordinary to have beef barons level injunctions at farmers who are in poverty. One beef baron is Larry Goodman who earned €170 million in total last year and has assets worth €3.5 billion. He is tax resident in Luxembourg and pays an average tax of 2.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> The Taoiseach must see the grave injustice that exists in this market. The response of successive Governments has been to sit on their hands. This is the second time this Bill has come before the Dáil. On the previous occasion it fell when the previous Dáil fell. When I first brought it forward, Fianna Fáil said it would support the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Fianna Fáil candidates left, right and centre stood in all the different factories across the country when the farmers were out in force. The eyes of beef farmers across the country are now on Fianna Fáil Deputies to see what they will do with this Bill. Will they vote against it and stop it going any further, on to Third Stage, or will they grasp reform with two hands and run with it?</p>

            <p eId="para_393">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_394"> Under the terms of the Public Service Management Act 1997, Ministers and Ministers of State who regularly attend Cabinet meetings may request the approval of the Government to appoint special advisers. The Act also provides that other Ministers of State may also appoint a special adviser. The requirement for specialist policy input and advice is a matter for each individual Minister to consider, having regard to his or her area of responsibility and the support in place in the relevant Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_395"> I have begun the process of putting in place a range of appropriate advisory supports that I might need in my role as Taoiseach and head of the Government. The make-up of my team currently consists of a chief of staff at deputy secretary level, a deputy chief of staff at assistant secretary level, a part-time economic adviser at assistant secretary level and three special advisers at principal officer level.</p>
            <p eId="para_396"> In line with the provisions of the Public Service Management Act 1997, two special advisers may be assigned to the Government Chief Whip. There is currently one special adviser at principal officer level assigned to the office of the Government Chief Whip. Approval for the appointment of an adviser to the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs will be sought by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_397"> As outlined in the programme for Government, a number of reforms have been implemented to ensure openness and constructive co-operation within the Government. These include the establishment of an office of the Tánaiste and an office of the leader of the Green Party within the Department of the Taoiseach and located in Government Buildings. Special advisers in the office of the Tánaiste currently consist of a chief of staff at deputy secretary level and four special advisers, three at principal officer level and one at assistant principal level. Special advisers in the office of the leader of the Green Party consist of two joint chiefs of staff at assistant secretary level and three special advisers at principal officer level, two of whom are part-time. It should be noted that all of the above appointments are subject to Government approval over the coming weeks, following which relevant contracts, statements of qualifications and statements of relationships will be laid before the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_398">The Taoiseach's Department likes its advisers. I received a written response to a parliamentary question from the Taoiseach last week with details of 18 special advisers in his Department. The <i>Irish Independent</i> estimated yesterday that the cost of 15 of those advisers was at least €1.5 million a year. The Taoiseach's response did not, however, list the three Government press secretaries that are also being hired. If those three are added to the 18 special advisers, the total number of special advisers across the collective offices of the three party leaders in government is 21. That is a hell of a lot of advisers. If those costs are estimated on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, they come to approximately €2 million. Does the Taoiseach intend to hire any more advisers? There are 21 already. I am not even making a political point here. It is ridiculous. Is this the line? Is 21 enough? Do the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the leader of the Green Party intend to hire any more advisers?</p>
            <p eId="para_399"> Given that we are in a pandemic, I would have hoped that one of the totality of the 21 advisers would come from a public health background. I would not have any issue with that. It would have been desirable and useful and might have been helpful today. I would have thought that a good idea. Do any of the 18 special advisers listed, or the further three Government press secretaries, have any background in health whatsoever? I ask the Taoiseach to clarify that. It would be helpful if one of the 21 did, given where we are as a country. I am surprised that there is not one among the whole lot within the Government's collective <i>cabinets</i>, given the new profile of the Tánaiste. I might be wrong. I ask the Taoiseach to outline whether that is the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_400"> There are many Ministers of State wandering around the place wondering if they are going to get an adviser. I understand there is a bit of a dispute between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on this matter. Will there be a school of advisers or will the Ministers of State have individual ones? Those advisers have not been hired yet. The Government Chief Whip has one adviser but he is sitting at Cabinet. Will those who are sitting at Cabinet be left with just one adviser, or two, or will they be part of the school? In the response received from the Taoiseach, John Carroll is listed in the office of the Tánaiste. He has now been moved up to the role of Fine Gael general secretary. I congratulate him on that. Is there now a redundancy there as well? Those are my questions for the Taoiseach.</p>

            <p eId="para_405">He lambasted the Tánaiste weekly for reliance on PR and accused the then Government of being a Government of spin. It is quite extraordinary to have 21 advisers, including three press secretaries. On top of that, there was an announcement this week that a PR firm will be employed to mediate between NPHET, the public health advisers, and the Government. It will be a buffer which will dilute and finesse the message because the Government has got it so wrong and made such a mess of conveying the public health message that we now need a PR spin team to try to get it right. I put it to the Taoiseach that this is not the right way to go about things. If one wants to instil confidence, clarity and certainty about public health measures, having a load of spin doctors and advisers who specialise in giving advice but may not have any particular expertise in the areas of substance that people want to know about is not the way forward. The Government needs to listen to people on the ground who really know and engage with them more. It would not have to spend so much on advisers or PR people if it listened to the front-line healthcare workers, nurses, laboratory people, doctors or taxi drivers who are out there. It should listen to the people on the ground who actually understand how things work on the ground. Then it might gain clarity about how to convey messages that would bring the public with it. The Government is compounding the mistakes it has made over the last number of weeks by surrounding itself with buffers, PR people and specialist advisers.</p>

            <p eId="para_406">The moral of this story is that even legions of advisers cannot save the Government when it is clueless about what it is doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_407">With 21 advisers - God almighty - are they advising the Taoiseach or is it that he is not listening to the advice? I am unclear. I have never seen so much incoherence emanate from any Administration. The bar is high for bad government, but the Government is up there. It has exceeded all expectations in a way that is dramatic. What are the 21 advisers costing the taxpayer? What are we to make of reports that the acting Chief Medical Officer provides separate briefings to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste? What is the reason for that? Is it more of this rivalry? Have the Taoiseach's advisers advised him that that is not smart or good government?</p>

            <p eId="para_408">It is extraordinary the degree to which Deputies will come to the House and take whatever they read in the newspaper as fact, as the Deputy has just done. I thought she was paying attention to the press conference this morning, but she clearly was not because that question was asked. There are no separate briefings for the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. As the Tánaiste stated, he was briefed once by Dr. Ronan Glynn in the past while, at a half-hour session, and then he had another briefing with the head of the modelling advisory group. There is nothing wrong with that. We have both been briefed jointly, as members of the Covid-19 Cabinet sub-committee, by the acting Chief Medical Officer. This is a non-story, yet the Deputy comes in here and tries to elevate to something that it is not-----</p>

            <p eId="para_413"> Moreover, the Sinn Féin Party is no stranger to special advisers. It invented the whole concept to an extraordinary degree in the Northern Ireland Executive, where it has SPADs, as the Deputy calls them, all over the place. We saw the trouble they got the party into in respect of the debacle over the fuel scheme and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_414"> Third, the Deputy has some neck to talk to people about incoherence when Sinn Féin as a party has been in denial for so long about the blatant breaching of guidelines that happened at the late Bobby Storey's funeral. I ask the Deputy to look at how long it took her to apologise for that, yet she attacks everybody else for incoherence and for being in denial. Everyone else in this jurisdiction was accountable for that kind of breach. The Deputy was not accountable and Sinn Féin was not accountable. It is one rule for Sinn Féin and different rules for everybody else in the House. That is the level of incoherence and denial that the Deputy practises, and she is in no position to lecture anybody on these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_417"> To respond to Deputy Kelly, the concept of special advisers is not new. We have three parties, and an office has been established for the leader of each party within that to ensure that the Government can get the programme for Government implemented. That is the origin of special advisers, which the Labour Party, to its credit, brought in when Dick Spring became Tánaiste after the 1992 general election. </p>

            <p eId="para_419">He was the first to bring in a special office of the Tánaiste, which is what is happening on this occasion. I think it is important and it will happen into the future, of that I have no doubt. It happened in the previous Government, where Independent Ministers had special advisers. The concept and the numbers of special advisers are not new. As a three-party Government, the respective parties are very focused and the advisers' role is to deliver the programme for Government issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_420"> While I do not want to go into the details of individuals, given that they are entitled to their private lives, the chief of staff has a well-known background in health, having worked in industrial relations at the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and on the front line prior to that. She was also an adviser at the Department of Health for three and a half years, so she is very well versed in health matters. Nevertheless, the acting Chief Medical Officer is the key, along with NPHET, for public health advice, and that is the way it should be in terms of presenting advice to the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_421"> To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett, I have always accepted the need for advisers in government, which is why, as Opposition leader, I never focused on special advisers, whether with the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, or when the Tánaiste was Taoiseach. I focused on the political communications unit, and had fundamental issues with its structure and how Parliament and the Government should operate. The Government has not hired a public relations firm for the Government-wide plan. The Department of Health has hired advice for public health dimensions, but the Government as a whole has not. There has been a Government communications programme in respect of the pandemic from its commencement, with all the various advertisements that people will have seen on the television, in the newspapers and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_422"> We do listen to people on the ground, consistently, and we engage with them. I do that and have done so all my life as a politician. It is not unique to people in opposition. All Deputies do their best to do that. We will continue to do that and to engage with people.</p>

            <p eId="para_432">I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_433"> The Cabinet committee on health was established by a Government decision on 6 July and held its first meeting on 28 July. It will meet again in the coming weeks. It will oversee implementation of programme for Government commitments in respect of health, receive detailed reports on identified policy areas and consider the implementation of health reforms, including Sláintecare and the development of mental health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_434"> In addition to the meetings of the full Cabinet and of Cabinet committees, I meet Ministers individually to focus on different issues. I regularly meet the Minister for Health to discuss priorities in the area of health and in particular our management and response to Covid-19. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented interruption to normal healthcare activity, with both community and acute settings affected. Resuming health and social care services, and building our capacity and capability for the pressures of winter 2020-2021 and beyond, will be particularly challenging in a way that the health service has not experienced in living memory. </p>
            <p eId="para_435"> Earlier today, I launched our medium-term plan, Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19, which frames Ireland's approach to managing and living with Covid-19 for the coming six to nine months. It aims to bring some clarity to help everyone to plan over the medium term. The plan contains a framework for restrictive measures, which is a risk management strategy for the next six to nine months. It is designed to allow individuals, families, businesses and services better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures the Government might introduce to stop escalation of the transmission of the disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_436"> In the context of the health service, the plan sets out our approach and priorities for managing and living with Covid in a range of areas, including, among other measures, prevention of infection and protection of vulnerable groups, health system response and resilience, and the continued resumption of public service delivery, including non-Covid health and social care. It is important to recognise that many vital services have continued throughout the pandemic, ensuring that priority care needs were addressed and the most vulnerable protected even at the height of this crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_437"> A range of initiatives have been developed, and as these continue to be rolled out in the coming weeks and months, we will see further service resumption and increased capacity throughout the community and acute hospital system. This includes implementing new initiatives, new ways of working and eHealth solutions to keep people safe and out of the acute hospital system, such as ePharmacy, ePrescribing and virtual clinics. Today, the Cabinet agreed to allocate a record €600 million for the 2020 winter initiative to ensure that our health service has the capacity and resources needed to deal with what is forecast to be a particularly challenging few months.</p>

            <p eId="para_438">I was at the taxi drivers' protest during Leaders' Questions, so I have not fully studied the roadmap, but I want to know what the strategy is, as do the people.</p>
            <p eId="para_439">Specialists in public health, immunology, infectious diseases and so on are saying that we should be pursuing a zero Covid strategy as against what appears to be, in this plan, a roller-coaster strategy, going up and down and up and down, with nobody knowing quite where it ends. Has this committee considered a zero Covid strategy, which I stress is not about a return to lockdowns but precisely a return to normality by the putting in place of resources and systems, in particular the testing and tracing regime, such that we can really chase the virus and isolate it? This is a clear objective that the people can get behind and understand in terms of where we are heading. Connected to this is the question of permanent healthcare capacity. The capacity of testing and tracing has a lot to do with permanent recruitment. Many of those engaged in testing and tracing were redeployed from elsewhere. What is the envisaged number of staff required to be recruited permanently and engaged in testing and tracing to get to the state-of-the-art testing and tracing regime? What are the plans in terms of permanent increases in capacity for ICU and the health service generally in terms of recruitment because it is trained people who are needed?</p>
            <p eId="para_440"> In terms of public health restrictions, would it not be best to have in place a hotline for workers in employment who are worried about encroachment on health and safety guidelines and so on such that they have a means of reporting to the HSE and a system that is responsive?</p>

            <p eId="para_441">Earlier, I asked the Taoiseach about travel restrictions and the statement in the plan that those living in Dublin should be encouraged to limit their travel etc. The Taoiseach is probably aware at this stage that the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, said the opposite on the "News At One". In regard to the elderly and those who waited for the peak season to be over and have booked a staycation for this weekend but who live in Dublin, what is the Government advice? It is an honest question. My colleagues and I, and I presume other Deputies, have received texts on this issue. What are such people to do? They are not in level 2 and are not in level 3.</p>
            <p eId="para_442"> What is the difference between this committee and the Cabinet Covid committee in terms of responsibilities? I welcome the €600 million but strange as it may seem to say this it may not be enough. On the winter plan, I ask the Taoiseach to comment on a number of issues. I understand the plan will be launched on Thursday. Perhaps the Taoiseach will confirm if that is correct. The situation in some areas needs particular attention. Limerick University Hospital is the topic on which I have probably spoken most in this House. The situation there has been ongoing for a decade. As things stand, the hospital is at crisis point today. We need a plan for this hospital and for Cork University Hospital, where the Taoiseach will know there are issues as well. The mid-west in particular traditionally has had huge problems so we need to focus our efforts there.</p>
            <p eId="para_443"> There are a few other issues I would like to highlight. The Taoiseach might come back to me, as he mentioned earlier, on the vaccine. We need to get other screening back up and running, including BreastCheck, otherwise we will have delayed issues. I have continuously raised the issue of people with disabilities, which the Taoiseach will acknowledge. Our planning for the coming months needs to be elderly and disability proofed. I acknowledge the plan to recruit in regard to the testing regime. It is crazy, as pointed out by my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, to have therapists, etc., doing the work which others could be doing. For example, it could be done by people who are retired or by students.</p>

            <p eId="para_444">The general perception of people is that there is a lot of confusion around the public heath advice. There is a reason for this, namely, the public health advice is not followed consistently, but instead the interests of private profit are allowed to interfere and interact with it. I am concerned the plan for living with Covid-19 is being institutionalised with the establishment of the Covid-19 oversight group, which effectively functions as a buffer as I understand it between NPHET and the Government. This group receives the public health advice from NPHET, which works it out in terms of the impact economically, socially, etc., and there the interests of private profit can come to bear. I also have a concern that this group is going to delay the process in that it is due to meet weekly and then report to NPHET, which will then have to pass on that advice to Government at a time when speed and movement in terms of action on public health is necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_445"> The message of individual responsibility is not the right message. What is required is collective responsibility and the Government needs to take public action. At the heart of that action is the testing and tracing system. By way of comparison, Denmark, which has a similar population to Ireland, is now testing close to 200,000 people per week. In Ireland, 75,000 tests were carried out last week and a few weeks ago fewer than 60,000 were being carried out. In Denmark, there are free testing facilities publicly available, with testing available to anybody who wants it, including at the airports, yet here we are not even testing everybody in a classroom when there is a known Covid case. It is absolute madness. We are six months into a highly contagious pandemic and the Government is still rationing testing because it is trying to do it on the cheap. We had the opportunity to get ahead of the virus over the summer months. Will the resources be applied to bring our testing and tracing regime up to scratch?</p>

            <p eId="para_446">I want to ask the Taoiseach about the ICU beds in our system. The Minister for Health confirmed in recent days that we have 255 ICU beds in the system, which is half the European average per head of population and 15% of the ICU bed capacity in Germany, for example, We are an absolute outlier in this critical resource. In 2009, an independent report found that the public health service needed to increase ICU bed capacity by 45% yet since then capacity has fallen rather than grown. There is confusion within the hospital system as to what exactly the Government contingency plan is for ICU care in terms of Covid cases and non-Covid cases. We need a permanent increase in the baseline of ICU bed provision and, of course, the staff to service those beds. When will the Government publish a plan to increase ICU capacity to ensure the very urgent care for Covid and non-Covid patients?</p>

            <p eId="para_448">It is a matter of concern to me that anti-face mask protests have been organised across the country in recent weeks. I believe that those who are anti-masks and organising these marches are anti-workers because wearing a mask protects the worker behind the counter in the shop, the driver on the bus and so on. These marches, in most cases, have been organised by the far right. They have tried to build a base on racism and on homophobia and they are now trying to do it on the basis of frustration with coronavirus restrictions. They are being helped by some of the actions of the political establishment. Golf-gate created anger which swelled the marches.</p>

            <p eId="para_450">Can the Taoiseach report on any initiatives from the Cabinet sub-committee in terms of promoting face masks? I believe there needs to be a mass campaign of worker activists on the left to challenge this development.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_247">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_451">On face masks, let us give the people of Ireland credit. Everybody in here talks about confusion. There was no confusion among the people when we brought in regulations to make mandatory the wearing of masks on public transport and in shops. As Taoiseach, I pushed hard to make that happen. The compliance rate is 90%. Last April, only 16% of people were wearing masks. That is the answer to the far right. I agree with most of what Deputy Barry said in terms of the far right. The Government has nothing to do with it. What those involved are doing is wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_452"> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of the zero Covid strategy. That is not our position. We do not agree with that strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_453">It involves severe lockdowns and let us not pretend it does not. The acting Chief Medical Officer has been very clear that it is not his view or that of NPHET that it is a realistic approach or strategy. Our strategy is to live with Covid, keep people safe, protect health, maintain economic resilience and jobs and restore public services with regard to keeping schools, crèches and higher education institutions open. We are seeking to restore health services while considering quality of life issues around the arts and sports and trying to keep games and live performances going as best we can within the restrictions. We want to support community well-being on the ground as well as mental health, which is critical. That will increasingly become an issue as the pandemic continues and evolves.</p>
            <p eId="para_454"> Lab capacity is an issue with testing. The numbers in the plan are to have approximately 3,000 people employed for testing purposes, including swabbers, contact tracers and the many more people behind the scenes who help in the administration of the work. There is a clinical need for call one, giving people results, and public health authorities insist on that. I take Deputy Kelly's point, which I have made to the Health Service Executive, HSE, that we need a permanent workforce and that we should not redeploy from within. That is how the process started and we came from a very low base when the pandemic started. I consistently made the point and it is now happening, with recruitment under way, with more people coming to the contact tracing side in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_455"> The plan has been elderly-proofed, as it were, and we respect the elderly as, arguably, these are the cohort of people who have adhered most to the guidelines issued by public health authorities. The advice from NPHET at this stage is to encourage people in Dublin not to travel outside Dublin if possible. That is what NPHET has said at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_456"> The differences between the Covid-19 and health committees are clear. The Covid-19 committee deals with all aspects of Covid-19, and that is why the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform attend the Covid-19 committee, along with the Minister for Health and ministerial advisers. It is exclusively about all aspects of Covid-19 and it would have co-ordinated the plan published today. The health committee deals with broader health matters, including the winter initiative, as well as screening, health capacity and so on.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_458">The Deputy stated "interests of private profit are allowed to interfere" but that would be the antithesis of what is envisaged. The oversight committee is to be headed by the Secretary General of the Department and it involves other Departments. This is to ensure the process is practical. I will give an example. There was a furore in the House when NPHET advised we should enforce a provision to allow people to enter people's homes to control the numbers in a household. Everybody opposed such a suggestion, saying that civil liberties were at risk. There must be some filtering of advice in terms of how we make it possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_459"> With a week to go to the opening of schools, there was advice out of the blue from NPHET that we should go ahead with public transport at 50% capacity. The Government could not accept that immediately, and it did not, but we said we would try to follow that advice over time. We had been working with public health authorities on protocols to bring children safely to schools, including the identification of seat numbers for kids and all that. There needs to be some fine-tuning of advice when it comes to the practical implementation of it. We must co-ordinate Departments to ensure they are linked with stakeholders.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_251">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_467">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 12, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_468"> The Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment has been established and first met on 8 July. It has met on a total of four occasions, most recently on 2 September. The Cabinet committee will meet regularly but the date of the next meeting has not yet been confirmed. The membership of the committee comprises the Taoiseach; the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment; the Minister with responsibility for climate action, communications networks and transport; the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister with responsibility for media, tourism, arts, culture, sport and the Gaeltacht. Other Ministers or Ministers of State will attend when required.</p>
            <p eId="para_469"> The Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment is responsible for matters relating to the economy and investment. Its initial focus was on developing the July jobs stimulus. This was a package of more than €7 billion of measures announced by the Government on 23 July. It is designed to stimulate a jobs-based recovery to build economic confidence while continuing to manage the impact of Covid-19. It includes measures to extend income and employment supports to affected individuals in companies to help people get back to work, training or education, and to build confidence among businesses in supporting them through the months ahead. It is to invest in jobs-rich infrastructure and projects in every part of the country and in areas of future growth, such as the green economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_470"> Matters relevant to the transport sector may arise, as required, at a number of Cabinet committees, most notably the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment. They can also arise at the Cabinet committee on environment and climate change. Matters relating to the economy and transport are regularly discussed at full Cabinet meetings, where all formal decisions are made.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_252">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_471">I have questioned the Taoiseach and appealed to him extensively, including today, on matters relating to taxi drivers and the public transport system. As we discussed earlier, there was a major protest involving taxi drivers today. The Taoiseach has expressed sympathy but has not given a clear commitment. When will he make a decision on the key demands being made by taxi drivers, because they are desperate? They are incurring debts and have virtually no income. They do not know whether to stay on the reducing pandemic unemployment payment or go back to work, where they cannot possibly make a living, and lose all that payment. Insurance costs, repayments, licence renewals fees, car maintenance, fuel and all these costs and debts meanwhile are clocking up. When will the Taoiseach make a decision on their central request, which is for an income subsidy to allow them a baseline income on top of which they can earn money, knowing that until we have health restrictions lifted, they will not have the capacity to fully make their living. The same question applies to the arts, music and live entertainment workers. They need to get an answer to this central request.</p>
            <p eId="para_472"> With regard to the taxi drivers, there are some measures that would not even cost anything. Stopping the issuing of new taxi licences would cost the Government nothing, as would extending the ten-year replacement rule to 12 years. Getting rid of the taxi advisory committee, which is completely discredited, and replacing it with a national taxi transport forum, with proper representation for taxi drivers so that they could actually be heard from, would cost nothing. When will we get answers to such matters?</p>
            <p eId="para_473"> The 50% capacity rule on public transport, along with the fact that many people do not want to use it because they are frightened, has led to a problem and we need to increase capacity in public transport dramatically. We have some of that capacity with private buses and our taxi friends, who have no work. What will we do to increase public transport capacity given the 50% restriction on capacity?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_253">
            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_474">Similarly, I want to raise with the Taoiseach the lack of pace with which his Government has responded to the economic crisis. Deputy Boyd Barrett quite correctly raises the case of the taxi drivers, but I can cite a more general example in the credit guarantee scheme, which represents a vital lifeline for business as the economic crisis has deepened. We made the case for the removal of the 50% portfolio cap for this guarantee scheme for small and medium enterprises a full two months before the Government relented and adopted our policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_475"> By the way, the credit guarantee scheme came to be in Ireland months after similar schemes were introduced and up and running in other European jurisdictions. Similarly, the stay and spend tax refund scheme is clumsy, awkward and falls well short of what is required for tourism and hospitality. We are second only to Spain in terms of jobs losses in the second quarter of this year. We have levels of youth unemployment that are eye-watering and terrifying, and I see no sign of any response or thought-out plan for that. It is very disappointing. If the Government deals with unemployment and particularly youth unemployment in the same slow, clumsy manner that has become the hallmark of its economic response, we will be in very big trouble.</p>

          <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_254">
            <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_476">I will raise two matters with the Taoiseach.</p>
            <p eId="para_477">The first pertains to the redundancy law which was extended today. With this law the Government has effectively allowed companies to make workers redundant while refusing to allow workers who have been laid off to invoke redundancy to get the payments to which they are entitled. Instead these workers are being left in limbo. They cannot get their redundancy payments from the company, but they are told by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to look for a new job or be cut off from the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment. Will the Minister intervene to ensure workers get their entitlements without any further delay?</p>
            <p eId="para_478"> The second issue I want to raise is the mistreatment of workers by Aer Lingus. The Taoiseach might be aware that Aer Lingus is currently paying its workers only 30% of their basic wages. These experienced workers with families to feed and rents to pay are expected to live on less than the dole. Some workers have been left with as little as €150 a week to live on while the company is bailed out by the public purse. In recent weeks I have been contacted by several of those workers. They have spoken about the impossible situation they are in and their worries about how they will survive on these poverty wages. The company has now told these workers not to reach out to Deputies, speak out on social media or talk about the situation they are facing. The rules of the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme must be changed to ensure all companies in receipt of State support pay their workers decent wages.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Kelly<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_479">The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform gave an interview to the <i>Business Post</i> over the weekend, which I presume the Taoiseach read. Is the Taoiseach ruling out increases to income or wealth tax in the coming budget? Has he ruled out increases to social welfare payments or the Christmas bonus? What will be the size of the national recovery fund, and will this be new money? We do not know because we have not had a statement from the Taoiseach. To what use will it be put?</p>
            <p eId="para_480"> The deficit is expected to be €30 billion. At the end of August it was €9.5 billion. The difference is more than €20 billion, some €5 billion a month. I do not know how realistic all of this is. There is a huge lack of information from the Government. What will the real impacts of this on current and capital funding be? As I am sure the Taoiseach heard, his partner in government, the Green Party, has announced that the M20 will not happen in the next five years. Is that accurate? Is there any truth in recent commentary on the national children's hospital project? What is the situation there? What are the plans to deal with this deficit, and how will it affect future spending to which the Government has already committed?</p>

            <from>Deputy Jennifer Whitmore<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_481">I would like to ask a quick question about the Covid-19 plan which I am not sure is allowable. There are now restrictions on people living in Dublin. They must limit their travel outside of County Dublin. I come from Wicklow. A huge number of my constituents commute to Dublin, as do many others from Meath and Kildare. Are there any restrictions on people entering Dublin or does the plan only place limits on people leaving it?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_482">Many Aer Lingus workers have been reduced from 50% to 30% of their wages and are unable to claim social welfare payments. People with families and mortgages have been left to survive on between €100 and €200 a week. Can the Taoiseach imagine the resulting stress and the toll on people's mental health? Uproar followed and the Government has now assured workers that payments have been sanctioned, but I want to ask the Taoiseach if this is really the case. Reports of workers being refused are still coming in. Finally, I would like the Taoiseach to comment on the fact that Aer Lingus is not paying workers the full value of the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_258">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_483">Deputy Boyd Barrett was first with his query on taxi drivers, the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme. I have spoken to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. Certain social protection measures allow her to help out people in certain sectors such as the arts, and she has been in contact with them. As I said to the Deputy earlier, a broader approach is under consideration. That work is being carried on between the relevant Ministers in preparation for the budget. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will be meeting representatives of taxi drivers. I take the Deputy's point about measures that do not cost money but have wider implications. He referred to suspending the issuing of taxi licences. We have extended the period of renewal from ten years to 12 years. The 50% rule concerning public transport is a public health measure. Buses do not grow on trees. They are not easy to procure. Huge efforts are underway at the moment to procure buses for school routes while complying with public health advice, but that takes time. The 50% rule regarding public transport still has a very strong public health basis. We have engaged with NPHET on this, and it is of the view that the rule should be maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_484"> In response to Deputy Kelly's queries about the budget, I note that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will issue statements tomorrow on overall budgetary strategy pertaining to deficits and expenditure. Tax receipts have been buoyant, which reflects the progressive nature of the tax system but also shows that those on lower incomes have lost out more. Tax returns, particularly corporate tax receipts, have remained solid, which is helping the overall financial situation. That said, there has been an unprecedented intervention in the economy. People who use words like "awkward" and "clumsy" need to get real. The scale of the intervention is anything but awkward or clumsy. The Government has only been in place for 11 or 12 weeks. The temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme has been extended to April. The Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment has been extended, and the rates are still relative to what people were earning before Covid. It has also been opened to new entrants. There is a suite of enterprise measures such as the restart grant scheme, supports and tax measures. This will benefit lots of people involved in enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_485"> Deputy Murphy raised the issue of redundancy payments. There is an issue here that we must all face. Our overarching priority is to protect employment. If redundancy claims were triggered straight away, many enterprises could fold overnight. The whole agenda during this pandemic is to get as many enterprises as possible through it intact so that after Covid-19 they can grow again and employ their existing workforce and more workers if possible. That is a laudable objective in itself, but there are limits to it and the intervention has only been extended to November. The budget will include further financial intervention to support certain sectors of the economy. We are going to assist particularly those sectors that will not enjoy the income levels they would have enjoyed if the public health advice was otherwise.</p>
            <p eId="para_486"> Deputy Kelly mentioned the Green Party. I understand that the Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, website already referred to a five-year timeline for the M20, including the planning and design stages. That is where it was. People deliberately distort certain statements but that is the factual position. I remember checking it during the negotiation of the programme for Government. That was the timeline on the TII website-----</p>

          <p eId="para_492">Reports have emerged that soldiers are paid between €2 per hour and €3 per hour at the weekend, which is completely illegal and shameful. It is not acceptable that soldiers could earn more working in a shop than they do in the Defence Forces. The Department of Defence continually fails to use its full budget allocation as it has fewer staff than expected. There are currently 8,600 enlisted soldiers, which is 900 fewer than expected, yet the Department will not pay those soldiers enough to live on. The Rural Independent Group supports calls for the establishment of a special commission to examine all aspects of the Defence Forces, including enlistment and re-enlistment.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> The members of the Defence Forces have families. Many of them have children and wives or husbands. They are our protectors. They protect us and this country, as do members of An Garda Síochána. They do significant work around the country, such as in respect of the ongoing environmental issues which are worsening year on year. Whom did we call on for help when Storm Ophelia arrived? Who were the first people called into action? The emergency services, including the Army, were called on to help us. Members of the Defence Forces, along with other front-line services, were the first people out, at all hours of the night, to help us. The State rewards them with €2 or €3 extra per hour in overtime for so protecting us.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> When the President of the United States came to Ireland, the Army and the Garda were called on to assist. Members of the Army were sent out with packed lunches and rations and our gardaí were fed. As Deputies know, anyone who calls to an Irish person's house is fed well. The Irish have great respect for people. The gardaí ended up having to feed the members of the Army because there were no provisions allowed for the latter as they carried out their duties. That was wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> Equality must start here. Our front-line services should be treated the way we would like to be treated. They looked after us in terms of Covid-19. It is now up to us to look after them. Members of the Defence Forces need equality with other front-line workers. They are our front-line workers and protectors. It is up to the Government to intervene and protect the Army and, in turn, let it protect us. We cannot allow the current circumstances to continue. Equality for all must be respected. I call on the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, to intervene on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">The Fine Gael Party has something against the Army. It destroyed a wonderful tradition in Clonmel, County Tipperary. For generations - for centuries - there was an Army barracks in Clonmel, but Fine Gael just wiped it away, as it did with many other things. I will fast-forward to Fine Gael's current treatment of the Defence Forces. I note that it will have received the reports on the Defence Forces by now. We have seen another programme for Government with a promise to establish an independent commission. The Minister knows well the situation with the Army and he was at the fore of the talks on the programme for Government. If he had any interest in the Army, he should have ensured it got proper respect, acknowledgement and, above all, pay and conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> He knows well the two fiascos that occurred earlier this year when the return of troops who had spent six months serving abroad was delayed by a month and subsequently delayed by another couple of weeks. A similar situation occurred three years ago. The Government stated that it was a paperwork problem. The soldiers' families and loved ones, be they wives or husbands, were awaiting their return. First communions and other family events were delayed. That had never happened previously in the history of the State. We have a proud tradition of recognition of Army service that goes back to our troops serving in the Congo and elsewhere in the world on United Nations duties, but serving soldiers have been abandoned abroad three times in recent years. We did not even have a plane to bring them home. I think the Taoiseach stated that there was no carrier to bring them home. That is a Dad's Army situation. The way Fine Gael treated the Army is disgraceful. I know it is the party of the big shots and the landed gentry, but few would have thought it would treat members of the Army, people on whom we depend, in such a manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> I recently got a call from the HSE about an outbreak at Walsh Mushrooms in Golden. Who were the first people on the scene? The Garda, assisted by the Army, were the first there to put up Army camps and tents in which to carry out testing. The Defence Forces are called on for floods, as Deputy O'Donoghue stated, as well as storms and snow storms. While I was involved with the Army in Clonmel there were many occasions when it cleared snow and brought help to people or rescued them from floods. The town was flooded often enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> The Government does not respect the Army. The former Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Kehoe, ridiculed members of the Defence Forces and made little of them. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, heard the figures referred to by Deputy O'Donoghue. I remember reading a report that members of the Defence Forces were treated like refugees while they were minding President Trump on his visit to Ireland last year. They did not even have enough to eat. That is shocking. Their pay, compared with that of gardaí, is downright disgraceful. It all stems from a lack of respect for Óglaigh na hÉireann, our proud Defence Forces. The Government has seen what it has done. It has just divided and conquered. It moved some of the troops who were stationed in Clonmel to Kilkenny and others to Limerick. More of the troops left the Army. The number of members who are leaving is staggering.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> I wish to offer my sincere congratulations to Tipperary woman Roberta O'Brien, whom I am sure the Minister knows well. She is the first woman in the history of the Naval Service to achieve the rank of commander. It is a wonderful achievement for her. I know her personally, and I wish her and her family well. It is a credit to the entire family, including her father, William, and her late mother, that this powerful woman from the famed Glen of Aherlow, has gone on to achieve what she has achieved. She has given sterling service in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> However, as the Minister is aware, we cannot even man the naval vessels that we have. He has been told that by PDFORRA and others. We do not have the personnel to man the vessels. A staggering 82% of those who left the Army in the past year did so because of conditions and disrespect. Of course, those who served at the Battle of Jadotville in the Congo have not been recognised for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> The Government does not respect the Army but we may need it very soon. We do not know the day or the hour when we will need it. The members of the Defence Forces need equipment, proper training and all the other resources they should have. They are not looking for anything out of the ordinary. They are expected to be ready, willing and able when they are needed. Thankfully, they are always available to serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> I refer to the strength of the Defence Forces. Young men used to join the Army as a career. I heard a radio programme recently which reported on members of the Defence Forces who are leaving in order to try to get into other sections of the public service because they cannot survive. The women have come up here many times. I refer to the housewives and homemakers - I am not being sexist - who have begged us to treat our troops with respect. Members of the Army cannot lobby on their own behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> I am glad that Deputy Berry is here because he is an excellent advocate for the Army. Its members need to be advocated for. Any Government that has treated them with such total disrespect should hang its head in shame. Big Phil the enforcer - where is he now? - wiped away our barracks in Clonmel and many other things as well. He forced through Irish Water, Uisce Éireann, which is another disaster. The people of Clonmel, elsewhere in south Tipperary and beyond will not forgive the Government for a long time. Fine Gael has not got a Deputy elected in the area in the past two elections. Why would a Fine Gael candidate be elected there? Fine Gael destroyed the dignified and well-earned respect that those soldiers had. One could eat one's dinner off the ground in any part of the barracks complex but now there are weeds, bushes and briars growing all around it. It is a sad sight in the middle of our town. Its gates are locked. When the alarms on the barracks go off at night, they can ring for a fortnight. We cannot get the builder or whoever owns it or the security company responsible for its maintenance to turn them off. It is a sad state of affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">We would see the tricolour flying proudly there and the Army drilling and going up the Nire Valley for scheduled training, but now it is closed and covered in cobwebs and dirt. Above all, the Government should respect the Army personnel and recruit the proper numbers so that we will have a proper Army. The Minister should look into that immediately, and not talk about another commission.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">Given the week that is in, I will focus on the Siege of Jadotville, which raged for four days 51 years ago this week. It was a stand-out moment in this country's proud history of overseas peacekeeping duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> In Longford-Westmeath, we are especially proud of our association with this chapter in our peacekeeping history. Fifteen soldiers from County Longford and a further 22 from Westmeath featured in Jadotville. Indeed, the two counties accounted for more than 20% of the complement of soldiers there. One of those who featured was Michael Tighe, a Longford town man. He is currently recuperating from surgery, but he has been at the forefront of trying to get the recognition that he and his fellow soldiers have long been denied.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> Regrettably, it has been decided that the surviving soldiers will not be awarded the bravery medals recommended by their commanding officer, Colonel Pat Quinlan. The soldiers have in recent times received many honours and accolades as a result of the campaign headed up by the late colonel's son, Leo, but, alas, they have been denied the individual medals for bravery which were recommended for them following the siege in the Congo in 1961.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> During the siege, which was subsequently dramatised in a Netflix movie, 150 Irish peacekeepers with no battle experience held out for an unprecedented five days against 3,000 mercenaries and local militia without suffering a single fatality. Alas, for years afterwards, Colonel Quinlan and his men were derided in Ireland because they had eventually surrendered. Sadly, several of the soldiers who featured in Jadotville subsequently died by suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> After achieving recognition for the achievements of his father and the men in recent years, Leo Quinlan has continued to campaign for them to be awarded the distinguished service medal or military medal for gallantry - the two highest honours afforded to anybody in the proud Irish Defence Forces. He has thankfully found the original list of recommendations made by his father after the battle which put forward 33 men for these awards. Eight of those men are still alive, including our own Michael Tighe.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> I appreciate and understand the Department's position in that both medals are time bound - two years in the case of the military medal for gallantry, MMG, and four years in the case of the distinguished service medal, DSM. The Department also makes the point that it feels that the issue was comprehensively dealt with in 1965. However, that is not a view shared by many members of the public, and especially in Longford-Westmeath where we have a great tradition and affinity with those who featured in the Siege of Jadotville.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> The Minister himself is on record as having said that he will consider any new information to support a reconsideration to award the medals. Equally, I know the Minister is incredibly proud of this nation's record in peacekeeping, overseas duty and the Jadotville Congo era, which is a hugely important part of our military history. I also understand that there is a precedent that will enable the Minister with responsibility for defence to order the rules on time limits to be waived in certain circumstances and I earnestly hope that the Minister will give this due consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_513">I am sharing time with Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Buckley.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> I welcome what the previous speakers have said. I would like to add my voice of support for medals and recognition of those who fought at the Siege of Jadotville. It is necessary that we give due respect to our Defence Force.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> In a previous sitting in this House when the Minister did not have responsibility for defence, I requested that he would make contact with the then Minister with responsibility for defence on the basis of getting the Air Corps helicopter to deal with a number of serious fires that we have in the Cooley Peninsula over the summer. Luckily, that happened and it worked out well. I thank both the Minister and the Air Corps.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> It was said by others in this Chamber that from time to time when we face great difficulties we call on the Defence Forces. The Minister himself visited Dundalk to see off a number of soldiers to whom I wish the best of luck who are on the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in the Golan Heights and are carrying out necessary peacekeeping operations. I cannot but add my voice to what many Members have said in relation to the ongoing travesty that is the case of pay for members of the Defence Forces. We have all heard the horror stories. It is not only the pay. It is the limited duty payment. In many cases, sometimes families of the military have to engage the services of Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the form of social welfare. I have heard many soldiers who had entered into the service in Dundalk tell others that it is not now the same option, even for them. They would talk about the lack of pay. They would also say that the pension position is not as good as it was previously. We have a serious issue here that we must deal with otherwise we will not be able to retain the soldiers that we have. This is a necessity. I would ask that the Minister put the difficulty of soldiers' pay at the top of his priorities in defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> The Minister has another brief. In a previous incarnation, in a time gone by, which none of us would wish to see again, we would have had soldiers engaged in operations on the Border. On the previous occasion I spoke to the Minister in relation to the issue of Brexit, we had not quite seen the legislation but the UK Internal Market Bill is all that was promised in relation to a breach of international law and circumvention of the Irish protocol and the withdrawal agreement. I welcome many of the statements that the Minister has made. He has been utterly forthright. We need to ensure the European Union and the Government remain forthright. Sometimes we are second guessing what the British Prime Minister, Mr. Boris Johnson, is at. Other than it being reprehensible, the Bill gives Mr. Johnson no creditability as a negotiator. However, we need to ensure the net result are the best mitigations possible in relation to Brexit. If we are to believe what certain sections of the British Conservative Party and Mr. Johnson are saying, I call on the Government to look at the possibility that we could face a nightmare situation where they cut a hole in the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol and that whatever protections anyone believed are there are no longer there. We could be looking at a disaster. It is a disastrous situation, particularly in regard to places outside Dundalk, such as Faughart where it meets Jonesborough, where the Concession Road meets the Castleblayney Road, and where Culloville and Crossmaglen meet the Shela area. We have numerous Border crossings. We have, as I stated previously, a particular history, and we cannot tolerate any possibility of a hard border infrastructure and we need to ensure that, whatever happens, this is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> I was quite happy to hear members of other political parties state in the past while that if the British Government was to go down this road, it would be a game changer. The Government needs to get real and straight in relation to the fact that if the British Government goes down this road, the only real mitigation will be some form of unity. It literally will be a case of giving people on this island, and particularly those in the North, a choice of staying within the European Union or leaving to operate in what is a dysfunctional so-called United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> We support the Bill as a tidying-up exercise for many defence matters. The big issue remaining in the area is that of Defence Forces pay and its inadequacy, which must be dealt with or retention and recruitment will continue to be a problem for a force that we need.</p>

          <p eId="para_520">Others have mentioned the siege of Jadotville. I had the honour of meeting Commandant Quinlan in the audiovisual room here last year when we were shown a promotion for the film. Many of those who attended the screening are still aggrieved that we do not take into account that the people who serve in our Defence Forces take immense pride in their job and sometimes it goes down through the family generations. Having watched the film, I think the people there were let down, by the United Nations and our Government and it should never have happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> I welcome this Bill. Members have described it as being about housekeeping, tidying up and nailing down responsibilities and duties, which is very positive. Many have risked their lives on UN missions and one can go back further. Friends and relations of mine have served in the Defence Forces. I wish to raise the supports for people who have served their country but who, once their time was up and they left the system, were left behind. I refer to post traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. I know two people who only realised in the past 18 months that they were suffering from it, having left the service ten or 12 years earlier. We need to think of that when we talk about housekeeping and investing in our Defence Forces, that is, the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> Pay has been mentioned. It is very difficult to go into a bank and cash thanks. During the previous Dáil, I tabled parliamentary questions on the subject. It is alarming how many Defence Force families claim family income supplement. It must make things very difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> An Garda Síochána stopped at a car on the Ringaskiddy side of the naval base and noticed a young man sleeping in his car. The man was from Wexford and he could not go home because he was unable to put diesel in his car. That is the reality happening in some parts of our Defence Forces. It must be looked at. Throwing money at issues might not be the answer to everything but it is important that people are put on a living wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> The Minister will be very familiar with Collins Barracks and Haulbowline naval base. People there have given tremendous service and given so much to the country, but I have spoken to many of them in recent years and they feel let down and aggrieved. Sinn Féin has a Bill on the Garda Síochána and Defence Forces which would allow them to negotiate for their rights, and I think we are the only party to have this. Without union representation, they have no say.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> The Defence Forces share problems of recruitment and retention with the HSE. This is addressed in the Bill which allows former members to return. There must be acknowledgement of highly skilled people and knowledge is honourable, but it is a question of balance. People who wear the uniform of the country come to me daily, and where they should be very proud, they struggle to put food on the table. It is difficult for people to serve when they feel they are not being valued. This has to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> I raise the matter of how people are really treated in the Defence Forces and how things are reported. I was spokesperson on defence in the previous Dáil. Unfortunately, I had to submit questions to the Defence Forces on two suicides which were reported as such to me but which are recorded as negligent discharge in the Defence Forces. The Defence Forces simply reply that the coroner decides whether a case was suicide. It is about getting clarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> I began by noting that the Bill was about tidying up, proper housekeeping, responsibility and accountability. I hope that many of the issues I have raised here will be addressed in future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_528">This Bill is important but it also illustrates how ridiculous the Government was during the early weeks of the Covid-19 crisis to rush through legislation that we must now amend relating to soldiers, and officers in particular, who wish to re-enlist. We were all told that it was happy days, and officers would re-enlist. We welcomed it then and still do, but it was rushed and for no reason, because it was never the panacea for the Defence Forces' problems, which the Government presented it to the public as. It was not, it is not and it will not be. The problems in the Defence Forces are underinvestment and the undervaluing of its members. For many years, members of the Defence Forces have stayed out of duty, loyalty and the desire to see the Defence Forces act properly, and in the forlorn hope that some Government would take them sufficiently seriously to pay them properly and reflect in their pay packets at the end of the week the hours they put in away from their families. This legislation does not address that, which is a pity as it is something that the Government's first defence Bill should address.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> The Bill addresses courts martial and military law to a degree, which is welcome. However, there are many issues underlying the state of the Defence Forces, many of which I have raised over the years, back to when the Minister last held his position, on the use and abuse of Defence Force personnel who were issued with the anti-malarial drug Lariam despite warnings from many other armies and defence forces. Thankfully, its use is at an end but the legacy continues. Dealing with that legacy will be under the Minister's watch.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Ending its use is a slight admission that the policy of issuing it in the first place was wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> There is another outstanding issue which needs to be addressed and if it is addressed properly, it would show that the State properly cares for the men and women of the Defence Forces. It is the issue of those in the Air Corps who have been poisoned by chemicals. It is not something that somebody made up. Those men and women, men in particular, have suffered the consequences. There are many unexplained medical complications among those who were exposed to these chemicals. At the very least, there needs to be an investigation into the causes of these complications, into unexplained deaths, unexplained illnesses and the high rate of suicide among a small cohort. It may help some of those military families who have encouraged young people to join the Air Corps. That help is not there.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> I know many military families who have had a long tradition of military service and their sons and daughters are not thinking about careers in the Defence Forces any more. Part of it relates to wages and part of it is that they feel that they are not recognised. Another part is the absolute failure of the State. I heard a Deputy mention the establishment number of 9,500 earlier. I am old enough to remember when the State looked for 12,500 from the establishment number, and it is not that long ago. That is the sort of number that the State should be looking at but it will not achieve it. In fact, it is going towards 8,000 at the moment. That is scary because it means that many military installations cannot function and duties cannot be fulfilled, given those low numbers. The State needs to address it seriously and actively. Buying new planes during the pandemic will not address the failures in the Air Corps. Appointing new cadets by itself will not address it. The Government needs to substantially increase the numbers of recruits that are coming in and it needs people with experience who bought their way out of the Defence Forces to come back in. They are the people who will manage the Defence Forces in the interim when there are significant gaps. There are officers of different ranks trying to do the work of two or three people.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> I could go on about many other issues in the Defence Forces. Some of it is simple respect for human dignity. I was in the Curragh and saw the state of some of the toilets and living quarters. The Government might be addressing some of it, but it is not quick enough, given what I saw on that day. That is only one barracks. From what I heard from those who live in different barracks around the country, the accommodation, whether living accommodation or accommodation used for meetings and exercise, is below standard. That shows that the State has not respected them properly and does not respect them. I have no major problem with the legislation before us but it is not the legislation that should be before us. The legislation that should be before us should reflect respect for those who are in the Defence Forces.</p>

          <p eId="para_534">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Defence (Amendment) Bill. As has been said by a number of other Members, this Bill seems fairly innocuous. It may be out of date with some of the regulations that have already come into place. I have some concerns about it though the vast majority of the Bill is grand. It is interesting to note that under the Bill, a force commander would have the authority to arrest and detain a member of the Defence Forces. Would a force commander be a German, Swedish, Dutch or French officer rather than an Irish officer?</p>

          <p eId="para_538">Very good. Hopefully an Irish force commander would be somebody in charge of a force that would not be involved in active military deployment. What I am getting at here is Ireland's neutrality and our role as a neutral nation. That is really what I want to see. How does that work with active deployment? For example, if one of our forces was deployed in Afghanistan, could an Irish soldier be arrested by an American force commander? Is that what the Minister is talking about and is that part of this Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> The Minister says the Bill does not alter the current command structure in the Defence Forces but merely underpins current practice relating to day-to-day operational control of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force engaged in international operations. That is grand but what has been the <i>modus operandi</i> to date? Have enough controls and safeguards been in place, to the satisfaction of the Dáil? We have been told that they are a pillar of our security and neutrality but I do not recall, in my time here, anything being put before the Dáil relating to that. We have to take it on the Minister or Government's whim or word that our neutrality is protected with everything that we do with the Defence Forces. Is that the case and what is happening in that regard? If one reads this Bill in conjunction with other legislation such as the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993 and the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, this Bill governs the deployment of Irish troops in the past, according to what the Minister says, and will govern the deployment of Irish troops in the future which will be ongoing when the Bill comes into place.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> What is happening with the deployment of our troops? They are already deployed with UN missions which is understandable and accepted in the House. They have also been deployed as part of NATO organisations, such as in Afghanistan. There had been six or so Irish soldiers in Kabul. Are they still there? That is obviously part of a NATO organisation or deployment. What is the situation with that and how does that impact on our neutrality as it exists and in the future? One then looks at the possibility of future deployments. In the past couple of years, we have seen our troops deployed in Mali, which is basically a former French colony. France has made it difficult for Mali to develop democratically since its independence but we are quite happy to send our troops out to Mali to participate in the programme there, which will further undermine our independence and traditional stance of neutrality, which is what I am getting at. It will not come before this House because no Government will bring it before the House to discuss it. We will wake up in a couple of years and realise that we are no longer neutral, and that we are involved in all these conflicts. It may include conflicts in Africa.</p>

          <p eId="para_542">I want to bring two matters to the attention of the House. A little earlier today I received the following from the Taoiseach:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_543">In accordance with Standing Order 26 (1), I request you to summon Dáil Éireann to meet at 20.00 hours on Tuesday, 15th September, 2020 for the purpose of considering:</p>

          <p eId="para_546"> On my own behalf I will clarify, lest anyone think I had a sudden rush of blood to the head earlier. Ruling No. 221 provides that: "By virtue of the fact that Chair is sole judge of order, he may rule on matters not specifically covered by Standing Orders." Earlier today the Chair having received an extremely urgent communication from Government, and in accordance with that communication, ruled that the House should adjourn forthwith.

          <p eId="para_551">The ruling to adjourn the Dáil earlier. I rang the Taoiseach to question him on what was happening, and to say that I did not understand why the Dáil was adjourned. The Taoiseach subsequently rang me back to say he agreed and that he had asked for the Dáil to be reconvened. We have 19 junior ministers. I am not sure what the legal basis was for this. Under the Constitution the House sets its own rules, as we all know, but a precedent has been set here. We are living in different times. This could happen again and there could be issues like this again. The Dáil adjourned in such a rush that we did not get a full explanation, dare I say it, from the Ceann Comhairle of whichever Standing Order under which it was done and the manner in which it was done. What was the chain of communication by which the Ceann Comhairle came to this decision, who told him and what was the chain of that conversation all the way back? That all needs to be outlined to Members in this special situation. I am not sure, but I doubt that if I had not made that phone call to the Taoiseach we would be back here now. He queried it and I acknowledge he was not fully aware of the facts at the time because he had just come back, but in fairness he subsequently questioned it. I would like to know who the Taoiseach spoke to. As a result of that we are now back in the House. On what basis was the decision made? What were the Standing Orders? What were the communications by which the Ceann Comhairle was communicated with to make that decision? Why did the Ceann Comhairle not just come into the Dáil and instead of saying what he said, which took everybody by surprise, just explained it in the detail that was necessary? This is unprecedented. I am not sure it has ever happened in this way before. I would like a lot more information on how the decision came about. Was there a role whereby the acting Chief Medical Officer advised the Chief Whip who advised the Clerk of the Dáil? What was the process? This could have other ramifications.</p>

          <p eId="para_552">This is an incredible shambles. Members had been informed on social media that the Dáil was adjourned until next Tuesday. I work with a team of 37 Deputies, and there are 160 Deputies in total. There was a clear schedule of business, including questions, statements, and a Private Member's motion. It was hours of business. We were trying to relay the information we were given in a complete vacuum. I am the whip for a party with 37 Deputies and nobody from this institution contacted me this evening. Nobody told me what was going on or what was happening. I had to rely on political correspondents on Twitter. How embarrassing is it for our democracy that political correspondents on Twitter knew more and that I had no information for the 37 Deputies I work with? I had to go on Twitter to see what was happening and what was developing. What has happened this evening is absolutely outrageous. I totally support the proposal by Deputy Alan Kelly. Our party demands a full explanation as to how the Dáil was adjourned and how our business has been so badly disrupted.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> We now have proposals for business tomorrow but we do not know if we will be in the convention centre or in the Dáil. We have a meeting at 9 o'clock. I finally had to ring the Government Chief Whip and, in fairness, he gave me a draft schedule that had been put together. There was no communication whatsoever from this institution. It is absolutely shocking and I need an explanation.</p>

          <p eId="para_554">I reiterate the comments of my two colleagues on the Business Committee, Deputies Kelly and Mac Lochlainn. We had no communication either. I made contact with the Clerk to try to find out what was going on because I was reading on Twitter about what was happening in the House. It is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> I accept that we have three Airí Stáit in the Chamber from the Department of Health. I appreciate and understand that. I cannot understand, however, why we could not have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who I presume socially distanced at Cabinet and who was not there for more than two hours because he did not go to the press conference afterwards. If the Aire comes to the House this evening, it will be the fourth Minister in three months from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine accountable to this House. Surely a mechanism could be found where the Minister could be in one of the committee rooms to answer parliamentary questions in the House, rather than us having to wait for another set of questions, which will be after the budget, to hear anything from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine himself.</p>

I had intended to raise a very important issue on damage done to roads in west Cork due to flooding in August, and I am seeking funding for same. By the looks of it, I will not get that chance tonight. I seek clarification on whether Topical Issue matters will be taken tonight. If they are not taken tonight will the Topical Issue matters chosen for discussion tonight be taken tomorrow instead? It is very important for my constituents that I raise this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_559">It is outrageous for anybody to even suggest that anything the Ceann Comhairle did was anything other than acting in the best interests of this House. Given the basis of the information the Ceann Comhairle was given at the time he was given it, he was acting in what I would call the utmost of good faith.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> Rather than going along the lines of Deputy Alan Kelly's proposal and having a post mortem on the last couple of hours around what happened, who said what to whom, and when they said it, perhaps it would be more progressive to discuss what way we shall go forward for the next few days and for the next week. I believe the people of Ireland would like to see us discussing what way we will go forward, rather than analysing that last hours and if there was a hiccup, a mix-up or a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> The one thing nobody has said yet is that we hope everyone who is self-isolating and who has this difficulty will be well.

          <p eId="para_568">The Ceann Comhairle just informed the Dáil that we will do what the Taoiseach directed us to do. That might have been a slip of the tongue, and if it was I invite the Ceann Comhairle to clarify that. We have a Constitution and we have three branches of Government. One has barely functioned for the past three months, one is in self-isolation, and we are sitting. The role of the Taoiseach is not to tell the Dáil what to do. It is the role of the Dáil to hold the Taoiseach to account. I am quite concerned. I am not looking for a post mortem but I agree with colleagues in the Chamber that we must recognise this is a shambles and ensure it does not happen again.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">I will deal with the last question first. Standing Order 26(1) is quite clear that when the House has been adjourned, as it was and is then recalled on foot of a summons of the Taoiseach , the only work that can be transacted is the work set out by the Taoiseach in the summons so that is why we are where we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> I have absolutely no difficulty with the questions from Deputies Alan Kelly and Mac Lochlainn and others; they are absolutely legitimate and in order. Just for the sake of clarity, I arrived here to take health questions. It was indicated to me before I arrived that there might be a problem with the Minister for Health's availability. While we were waiting, I was approached by a very senior member of the team who had received a message from Government to the effect that there were - I am not sure what terminology we should use, whether it is self-isolation or whatever - problems with the availability of Ministers to transact business here. The advice that we were receiving from Government was that the House should adjourn and that it would be recalled in due course by the Taoiseach. Now that is quite simple and straightforward and the Taoiseach has now clarified the matter and recalled the House. I have no difficulty with how I acted. I do not think anybody else would have acted any differently. How we came to be asked to take that action at that particular time is another story but we need to get on with the business now. I hope my explanation is crystal clear to everyone. Is it?</p>

The House has been adjourned before in quite different circumstances.

          <p eId="para_583">The issues that were raised by Deputies are reasonable. Deputy Kelly raised the question of how the decision was communicated to the Ceann Comhairle but the bigger concern for me was the fact that the first I learned of the Dáil being recalled this evening was on the six o'clock news when the Taoiseach spoke about it. Political correspondents seem to have more information than we did. My colleague raised a legitimate point because there was no communication with him as a whip. That is the point and that is not good enough. Whatever about when decisions have to be made and I accept that the Ceann Comhairle made his decision in good faith. I was here in the Chamber when he got that news and I fully accept that but what happened in the following few hours, when there was very poor, if any, communication with parties and Deputies and we had to learn from the Taoiseach on the news that we might be sitting at 8 o'clock is not good practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_584">Again, to clarify, when communications from Government were received by my office indicating that it wished, contrary to what we understood earlier, to reconvene the House this evening, we indicated that a summons would be required from the Taoiseach. That summons was duly produced. I directed and the Clerk instigated a request for a meeting of the Business Committee to be convened to look at the business that might be transacted tomorrow because issues arise from the fact that the Dáil was scheduled to meet in the convention centre. The Special Committee on Covid-19 Response is also due to meet tomorrow, as is the Seanad, so there are significant matters, including matters of business, to be considered and they will be dealt with at 9 o'clock at the Business Committee meeting that we have convened to enable everybody to have an input.</p>

          <p eId="para_586">What I am interpreting, based on the Ceann Comhairle's guidance, is that the Government's advice to him left him with no option but to make the call that he made. That is the interpretation I take from that. Then no whip on the opposition side, and there are seven in total, or leader was communicated with directly, apart from Deputy Alan Kelly's conversation with the Taoiseach. There was no direct communication with us from the Government side to outline to us ideas about how we would deal with the schedule, whether we were convening tonight and so on. We had to rely on political correspondents who were clearly being briefed by Government sources while no whip in this House was being briefed. This is a very serious matter. The Government's advice left the Ceann Comhairle with no choice but to adjourn the business and I accept that, but in the interim, the Government was briefing political journalists about its plans. Not one whip got a phone call to be consulted about the reconfiguring of the schedule or to be advised of the Government's plans. That is what has happened here tonight.</p>

Three minutes after leaving the Chamber here I heard it reported on a radio station that a Government spokesperson was unaware of what had just happened in the Dáil. The Deputy can imagine my surprise at that. Anyway, we are now where we are. Can we please get on with the health questions? It is great to see such interest in the questions on health.

            <p eId="para_589">My question relates to the very serious challenge that acute hospitals in our health service will face over the next number of months. We have been hearing for some time from the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, that he will produce a winter plan. By the way, I want to wish him well and I very much hope that a negative result comes back. He has said that he will produce a winter plan. This is not just about a winter plan but also about Covid, non-Covid and catch-up care and a plan that enables us to do all of that. My question asks how that is going to happen, what supports and measures are being put in place and what funding will be made available.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Mary Butler)<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_590">I thank Deputy Cullinane for his question. As we all know, the Minister for Health has been feeling unwell, has been referred for a Covid-19 test and is self-isolating. We all wish him well.</p>
            <p eId="para_591"> I will endeavour to answer the questions posed as fully as possible. If any of my answers are insufficient, written answers can also be provided. In reply to the Deputy's very important question, resuming health and social care services and building health sector capacity and capability is a priority for the Government. The coming winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid and non-Covid health care demands. <b>
							</b>Every winter is challenging but there is no doubt that with Covid-19 this winter is going to be particularly difficult. The HSE is finalising a plan, in line with Sláintecare principles, for delivering services in a Covid pandemic for the period to December 2021 and incorporating winter 2020-21. The initiatives in the plan to mitigate the winter pressures are under three headings, namely, community care, acute care and assistance to support hospital egress. Timely discharge from acute hospital settings is hugely important. Throughflow in hospitals is vitally important so that there will be capacity at the emergency department end. This will include increasing hospital and community capacity, reducing unnecessary hospital admissions by enhancing alternative community care pathways, and enabling timely discharges from acute hospitals, and consequently reduce waiting times in hospital emergency departments. There will be a focus on targeted actions to shift care to home and ambulatory care environments, especially for high-risk cohorts such as elderly patients and those with chronic illnesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_592"> As the Deputy knows, the pandemic has borne down hardest on our older generation. I have for many years been an advocate for the correct wrap-around supports for our elderly generation living at home, which is what this plan hopes to achieve. Obviously, older people are not in a position to go to day care centres or to be out and about, so they need the supports, rehab and re-ablement at home. Disability and mental health services, e-health and staffing will also be included in the plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_593"> The resources for the plan will be sought as part of the 2021 Estimates process. In advance of this, the Government has allocated €600 million to support the early roll-out of the winter-specific measures in this plan, with €200 million up to Christmas and €400 million thereafter. This will facilitate the commencement of priority measures from an operational perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_594"> A key action will be a comprehensive flu vaccination programme. The HSE has placed orders for approximately 1.35 million doses of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine, as well as 600,000 doses of the live attenuated influenza vaccine, which will be made available to children aged from two to 12 years old, inclusive.</p>
            <p eId="para_595"> In regard to acute bed capacity, the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to continuing investment in our health care services in line with the recommendations of the health service capacity review and the commitments in Project Ireland 2040. The Minister's Department is working with the HSE to increase both general and critical care acute capacity in hospitals nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_596"> It is very important, as we face into the winter, that we are very conscious of the most vulnerable in our society. We are talking about people with mental health issues, the elderly and people with disabilities, especially those with acute disabilities. I would also like to mention carers, given I hosted a round-table for carers this afternoon. Carers have been to the fore in the past six months, during which they had to cocoon at home with their loved one.</p>

            <p eId="para_597">I am very conscious of the most vulnerable people and I am very conscious they are people we have to protect over the next weeks and months. It is not good enough that the HSE is only finalising a plan. We have an unprecedented crisis facing us. Although we thought we saw chaos over recent weeks and months, unless this Government gets its act together, unless a real, aggressive, robust plan is put in place to deal with the challenges facing our healthcare services in the next while, and unless that plan is as robust as it needs to be, then the Minister of State and the Government are failing in their duty.</p>
            <p eId="para_598"> We have a perfect storm coming at our health services. Our front-line healthcare workers need support. People need to know they will get treatment and that the capacity will be there. I did not hear one word in the Minister of State's answer about how many additional beds or staff will be made available, what capacity will be leveraged in the private sector or how we are going to make sure we can deal with both Covid and non-Covid care. All I got is a statement of the obvious and no plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_599">The Deputy is correct we are living in unprecedented times. I do not think it is a statement of the obvious to announce €600 million to support people in the winter plan that runs throughout the winter until after Christmas.</p>
            <p eId="para_600"> The Deputy is right when he says bed capacity is the most important thing going forward. The whole purpose of this plan is to try to keep as many people in their homes and in the community. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country in the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic response. Funding was provided in March for an additional 324 acute beds, which brought the reported acute inpatient capacity to 11,597 beds, excluding critical care beds. This was an average of 11,000 inpatient beds open during 2020 up to the end of July. There were 304 general acute beds and 41 adult critical care beds available in the system on Thursday, 10 September.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_601">The Minister of State gives me a figure of €600 million and no detail of what that will mean. I published a plan in the first week of August and we set out what is necessary. The last figures we got from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, showed 610,000 people - record numbers - waiting to see a consultant. They showed that inpatient and outpatient waiting times were up and that, across all of the specialties, people are waiting longer. However, there is no sense of urgency from this Government and no idea what is facing front-line healthcare workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_602"> As to the planning that goes into putting the extra staff and the extra beds in our hospitals, we know it takes time. However, coming with a plan in the middle of September when we know the crisis is here and now is not good enough, in particular when we have been asking the Minister for months to come forward with a plan. It is not good enough to throw out a figure and say that we will spend a certain amount of money at some point and that we will come in at some point.</p>
            <p eId="para_603"> We had a plan announced by the Government today on living with the virus but there is no Government time to debate it. I hope that when it announces its winter plan, there will be proper statements in the Dáil so the Minister can be held to account.</p>

            <p eId="para_604">I take the Deputy’s point, which is well made, but he has to remember we are living in unprecedented times. We are learning as we go along. When the Covid pandemic hit in March and April, all of our capacity was put into the acute hospital sector because that is what we had learned from seeing what was happening in Europe. Unfortunately, the pandemic bore down hardest on our older generation. We lost 985 people in our nursing home system, and 54% of all those who have died to date were lost in the nursing home sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_605"> A huge amount of work is being done. Testing, tracing and isolating are the bywords of what we have to face going forward. Even though the Deputy says there is no detail, the detail will follow. I know, for example, that we are looking to double the amount of home care supports for our older generation, and we are looking at rehab in the home and at re-enablement in the home to protect our older generation and to keep them out of the acute hospital setting. While there are many challenges ahead, I believe we have a fantastic front-line service which is well up for the challenge.</p>

            <p eId="para_607">Will the Government give a commitment to prioritise increased funding for mental health services in Tipperary and nationwide in budget 2021? I ask that question in the context that, last week, the HSE head of operations said there has been a significant increase in referrals to mental health services as a result of Covid-19. As we know, mental health services were already overstretched before the pandemic, meaning services now need substantial investment if people are to get the mental health supports they need when they need them.</p>

            <p eId="para_608">I thank the Deputy for his question. I will be engaging in detail with the Estimates process and seeking additional funding for all mental health services. The challenges of Covid and living with the virus have caused huge problems for those with mental health issues and challenges. In line with the programme for Government, promoting positive mental health and reducing the burden of illness can have benefits for everyone. Mental health service users are among the most vulnerable people in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_609"> I know the Deputy has been a long-time advocate for mental health service users in Tipperary. As he knows, I have visited Tipperary on three occasions since I became Minister of State with responsibility for older people. I first met with Oireachtas Members. On a second occasion, I met again with Oireachtas Members and with different support groups in Tipperary which are trying to support people with mental health issues. On a third occasion, I visited South Tipperary General Hospital and stayed there for three hours. Further to that, I also visited St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny, including the department of psychiatry, to see the exact situation in regard to inpatient beds. People with mental health issues from south Tipperary who need inpatient supports go to St. Luke's in Kilkenny and those from north Tipperary, the Deputy’s own area, go to Ennis Hospital for those supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_610"> I am acutely aware of the challenges in the area and that the Deputy is very concerned there are no inpatient beds in Tipperary itself. However, I believe the bed capacity is there at Ennis and at St. Luke's. For example, last year, the capacity in the department of psychiatry in St. Luke's was at 85% for the whole year.</p>

            <p eId="para_611">I appreciate and acknowledge the Minister of State's commitment to improving mental health services in Tipperary and all of us recognise that. The problem is whether she has a budget to deliver. I have no doubt the Minister of State is well meaning, but I remind her that Tipperary is a large county with a population of 160,000 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">The distance from Lorrha at the northern end of the county to Carrick-on-Suir is 130 km. The mental health strategy and the policy enforced on Tipperary by the then Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, deprived our patients of access to vital services. The people of the county who have mental health issues are at a disadvantage. The county is left without a single acute mental health bed. There are no proper respite mental health beds. Access to crucial services is split between Ennis and Kilkenny. The system has not worked for Tipperary. It is a failed policy. The neglect of our mental health patients is indefensible. The extent of the deficit in services is bordering on irresponsible. The Minister of State needs a budget to correct it.</p>

            <p eId="para_613">I will refer to the budget first. Budget 2020 saw the Government continue its commitment to mental health by increasing funding by €39 million to €1.026 billion. This represents an increase of over €315 million or 45% since 2012. Admittedly, we have a long way to go, and I am very conscious of that. I have three priorities for Tipperary. My first priority and commitment is to have Jigsaw open in Thurles before Christmas. I have given that commitment and I will follow through on it. The second commitment I gave previously, and this is where the budget Estimates are involved, is to seek €2 million in those Estimates to redo the crisis house in Tipperary which I believe is not fit for purpose. Third, under Sharing the Vision I will task the national implementation monitoring committee with completing a review of mental health bed capacity throughout the country. There are major issues in the south east, not only in Tipperary. Waterford and Wexford have the same issues relating to capacity. The first thing I want the committee to look at is bed capacity, and then we will work from there.</p>

            <p eId="para_614">The reality is that the mental health budget has remained at 6% of the overall health budget for many years. There are fewer staff working in mental health services than there were in 2008. In January 2020, there were 10,642 individuals waiting for 12 months or more on waiting lists. There were also 2,000 children and young people on the waiting lists. In regard to Tipperary, at a time when there are dramatically increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, isolation and loneliness, the lack of access to mental health services is inexcusable. At a time of great vulnerability, mental health patients in Tipperary are reaching out to an empty space. The lack of access to professional care, guidance and support is unacceptable. It must be seen as a priority for the Minister of State and this Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_615">When I visited the emergency department, ED, in South Tipperary General Hospital, I was delighted to meet the team operating there. All mental health patients attending the ED are triaged in accordance with assessed clinical need with the objective of referring them as soon as possible to the HSE mental health service when they are discharged from the ED. The ED has a 24-hour mental health nurse liaison service for mental health patients, seven days a week. This was put in place in 2012 when St. Michael's closed down. Many other areas in Ireland would love to have similar supports. I spoke at length to the mental health liaison nurse on duty, who is one of three who deliver this 24-hour service. We discussed many issues that were raised with me previously, including voluntary and involuntary admissions, transfer of service users, assessment and the department of psychiatry. There are two rooms dedicated for that purpose. One is for the nurses and the other is for the patient as soon as he or she enters the ED and has been triaged. I will give the commitment I gave previously, which is that I will continue to work with all Deputies in Tipperary to try to improve the mental health services there.</p>

We have been asking the Government for some time to ramp up testing and tracing. In fact, the calls we made were rubbished and dismissed by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in the past. We now see that we were right and we are paying the price for the fact that we do not have enough capacity. What action is the Government taking to ratchet up capacity in testing and tracing?</p>

            <p eId="para_618">This is a very important question because the entire premise of Covid is test, trace and isolate. A comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing operation is central to our public health strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_619"> Capacity has been in place since early summer to test 15,000 people a day. While the system came under pressure in recent weeks, overall the system is working well and is proving central to our public health response. Rigorous contact tracing, automatic testing of close contacts, serial testing in high-risk environments and large-scale testing in outbreak situations mean we are proactively finding more cases than we would have found previously. Today, we learned that there are 357 cases and, unfortunately, three people have lost their lives. I offer my sympathies and condolences to their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_620"> In recent weeks we have needed to flex resources up significantly as demand has increased. We are testing more people than ever before, with over 71,000 tests completed in the week ending 12 September. Community testing has increased in line with a steady increase in the prevalence of the disease and the HSE has deployed additional resources to meet this increased demand.  This included the opening of additional community testing centres and mobile pop-up testing units, significantly increased contact tracing teams and increased laboratory testing.</p>
            <p eId="para_621"> Our testing strategy and infrastructure compare well internationally. We are in the top third of EU countries in terms of tests completed as a percentage of the overall population and capacity levels and turnaround times are similar to those of many countries. We are also going further than many other countries in pursuing a robust testing strategy, which includes testing of close contacts and serial testing in nursing homes and food processing facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_622"> That is not to say we cannot improve further. We can always improve. I acknowledge that the system has come under strain in recent weeks. The HSE is now finalising a future service model for testing and tracing. The plan includes the recruitment of a permanent workforce, which has already commenced, and a range of other service improvements which will be rolled out quickly. Transition to the new model is under way and will continue throughout the autumn.</p>

That is not to say testing has not been happening because it has, but it has not been happening at the rates at which it should be happening and it is not quick enough, despite all the promises that were made. We have been calling for this for some time, but those calls have fallen on deaf ears. We saw what happened in meat plants and we see what is happening in Dublin. Testing and tracing must be used to hunt down this virus. The Government said it could reach 100,000 tests per week by the middle of May. It has not done so. Now the Minister of State talks about hiring more staff. Why were the staff not hired last month, two months ago or three months ago when we were raising these concerns in the Dáil? My party leader raised them directly with the Minister of State's party leader. She also raised them with the Tánaiste when he was Taoiseach, with the Minister for Health and with the previous Minister for Health. It is only now that the Government is getting around to providing the extra capacity. It is not good enough and it undermines confidence in the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_624">As I said, 71,000 people were tested last week. We have had to ramp up testing considerably in the last four to six weeks because Covid has changed and is changing. It is more prevalent in communities now. In March, April and into May we were testing many people, but we managed to flatten the curve. The lockdown worked. People stayed at home and did not move further than 2 km from their location. However, as soon as we started to reopen society, Covid returned. Covid is not going anywhere. It is lying dormant and is in our communities. Some 30 community testing sites are open and three pop-up testing sites have been mobilised in Limerick, Tallaght and Carlow-Kilkenny. The Deputy is right that we cannot rest on our laurels. Testing, tracing and isolation are the way forward. It is the only way to flatten this virus. I have no doubt that the Minister will make every effort to ensure we will ramp up capacity wherever it is needed. However, 71,000 people were tested last week.</p>

            <p eId="para_627">Of course, when people were in lockdown the numbers were going to go down. My point is that it was pointed out that when the economy started to reopen we would see more community transmission and the virus would look for places to spread. That is what happened. The way to prevent that, because prevention is what we need, is to ratchet up testing and tracing. The Government failed to do it in nursing homes originally, and it failed to do it in meat plants.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">The Minister of State may have heard of a cluster in a meat plant in our constituency. She might have seen stories in a local newspaper of a bus packed to the rafters with people going to work. This is what is happening. Testing was not being carried out in these areas. I am holding the Government not to my standard but to the standard it set for itself. It has never done 100,000 tests a week. It is only now telling us that it is recruiting staff on the same day it launched a plan on how to live with the virus. That is simply not good enough.</p>

            <p eId="para_629">Testing of staff in nursing homes has been ongoing for the past two months and has proven very effective. As regards the meat factory the Deputy mentioned, I have two family members who have worked there for a very long time and they were tested last Thursday. There was a hullabaloo that there was no testing in meat factories last week, but in Dawn Meats in Grannagh over 800 people were tested last Thursday. We have to deal with the facts. The HSE is adding swabbing capacity in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare, Louth and Galway. Pop-up testing centres remain in place in Limerick and Carlow and there is additional staffing and longer opening hours in many sites. We must remember that at the start of the pandemic, many front-line workers were redeployed to the test, trace and isolate service because the ordinary person did not understand it. People needed to have a medical background. We know so much more now and permanent people will be put in place. As the virus was suppressed and the curve was flattened, these medical people had to go back into the acute system to deliver non-Covid services.</p>

            <p eId="para_633">In last year's budget, the Government announced that it would extend the medical card to seven and eight year olds and extend medical card eligibility for the over-70s by changing the eligibility criteria and the thresholds for entry. It also promised that all people with a terminal illness would have a medical card, and examining that issue was in the programme for Government. We passed a Bill on this matter in this House a number of weeks ago. There has still been no progress on these issues and my constituency office is inundated with people asking when this is going to happen. The Minister of State now has the floor and has the opportunity to provide clarity.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">I thank the Deputy for keeping me on my toes today.</p>
            <p eId="para_635"> First, I acknowledge the difficult year older people in our society have experienced as a result of Covid-19. They have shown tremendous resilience in helping to fight the spread of Covid-19. The issue the Deputy raises is one that is very close to me as Minister of State with responsibility for older people and mental health.</p>
            <p eId="para_636"> Budget 2020 provided for an increase in the medical card thresholds for persons aged 70 and over. The threshold is currently €900 for a couple but would increase to €1,050.  While it was intended that this measure would be implemented from July, it was not possible to legislate for the necessary amendments to provide for this measure until there was a fully constituted Dáil and Seanad. The Deputy is quite correct. The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was very pleased that his first piece of legislation was the Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020, which provides for the increases in the income thresholds.</p>
            <p eId="para_637"> When that measure was proposed in the budget last year, it was set to be introduced if sufficient savings were made in the health budget this year. As we are all aware, that is not possible at the moment. Those savings have not been realised as the pandemic has placed a significant demand on public finances, a substantial proportion of which have been allocated to the health system. In that context, decisions on the associated funding and a potential implementation date are being actively considered. I have sat down with the Minister on this matter because it is something we need to move on. I want to see it happening and it will be discussed in the context of the budget. I am hopeful that we will be able to bring this in. It would mean that for those over 70 who have an income of €900 and have missed out on a medical card, the threshold would increase to €1,050. I will be pushing this issue hard.</p>

            <p eId="para_638">I do not think those over 70 will take any comfort from the fact that this might be addressed again in this year's budget. I do not doubt the Minister of State's sincerity or her association with this issue. The problem is that last year, in my constituency and around the State, Government Deputies were going around saying that this was one of the great things they had in the budget. They said that more people over 70 would get medical cards, as would seven and eight year olds, but that has not happened. We are now hearing that it might happen and it might be in this year's budget again. The fact is that the money should be provided to make it happen. Parents have contacted me whose children have passed the age of six and are now seven or eight. They say that they were promised this and were told it was in last year's budget. They are asking what is happening. The negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation on this matter have not even occurred. The Minister has not even started discussions with the medical organisation to see what can happen. We need more answers and more clarity than "may" or "might", given that this was in last year's budget and was voted on by this House.</p>

            <p eId="para_641">As the Deputy will be aware, I am here representing the Minister for Health. I am glad the Deputy accepts my bona fides on this matter because I have spoken to the Minister about it and we are very anxious to make progress on the medical cards. Currently, 75% of persons aged over 70 have a medical card and if the potential beneficiaries, which could be up to 56,000 people, materialise then an increase in the income thresholds would result in over 88% of this cohort being eligible for a medical card. It is an important health measure which will provide medical card eligibility to a greater proportion of people over 70. All I can say here today is that I will continue to push this issue with the Minister. We are in an unprecedented times. Over €600 million has been allocated today for supports which will be seen in the next week or two. The Deputy has a guarantee from me that I will continue to push this.</p>

            <p eId="para_642">I will make the point again that this was voted on in last year's budget. I do not think there is a Deputy in this Chamber, whether Government or Opposition, who has not been lobbied or received correspondence from parents of children and from older people about this.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> I also raised the issue of cancer patients and other patients with terminal illnesses who were promised that medical cards for them would also be examined. When Fianna Fáil was involved in the confidence and supply agreement and was taking credit for all the good things it saw in the budget, but not the bad, the extension of eligibility for the medical card was one of the good things. Deputy after Deputy on the Government side took credit for it. Deputies from Fianna Fáil were falling over themselves to claim credit for the fact that children were going to get medical cards when they were seven or eight years old and more older people would get medical cards, but it has not been delivered. It is a broken promise. We are now being told it might be included in this year's budget. If that is the best I can bring back to the people in my constituency who have contacted me, I do not believe, on their behalf, that it is good enough. </p>

            <p eId="para_644">I can certainly say that I was not one of the people who said this was a done deal because it was always contingent on there being a surplus in the budget in 2020 to deliver it. That was the small print that was written into it but who bothers with small print?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Butler<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_650">I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 47 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> Like many other sectors of the economy, the construction sector was impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. This resulted in construction-related work on the site of the new children's hospital stopping on 31 March due to Covid-19 restrictions. On 18 May, the restrictions in respect of the construction sector were eased. From this date, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, engaged with the main contractor to ensure the earliest possible reopening of the sites. I am informed the main contractor of the new children's hospital project returned to the site on 13 July.</p>
            <p eId="para_652"> There will be delays associated with Covid-19, but it is too early to assess fully the impact of the pandemic on the new children's hospital project and the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Tallaght Hospital. The NPHDB continues to engage with the contractor and is monitoring progress on site in the interests of completing the project as quickly and economically as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_653"> On that note, I want to say I am acutely aware of how urgently the new children's hospital is needed and I want to see it delivered as quickly as possible on behalf of children, young people and their families. I have no doubt the Deputies share that view; we have waited far too long for this hospital. Under the contract, the new children's hospital is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and handed over to Children's Health Ireland to be opened in 2023 after a period of commissioning. I am advised that as of March 2020, when the site closed due to Covid-19, the NPHDB was of the view that the main contractor was behind schedule on the construction works.</p>
            <p eId="para_654"> The NPHDB is continuing to engage with the main contractor to obtain an updated programme of works that is in line with its contractual commitments. Any delivery outside of the timelines agreed under the contract could be a matter for dispute resolution, so I wish to be careful in respect of what I say here, but I reiterate that it is a priority of the Minister and the Government that the hospital be completed as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> The €1.73 billion figure mentioned by Deputy Daly is the total overall project cost advised to the previous Government in December 2018. That figure comprises €1.43 billion, which is the overall cost to complete the capital project, and also a broader programme of activity associated with the integration and transfer of the services of the three children's hospitals to the new site under development. This includes, for example, investment in ICT, an electronic health record system and the children's hospital integration programme, which is the merging of the three paediatric hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> The PwC report makes clear that the guaranteed maximum price established through the two-stage tender process does not provide a contractual ceiling on cost, and that significant residual risks of further cost remain. The residual risks, for which there cannot be cost certainty, include items such as construction inflation, claims and certain uncontrollable risks, such as potential costs relating to Brexit. I am advised the main contractor has submitted a significant number of claims that it alleges are outside of the agreed scope. The NPHDB has a robust process in place for the assessment of claims by the contractor in accordance with the construction contract. This process is a commercially sensitive one between the contractor and the board. </p>
            <p eId="para_657"> An instruction to commence with phase B, above ground works, was issued to the main contractor in January 2019. In February 2019, the main contractor informed the NPHDB that it was disputing the validity of that instruction. As the matter is now before the courts, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage, even as regards the legal fees. I will, however, outline the legal fees in my follow-up response.</p>

            <p eId="para_658">I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive history of what has gone on but, unfortunately, neither of the two main questions was answered in the long response she gave. The budget is approaching and a proper one is needed, including for University Hospital Kerry. The hospital is at serious risk of being downgraded because it is underfunded, and the cost of the children's hospital will be a very significant factor in that. It is unfortunate that although this question was submitted three or possibly four months ago, and given the record number, the answer has come back only today. Still there is no answer to my two main questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_659"> To divert the issue slightly, there is a serious risk that Kerry General Hospital will be downgraded. There is no cardiology and little oncology. Rheumatology is gone. Pathology, nursing and radiography have all been outsourced. Ambulances often have to come from Dingle to Tralee if there has been an incident and somebody needs one. Research in infrastructure is gone and there is a fear among staff and the people of Kerry that the hospital will be downgraded. It needs to be fixed.</p>

            <p eId="para_660">I thank all three Ministers of State for standing in beyond their briefs and wish the Minister the best.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> There is no doubt that the children's hospital will not be built on time and that it will cost much more than expected. I was across this issue quite a bit in the previous Dáil, as many will be aware. What we need now is a projection of timelines and costs. Covid-19 will bring additional costs to everything, including all construction projects. We need to know the Government's position on this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> It found €600 million to be announced on Thursday. From a capital point of view, many other projects are required throughout the country, including extensions because we need more space across a whole load of disciplines. Are we going to profile out further the children's hospital because we need the money? Let us answer that question. Many of the legal challenges taking place in court are for fairly small sums. Let us be honest and straight up with the people. There is no massive criticism of this Government on the issue; it is a legacy of the previous one. What are the timelines and the projected costs as of now?</p>

            <p eId="para_663">The question that Deputy Daly initially asked related to the timeframe for the construction of the new children's hospital. I answered that by saying it would be completed at the end of 2022 and opened in 2023. Those are the dates I have been given.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> The Deputy also asked about the legal fees. In respect of legal costs, the NPHDB has statutory responsibility for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital. I have been informed that its legal fees were €409,000 in 2017, €128,000 in 2018 and €691,000 in 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> To respond to Deputy Kelly, he made a very fair point about projections of the timeline and the costs. As we all know, Covid is delaying matters. The Deputy asked about reprofiling the project into the future, but I will have to defer to the Minister on that and seek a written reply for the Deputy, if that is acceptable.</p>

            <p eId="para_666">On the legal costs, the Minister of State referred to the costs of the board. Are they the total legal costs, including those of anyone who is claiming against it? It is possible to fix the problems at Kerry General Hospital. In February, there were three ICU beds at University Hospital Kerry, whereas one month later, there were 17, thanks to the great efforts of the ICU staff and the additional resources that were put in place due to Covid. We were able to get some answers more or less straight away, but now I fear we are back to circumstances in which a PR firm has been engaged on behalf of the hospital. The reply to this question came faster than it would have come from the PR firm. I thank the Minister of State, therefore, for the efforts she made in her contributions.</p>

            <p eId="para_667">There are so many competing issues going on. For instance, we all know we need budgets throughout the country for hospital prevention measures. The HSE has been excellent in my county, producing an elderly care unit in Thurles, which is fantastic and fair play to them, to analyse those who are elderly and to prevent them ending up in hospital in the first place. I encourage more of that throughout Ireland. For mental services, in fairness, the Minister of State is battling for a capital budget to renovate the unit in Clonmel or to secure another location. That is the type of information we need to know straight up. If the children's hospital needs to be reprofiled, given the massive budget there will be, let us just say it. Sometimes the Government just has to make decisions and sometimes we in opposition have to be honest and accept that. Let us just say out straight that budgets will need to be diverted, if needs be.</p>

There is a similar programme in Waterford, Waterford Integrated Care for Older People. It is about keeping older people in their communities with geriatrician care. Reablement in the community is important. Going forward, we need to strive to keep our older people safely and securely in the comfort of their own homes with the correct wraparound supports. </p>

            <p eId="para_673">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. A robust testing referral pathway for GPs was put in place in the early days of the pandemic and it has proved a vital component of our overall testing pathway. Enhancements to the referral process have been made throughout the pandemic, including the extension to out-of-hours GP services and new IT systems were developed or modified. The GP community has been a key partner in our efforts to quickly identify and test suspect cases of Covid-19 and I would like to acknowledge the vital role it continues to play in the management of this disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_674"> The HSE is finalising a future service model for testing and tracing. This service model will aim to deliver a patient-centred, accessible, consistent and flexible service, and will take into account the evolving needs and future potential service demands in the context of Covid-19 surges in disease transmission. The process to develop this future service model is examining all aspects of the testing pathway. </p>
            <p eId="para_675"> As part of this process, the HSE is examining approaches adopted internationally and is considering a variety of options that can best deliver on the above aims of increasing accessibility, consistency and flexibility. As part of this work, I understand that the HSE is considering the merits of complementary referral pathways to those already in place in general practice and out-of-hours services to provide additional capacity within referral services. It is important to stress that these pathways would be additional to what is already in place and would not replace in any way the important service currently provided by general practice. </p>
            <p eId="para_676"> I understand that significant work has already been undertaken on the design of the future service model and engagement with key stakeholders is ongoing. It will be important that any complementary pathways are fully considered, including in relation to appropriate clinical governance arrangements. The Minister hopes to receive a final proposal from the HSE over the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_677">I thank the Minister of State for the information. I really appreciate it. The issue is that general practitioners are inundated and we all know it. Increasingly, they are being swamped. For one particular general practitioner in Cork, the number of people presenting has been impossible to deal with. What does the Government propose to do to free up or create a more streamlined process in order that general practitioners during a bad winter or whatever lies ahead - it is going to be bad one way or the other but hopefully not too bad - can do their normal work and not be totally taken up with Covid? We have to look to alternatives. The report mentioned will be welcome. General practitioners also will be administering the influenza vaccination. They will be inundated in terms of that service, although I welcome that.</p>
            <p eId="para_678"> We have to look to alternatives. The device I am holding up is a Covid test. It takes ten minutes but it is not 100% accurate. I am no expert but I am told it is between 90% and 95% accurate. The test took ten minutes. How is it proposed to do population testing? Is it proposed to roll out all other forms of technologies as well, obviously regulated and so on? </p>

            <p eId="para_679">I agree with what Deputy Alan Kelly said. If the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, was here I am sure he too would agree with him. We have to consider the advantages and disadvantages of a self-referral or alternative referral system. A self-referral system has the potential to broaden access to testing, thereby providing greater out-of-hours access and would likely reduce turnaround times. It could also provide additional capacity as general practitioner surgeries move into the winter. It is important to remember that the referral system became overwhelmed in the early days of the pandemic and it is currently experiencing significant pressures.</p>
            <p eId="para_680"> I have researched the device the Deputy held up. I note it has been introduced in the UK. I understand it is 99.8% accurate, if one were to believe the data. It is the model we need to be moving to. It is worthy of consideration. The costing is as outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. When the Minister returns, the Deputy and he should have a conversation around the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_681">Interestingly, I offered to speak to the Minister about it but I have not heard back from him since. It is an open invitation. I have no problem referring people who provide it. There are a number of variations of the device. As a country, we need to consider it. If it is good enough for other jurisdictions, we should look at it as well, particularly as winter approaches. I am not saying it is fool-safe or perfect but it is a contribution, particularly in terms of airport testing. We will have to review airport testing as well. </p>
            <p eId="para_682"> The big issue is the resourcing of our medical scientists. We need to ensure that we have enough of them and to do whatever we can to push more of them into this area. We also need to ensure there is adequate laboratory space to enable us to do what we need to do. We need to prioritise those who need testing, be that through self-referral or a more streamlined referral system and tally that with this type of population general testing around the country, particularly at airports, and then we will have a more robust regime. I would 100% support a proposal in that next over the next few weeks or months.</p>

            <p eId="para_687">I thank the Deputy for raising the question. As outlined in the recently published programme for Government, the Government is committed to improving services and supports for people with disabilities, including those with autism.  </p>
            <p eId="para_688"> The HSE has established a national autism spectrum disorder programme board with the key responsibility of leading the implementation of the recommendations of the 2018 review of the Irish health services for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The board has been tasked with leading out on an agreed set of priorities which will have the greatest impact in terms of improving how services can be delivered to people with autism spectrum disorder. I wish to advise the Deputy that while the work of the board was partly paused in March of this year, it will recommence at the end of this month. My ministerial colleague, Deputy O'Gorman and I, have also written to the Ceann Comhairle's office asking that priority be given to the establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee on disability matters. This committee would be an important interface between the various stakeholders, the HSE and public representatives and could provide an open forum for all those concerned, including people with autism spectrum disorder, their families and other interested stakeholders to address issues relevant to them and voice their concerns.   </p>
            <p eId="para_689"> In light of the comprehensive actions I have outlined here, the establishment of an Oireachtas committee on autism is not being considered at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_690">In April 2019, Deputy Funchion moved a motion in this House calling for an autism empowerment strategy and the establishment of an autism committee. The motion received widespread party support at that time. A commitment was given to deliver an autism empowerment strategy for Ireland. The issues affecting autistic children and adults are long-standing and families, children and adults have been battling for years for their basic rights and entitlements. Children face lengthy waiting times for assessments, they struggle to locate appropriate school places and autistic adults face huge gaps in the provision of crucial services, particularly in regard to finding work, securing social welfare or living independently. This is totally unacceptable and it needs to change. A stand-alone autism committee would bring that change.</p>

            <p eId="para_691">We did incredibly well to ensure we had a full-time committee on disabilities established and I ask the Deputy to write to its proposed new Chairman to outline her requests and see if they can form part of the work programme and the committee's planned schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_692"> In order to lead implementation, the HSE set up the national autism spectrum disorder programme, consisting of senior operational and clinical decision makers, as well as independent professional academic support and two individuals with lived experience of autism. The €2 million was secured in budget 2020 for the autism plan and the board was to establish two working groups, one dealing with assessment and pathways and the other to deal with the awareness stream. The pathways group was to help identify a standardised assessment approach for using all autism services and ensure every assessment is accessible and to an agreed standard, regardless of which service is being accessed.</p>

            <p eId="para_693">While I welcome a stand-alone committee dealing with disabilities, I do not see autism as a disability; I see it as a different ability, I suppose. There was agreement that the State was failing children with autism and their families and we saw many cases where children's hours were being cut at school because they did not have the proper services or resources available. In many cases children did not attend school at all as a result. We all agreed that was a national scandal at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_694"> The failure to make a diagnosis in adequate time for school applications and the lack of places available for autistic children in autism spectrum disorder classes amounts to a denial of a child's right to education. These factors have created a two-tier system in our education sector. It is important that we consider this matter. I take the point about writing to the new committee Chairman detailing my points. I thank the Minister of State for her answer.</p>

            <p eId="para_695">The Deputy will be aware that last week, we announced €7.8 million for assessment of needs. As Minister of State with responsibility for disability, I note autism plays a major role within that responsibility and will be one of the key drivers in my work on the programme for Government. To all those who may be listening to proceedings this evening, the Deputy is correct; there was and is a national scandal involving children being sent home from school and not accessing full hours. I agree completely with the Deputy on that. We must review the standard operating procedures for the assessment of needs to ensure it amounts to more than just assessment and there is intervention at the other end.</p>

            <p eId="para_697">I send my best wishes to the Minister for Health and thank the Minister of State for stepping in this evening. My question is about Belmullet hospital, which serves almost 10,000 people. I want the Minister of State to explain to me the logic of refusing direct referrals from GPs in the area. Patients are being asked to travel 100 miles to 150 miles in a round trip to stay a night in the acute facilities at Mayo University Hospital before they can be referred back to Belmullet hospital. It makes no sense whatever and is absolutely crazy. Why is this done and when will the practice be stopped?</p>

            <p eId="para_698">I would like to correct the record. Speaking earlier, I may have inadvertently put the figures the wrong way around when I should have said there were 357 cases of Covid-19 and three deaths arising from the virus today.</p>
            <p eId="para_699"> I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh for her question, which refers to Belmullet.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, has developed an extensive body of guidance and support tools on resident transfers and admissions, which as we all know are available on the HPSC website. The guidance sets out the measures that should be adopted for admissions to residential facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_700"> Belmullet district hospital is a step-down facility supporting acute hospital discharges.  It had a bed capacity of 20 but now has a reduced capacity of 12 beds. The eight beds were unoccupied at the time the reduction took place.  Admissions to the district hospital must comply with the infection prevention and control guidance issued by the HPSC.</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> The HSE has advised the Department that all measures put in place in Belmullet are in order to adhere to Covid-19 infection protection control guidelines to maximise patient safety.  There are no direct admissions from the community to any district hospital across the board since the commencement of the Covid-19 emergency surge in March 2020. I understand the Deputy's point, as more often than not cases like this involve an older person who may have to be transferred to Mayo to spend a night in the acute hospital before being transferred back. However, since the onset of Covid-19 no person is being transferred directly to a community hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> In March or April of this year, while on the other side of this House, I would have raised many times the fact that many patients were transferred to nursing homes without being adequately tested for Covid-19. It was a major factor in the number of older people we lost.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">I do not accept that. Why are we sending somebody on a trip of 100 miles or 150 miles to an acute hospital before sending that person back? Covid-19 was in Mayo University Hospital as well. Yesterday we had the example of a 95-year-old man who could have been catheterised by a GP and admitted to Belmullet hospital in his local area but instead he was forced to go to Mayo University Hospital, where he took up an acute bed. It was completely unnecessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_704"> In the hospital itself the X-ray, chiropody and physiotherapy services have been cut. In Erris we believe Covid-19 is being used as an excuse to shut all the services. Belmullet had 40 beds before the Deputy's party cut that number in half. Now the Government is coming along again to cut that number. The only thing that will convince us in Erris that the Government is in any way genuine about us having a hospital and services in the area is if capital is put into them. Doing that will give us the hospital we need in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_705"> I ask the Minister to be honest with us. This is like death by a thousand cuts so please be honest with us about what is going on.</p>

            <p eId="para_706">Covid-19 is a reality and we are living with it on a daily basis. As I stated, we had 357 cases today, with three people losing their lives. I do not believe that for any reason a medical person would ask somebody to travel that distance unless absolutely necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> I have said that no community hospital around the country is taking direct admissions currently. This is best practice and a change in this process will be decided by NPHET and people above my pay grade. I am also aware the HSE has advised a number of specific challenges for Belmullet hospital, including infrastructure issues with the building, which were highlighted by an infection control review and a HIQA inspection of the facility. Infection prevention and control is now paramount and we want to ensure the safety of all patients. This is the reason people are not being admitted directly to community hospitals and are instead attending acute hospitals first.</p>

            <p eId="para_708">I thank the Minister of State but I still do not believe this is not being used as an excuse. We have excellent staff in Belmullet hospital and it has the required facilities. We needed some minor works done and it has taken over a year to recruit staff for that. There is a line of matters that are unacceptable. Why is the eye clinic finished at Belmullet and what excuse is there for it? There is always one excuse after another given for services not being provided in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> This runs completely against the concepts in Sláintecare, as the Minister of State knows. I know we are living in different times but it makes no sense whatever to take out all these services. The Minister of State mentioned carers earlier but there is no respite or clapping for them. It is not the case that their shift will finish at 8 p.m. and their work is 24-7. The Government has nothing to offer the people of Erris when it comes to health services. We are undermining GPs. Why do we not have proper testing and tracing in order that we can make referrals to the hospital? I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister to look at this again.</p>

A meeting was scheduled to take place this afternoon in Belmullet district hospital between personnel from HSE estates, the chief officer of community healthcare west and the head of services for older people services in order to review the infrastructural deficits within the district hospital and to assess and quantify the levels of work required to address these structural deficits. An action plan has been developed locally to address the issues identified at the district hospital in the HIQA report other than the infrastructural issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_714">This is a very simple question. It could even asked in less than 30 seconds. I wish to ascertain the reason for the sudden, rapid and worrying increase in cases of Covid-19 throughout the country, and to ask what research has been carried out into this.</p>

            <p eId="para_715">I thank Deputy Durkan for his question and for his ongoing support for the public health measures that have been put in place in recent months. While the Government has today launched a new roadmap for the period ahead, as the Deputy points out, following the protocols on hand sanitisation, social distancing and reduction in interactions is still the most important thing to do. </p>
            <p eId="para_716"> It is important to remember that Covid-19 is a highly infectious disease. The risk of getting Covid-19 is now part of our daily lives and will remain so for the foreseeable future. The most important actions we can take to interrupt person-to-person transmission are regular hand-washing, good respiratory hygiene and maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 m, that is, 6 ft, between oneself and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_717"> I am satisfied that the protective public health measures referred to by the Deputy have met with widespread acceptance and buy-in on the part of the Irish public.  I have witnessed inspirational solidarity and co-operation among the vast majority of our citizens, who are following public health advice in order to protect themselves and the most vulnerable in our society.</p>
            <p eId="para_718"> Encouragingly, the most recent public opinion polling conducted by Amárach Research on behalf of my Department indicated that as of Monday, 7 September, there continues to be a good degree of observance of the Covid-19 protocols. This research found that the rate of compliance with the public health guidelines is continuing at a high level. Compliance stood at 95% in regard to hand-washing; 94% in respect of the use of hand sanitiser; 94% in respect of the practice of social distancing; and 83% in respect of coughing into the elbow. Compliance in regard to the wearing of face coverings was at 89% overall, with 93% of those surveyed using face coverings when shopping and 98% wearing them when using public transport. The research also indicates that most people are planning to continue to adhere to these protocols in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_719"> I can also advise the Deputy that 93% of those surveyed state that they follow the recommendations of my Department and the HSE to prevent the spread of the Covid-19. Moreover, it is good to see that younger people have the highest compliance rate of 95% when questioned about wearing masks in public.</p>

            <p eId="para_720">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I am a little bit worried because the figures seem to be going in the wrong direction at a time when the authorities are rightly placing greater emphasis on the need to curtail the virus. It was not evident from the Minister's reply but there must be some identifiable clue as to where the biggest problem is. It has been suggested to me that there is not a great deal of compliance in some quarters, and that meetings, house parties and other gatherings continue to create problems. I am concerned at the effects of bringing people together at different locations and times. I know the new roadmap is going to deal with this but I have to say it is worrying, and I hope the authorities know what needs to be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_721">I should first state that I have received information that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, does not have Covid-19. I wish him well. It was an honour to be able to step in for him but it is good to know that the Minister does not have the virus. As the Deputy is aware, the virus only needs a small window of opportunity to re-emerge. For everyone's sake, especially the most vulnerable, it is therefore critical to keep the transmission of the virus within the community to the absolute minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_722"> Deputy Durkan referred to house parties. This is an issue and the reopening of wet pubs is also causing some concern. However, I hope we will be able to work with all stakeholders to address these concerns. As the Deputy will know, a large number of outbreaks occurred in his own county of Kildare, as well as in Laois and Offaly. Those outbreaks spread rapidly within specific workplace settings such as meat plants. In recent weeks these outbreaks have been dealt with but the Deputy is right to say that we must be very vigilant.</p>

            <p eId="para_723">I thank the Minister of State. I agree. We in County Kildare have been in the eye of the storm for some time and we have paid a high price for it. The second lockdown was quite invasive and created significant economic difficulty but the outbreak was dealt with, albeit at great cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_724"> The national figures are now accelerating at what I would regard as an alarming rate and I am not so certain that we have identified the causes. While the Minister of State's reply was made in good faith, I would like some more information on the direction we are heading. I know the wearing of masks is very important. It seems these guidelines are being adhered to. Why, then, is the virus accelerating? There is a contradiction somewhere that I cannot figure out. Better brains than mine are addressing that issue. I ask that they do so as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_725">The Government shares the Deputy's concerns. The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, meets on a regular basis. It reviews current restrictions based on the most up-to-date information and advises the Government accordingly. It is impossible to accurately predict the future trajectory of Covid-19 in Ireland. As the Deputy knows, there is no precedent for dealing with a pandemic such as this. As such, it is impossible to provide assurances that it is safe to lift the public health restrictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_726"> We are looking at this on a case-by-case basis. Some stricter measures may need to be introduced in the event of a strong upsurge in infections. This is worrying but I understand that NPHET is monitoring the situation very closely. </p>

            <p eId="para_729">I welcome the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler, Rabbitte and Feighan, to the House. Having waited eight years for a Minister to champion their primary care centre, the people of Finglas will be delighted that three Ministers of State have come along all at once. This project dates back to 2012. The HSE, local GPs, elected representatives and the community all agree on the need for a primary care centre. The budget and plans were in place and the HSE proceeded, despite being advised by local representatives that planning difficulties would arise on the site suggested. Unfortunately An Bord Pleanála, the independent body making the decision, refused planning permission for that site. There was an unsatisfactory delay of almost eight years in the HSE's identification of a new site but the partnership of Dublin City Council and the local parish has now reached that point. I ask the Department of Health to do everything it can to expedite this. The people of Finglas want to see a fire lit under this project. They want to see it delivered.</p>

            <p eId="para_731">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of the provision of a primary care centre in Finglas. The development of primary care is central to the Government's objective of delivering a high-quality, integrated and cost-effective healthcare system.</p>
            <p eId="para_732"> As the Deputy is aware, Finglas has been identified as a location for the development of a primary care centre. As he pointed out, approval for a HSE direct-build primary care centre was granted in 2012. Following review of several sites in the area, a Dublin City Council-owned property on Mellowes Road, Finglas, was identified as the preferred site. Subject to planning permission, the commercial terms for the sale were agreed with officials of Dublin City Council and approved by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_733"> The planning permission was appealed to An Bord Pleanála, where an inspector upheld the Dublin City Council decision. However, in February 2015 An Bord Pleanála took the unexpected decision not to grant planning permission for the Finglas primary care centre due to the loss of informal open space.</p>
            <p eId="para_734"> Following this refusal, HSE estates, in conjunction with local primary care services teams, identified an alternative site for a new primary care centre in Finglas and initiated discussions with Dublin City Council in respect of purchasing the site on terms agreeable to both parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">  Feasibility studies on the site are still progressing.  The HSE will be tendering for the services of a design team to progress the proposed project to completion in the near future, subject to agreeable conclusion to the site purchase.</p>

            <p eId="para_736">I appreciate the Minister of State outlining some of the difficulties with the site, but it is clearly water long under the bridge since 2012. What people want to know now is, first, when will the design team be initiated? I appreciate that the Minister of State confirmed it will be appointed, but when will that be done? Second, is the funding in the capital programme to deliver this project? There is no reason that should not be the case. As the Minister of State noted, there is great need for this service. All of the people whom the Minister of State serves, whether they be children with disabilities, older people or those with mental health or addiction issues, will benefit from this site being developed. I ask each of the Ministers of State present to use their influence within the Department and with the Minister, with whom I have previously raised this issue, to do all they can for the people of Finglas.</p>

The HSE will be tendering for the services of a design team to progress the proposed project to completion in the near future, subject to agreeable conclusion to the site purchase. The HSE advised that discussions with Dublin City Council regarding the proposed primary care centre were delayed due to the pandemic but have recently reconvened in an effort to conclude the site purchase from the council on terms agreeable to both parties. I understand the Deputy's concerns regarding this primary care centre. I have seen such centres in many other areas and know they are of great benefit. They make a significant difference to the areas in which they are located. I know Finglas and that the people of Finglas and the surrounding area deserve a state-of-the-art building such as this one. I genuinely believe the Government will progress it and that the funding will be there.</p>

We have a very strong team in the Department, led by the Minister and the Ministers of State.

Primary care centres offer clear benefits such as bringing healthcare professionals together to operate as multidisciplinary teams in purpose-designed, well-equipped and high-quality modern facilities. This centre will be the focal point for many local health initiatives. I again thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue. I hope the people of Finglas and the surrounding area will have their much-needed primary care centre in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_744">The Minister, along with the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, is committed to improving services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives. This year, the HSE will provide more than 8,300 residential places to people with disabilities and will continue working with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_745"> On the residential care facility in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, I understand that the premises was developed by Respond housing agency in partnership with Monaghan County Council. As the Deputy will be aware, the HSE has been working to make the building operational as a residential care facility for people in the region who have physical or sensory disabilities within the resources available to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_746"> I am informed that the HSE undertook a procurement process for an external service provider to run the facility and an organisation was identified, but at a cost that exceeded the budget available. I  understand the HSE intends to seek the additional funding required to open this group home through the 2021 Estimates process. In the interim, outstanding minor works relating to the building remain the subject of engagement between the HSE and Respond.</p>

            <p eId="para_748">The Minister of State has no way of knowing how frustrating his answer is. This issue dates back to the early 2000s, when the families of a group of young women with physical and sensory disabilities first sought for it to be addressed. Those young people had been cared for in their homes all their lives, but their parents were getting older. They approached the health authorities and the local housing services to seek a long-term solution to their needs. Since then, they have met delay after delay and experienced consternation after consternation. Throughout the planning process, one obstacle after another was put in their way. If it was not for the doggedness of the parents of these young people, the building would never have reached completion. It has now been complete for several years and in each of those years, the response which the Minister of State just read out has been returned to the families. They are told that the Government will see whether the project can be included in the Estimates for next year. The Minister is not present, but three Ministers of State at the Department of Health are. I ask them to bring the clear message to the Minister that this issue will not go away. I will raise it at every opportunity available to me until a Minister takes responsibility, grabs the HSE by the scruff of the neck and opens the house in question for these people.</p>

Agreement was reached that a list of minor works would be compiled with HSE estates and forwarded to Respond for consideration. Discussions have taken place with the family of a potential resident and the HSE has submitted the remedial works plan required to the Respond housing agency to request agreement on which remedial works the latter will fund.

It makes no sense that it would be the source of any delay. I ask the Ministers of State to request that the Minister, when he is back on his feet, ensure that meeting be facilitated such that we can get this building operational in the interests of these people who have very severe disabilities and whose families want them to have as independent lives as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_757">I congratulate Deputy Carthy on his appointment as the Sinn Féin spokesperson on agriculture, food and the marine and wish him well in that role. I look forward to working with the Deputy. It is good to be able to be here to take questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_758"> In the context of the Deputy's question on the Department's role in meat plants during the Covid-19 period, the Government categorised farming and food production as essential services under the Covid-19 regulations. As the Deputy will be aware, Irish meat plants and other food plants have continued to operate to ensure continuity and security of food to consumers at home and abroad during this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_759"> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's statutory responsibility in the context of meat plants is to ensure that the Department approved plants operate in compliance with the EU's food hygiene legislation, animal health and animal welfare standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_760"> Within my Department, approximately 250 veterinary and technical staff are routinely involved in supervising, regulating and controlling the food safety, animal health and animal welfare standards at 49 slaughter plants and a large number of meat processing plants throughout the country. Department staff resources are supplemented by a group of approximately 700 temporary veterinary inspectors, who are private veterinary practitioners contracted by the Department to deliver ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection of animals and poultry in meat plants.</p>
            <p eId="para_761"> This work carried out by my staff in meat plants in relation to food hygiene, animal health and animal welfare has continued during the Covid-19 period.</p>
            <p eId="para_762"> In addition to this work, the Department staff in meat plants have assisted and supported the HSE and the food business operators at local level as required in relation to dealing with any outbreaks that have occurred in meat plants and in assisting with the logistics of organising and implementing Covid-19 testing in meat plants which is ongoing at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_763"> The Department staff have also supported and assisted the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, by carrying out Covid-19-related inspections in food plants in accordance with a memorandum of understanding signed between the Department and the HSA. All Department approved meat plants have had at least one such inspection, and inspections are ongoing. To date, the findings and feedback from my staff in respect of these inspections have, in general, indicated good compliance levels.</p>

            <p eId="para_764">I thank the Minister for that response. To put on the record, I continue to support the idea that the food processing sector should have special status in the context of the restrictions that are in place. Of course, that sector needed to operate throughout the Covid-19 period. With that allowance, through even the deepest lockdown period comes a responsibility. The Minister would know of and, I think, at different points, would have shared in my critiques of the lack of transparency and apparent lack of accountability that was occurring within that sector. In many respects, it has been left up to the Minister's officials to be the eyes and ears of the public to ensure that our food is up to standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_765"> I will ask the Minister one question at this stage in relation to temporary veterinary inspectors, TVIs. The Minister will be aware of this letter that TVIs over 70 years of age have been asked to sign which, essentially, waives any health protections to which they might be entitled. I wonder if the Minister could tell me how many TVIs have signed this letter since the Covid period began.</p>

            <p eId="para_766">I do not have that figure to hand. This matter was not alluded to in the Deputy's question. However, I take this opportunity to recognise the tremendous work that those departmental staff and everyone else working in meat factories have done during difficult period. As we have seen in terms of the numbers infected, they have continued to work at great risk to themselves. The Government, working with all agencies, takes its responsibility seriously. As Minister, I certainly take seriously the responsibility of ensuring that every safety protocol is properly followed in order to ensure that best practice is in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_767"> In the context of inspections, there were 26 HSA inspections in August, 25 of which were unannounced. It is important that this process of inspection continues. Of course, we see the serial testing continuing as well, at the best capacity that is allowed depending on the resource levels required within the community at the same time. That testing continued this week, and will be continuing tomorrow also.</p>

            <p eId="para_768">The Minister will recall that, on Wednesday morning last, he indicated on RTÉ radio he that serial testing was continuing but it then transpired that the HSE had made a decision the day before that it should cease. I wonder if the Minister could indicate when he was informed that serial testing had been suspended and outline exactly how many factories will see serial testing being rolled out this week, particularly in light of the concerns that have been expressed and given that the Government acknowledges that this testing has had a role to play in tackling the Covid pandemic. As the Minister will be aware, there is a considerable amount of distrust within the communities about the information that comes directly from the meat factories and yet when it comes to the cases and instances of Covid-19, we depend entirely on the meat factories or media sources to get any information. The process has been slow. In fact, when Deputy McConalogue was on this side of the Chamber, he would have heard the then Ministers for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Agriculture, Food and the Marine indicating that they could not even divulge the number of HSA tests being conducted because of confidentiality rules even though that information was released the following day. The Minister will understand why there is confusion and concern. I hope he will be the Minister to put an end to that.</p>

            <p eId="para_769">As Minister, I take my responsibility very seriously, as the Department does, with regard to working with the HSE and with other agencies in terms of ensuring that the best practices are in place at meat factories and that serial testing takes place as quickly as possible. One of the first actions I took following my appointment as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine was to seek an immediate meeting with Meat Industry Ireland to ensure that co-ordination between the HSE, the Department and the meat industry was clear and that there was a clear timeline in relation to testing taking place. This is a matter of which I have kept abreast of every day since. I was interviewed on the Claire Byrne show on Wednesday morning last and gave the most up-to-date information I had at that point. The Department had been informed the night before by the HSE that testing had been temporarily postponed. I had not had a chance to be briefed that morning before the radio interview that the HSE had taken that decision. However, I have kept abreast of how that is progressing every day. I am doing everything possible within my Department to work with them to ensure that continues. The objective is to ensure, resources allowing, that serial testing will continue, that the first series will be finalised and that testing will continue to roll out on a fortnightly basis after that.</p>

          </question>

            <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T21:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_771">I am fully committed to supporting and developing Ireland’s beef sector, which plays an important role in sustaining the rural economy and rural communities across Ireland. I am well aware of the particular importance of suckler farming in this regard. The beef sector has many strengths and one way of capitalising on these is through the means available under the EU geographical indications schemes, which highlight to consumers the value adding characteristics of a given product carrying a geographical indication logo.</p>
            <p eId="para_772"> The Deputy will be aware of the draft application by Bord Bia for a protected geographical indication, PGI, for Irish grass fed beef, which focuses on the reputation of high quality beef produced through Ireland’s grass-based production systems.  This application seeks to capture the benefit of the PGI status for Irish beef, which has earned a reputation as a high quality product, based on our grass-fed production systems. It has been drafted with a view to bringing the benefits of PGI status for the beef output of as many Irish farms as possible, while remaining consistent with the requirements of the EU PGI regulation.  </p>
            <p eId="para_773"> The product specification, as drafted, would ensure that the vast majority of Irish suckler beef production would qualify for the PGI status if the application is successful. Successful registration of the name would endorse and build on the already identifiable reputation and image of Irish beef in the marketplace and provide potential benefits to all producers meeting the specification, including the protection of Irish beef from imitation. </p>
            <p eId="para_774"> As part of the procedure for developing the application, a national opposition procedure was launched whereby groups or individuals could submit their suggestions and observations on the proposal over a period of four weeks.  This procedure concluded on Friday, 11 September and submissions will now be examined by my officials.  There will be further opportunity for discussion with stakeholders following this, including at the upcoming meeting of the beef task force.</p>
            <p eId="para_775"> It is important that there is a strong partnership to get agreement on suckler beef PGI status. The farming organisations have given their views and it is important that there be strong consultation with them. My firm intention is to do this, notably through the beef task force. </p>

            <p eId="para_776">I met representatives of Bord Bia on Zoom today, with my colleague from the Northern Assembly, Mr. Declan McAleer, MLA. My primary question to Bord Bia, which was not very forthright in giving an answer, was why the scheme was being led by Bord Bia. It is very unusual that a promotion body as opposed to a producer body would lead an application for PGI status.</p>
            <p eId="para_777"> A second concern is that the potentially very broad nature of the scheme Bord Bia is pursuing could mean that some suckler farmers will not be eligible, whereas other types of beef, which are very good quality but do not have the same natural qualities and saleablity as suckler cattle, will be eligible.</p>
            <p eId="para_778"> I am very worried that farmers a few miles from me will not be able to participate in the scheme because it is partitionist. It is not an all-island scheme and the Minister, who is also from a Border county, is aware of the importance of promoting the all-Ireland nature of Irish agriculture.</p>

            <p eId="para_779">The Deputy's point on the potential for an all-island scheme is one that I am very open to exploring. We had a very constructive engagement with the Northern Ireland agriculture minister, Mr. Edwin Poots, during the week. There is strong potential for looking at how we collaborate and an all-island brand. Our tremendous grass-fed product is well established as is the tremendous contribution made by suckler beef. Everyone's objective is to try to maximise the price we get for that quality product on international markets and achieve a premium for it. In conducting its research, Bord Bia's objective was to ensure that the PGI that is finally agreed, submitted and approved will be one that is attractive to the consumers to whom we wish to sell it and achieves a good price.</p>

            <p eId="para_780">I was in Inishowen in the Minister's constituency, very close to the Minister's home place yesterday, although I did not call in for tea. I am sure the Minister has heard and understands the concern of farmers in his area, as well as in my home county, that rather than PGI status being a stream by which additional revenue and income will be delivered, which should be the priority for our farmers who are most at risk - our suckler farmers - it will become another excuse for the factories to pay less where the PGI standard is not met. The crux of this is that the scheme is so broad that it will result in the few farmers who do not meet the standard suffering a penalty as opposed to everyone securing an increase in price. Irish suckler beef is the best quality beef in the world but this has not been reflected in the prices that Irish suckler farmers have received. This scheme has the potential to resolve that problem but I am not sure it will.</p>

            <p eId="para_781">The voice of farmers is one that I take very seriously and is central to my considerations. The engagement with the beef task force is coming up and I will ensure that there are bilateral talks in advance of it between departmental officials and farm organisations. It is essential that there is a proper examination of the potential for this proposed PGI scheme. The research conducted on consumer markets and what appeals to consumers will be central to how we go about this in order that we leverage the best price possible for the very high quality product we are producing.</p>
            <p eId="para_782"> As Minister, I look forward to bringing this forward. I will engage with farmers and take on board their views and the market research conducted by Bord Bia, which is always important in how we market Irish food abroad and will be important as we seek to get a premium. I give the House a clear assurance that I see tremendous value in trying to get people behind a PGI, which the sector and all stakeholders can support. It will ensure we can market strongly abroad and build on Ireland's already strong reputation.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_787">Ensure fairness, equity, and transparency in the food chain by establishing a new authority called the National Food Ombudsman (NFO) to enforce the Unfair Trading Practices Directive. This new authority will enforce EU wide rules on prohibited unfair trading practices in the food supply chain and will have powers to enforce this Directive, penalising those who breach regulations. The NFO will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland. </p>
            <p eId="para_788">Directive (EU) No. 2019/633, the unfair trading practices directive, must be transposed into Irish law by 1 May 2021.  This can be done by way of a statutory instrument but any measures that extend beyond the minimum harmonisation requirements of the unfair trading practices directive will require primary legislation. For this reason, I propose to adopt a two-step approach to this commitment.  First, my officials are drafting a proposal for a statutory instrument to directly transpose the unfair trading practices directive as it stands. Second, the legal requirements for the establishment of a new office of a food ombudsman are also being considered, including the requirement for primary legislation to give that office additional powers going beyond those in the unfair trading practices directive.</p>

From my perspective, I emphasise the need for the food ombudsman to be an independent office with the statutory powers to enforce the directive as outlined. We have seen in recent months that we have to protect primary producers and small suppliers so that large retailers and conglomerates do not abuse their dominant position in the market. From my perspective, the independence of that office is crucial. If there is anything I can do with the Minister's office, I will engage constructively to expedite that process as well as I can.</p>

We will look at how we can make sure the office is independent and has the remit to ensure it can carry out the role of bringing transparency and confidence to the system. We want to rebuild that relationship and, in particular, the primacy of the primary producers to make sure they get the best crack of the whip possible to deliver an income and return for them and their work, which should be properly reflected in the price they get in the international markets where 90% of our produce goes, as well as domestically.</p>

With regard to the beef exceptional aid measure farmers have to reduce their stocking densities. They are given a stocking density as an annual figure, which is confusing not just to farmers but to those who advise them.

            <p eId="para_793">The objective of the beef exceptional aid measure was to provide temporary exceptional adjustment aid to farmers in the beef sector in Ireland subject to the conditions set out in the European Commission implementing regulation.  This aid was granted to provide temporary market adjustment support in response to a specific market disturbance as outlined in Ireland's notification to the European Commission.  As part of the notification and approval process for the measure, the 5% reduction was part of the conditionality sought by the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_794"> Approved BEAM participants have given a commitment to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their farms by 5% for the period from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021, compared with the period from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019.  The most recent analysis of nitrates trends in participating herds indicates that two thirds of participants have already started to make adjustments to reduce their nitrates, with almost half the participants meeting that 5% reduction already.</p>
            <p eId="para_795"> Participants can access their most recent nitrates figures via the exceptional aid measure link when they log in to <i>agfood.ie</i>. Following recent discussions with stakeholders, provision is now being made to display the updated figure monthly, as Deputy McNamara suggests. This change will allow participating farmers to more accurately monitor the effect changes they have made on their farm have had on their nitrates figures.  The Department's staff have made arrangements for the relevant data to be generated and the changes to the online display to provide monthly updates is expected to be in place for the start of November. Participants who need advice on how to manage their reduction can contact the Department or consult an agricultural adviser to work out which changes will make most sense on their farm.</p>

I will use the limited time available to me to address this idea of a protected geographical indication, PGI. It is all well and good but all of the schemes that Bord Bia has promoted have worked not to the benefit of producers but solely to the benefit of processors. They are all being used to hammer prices. This nationwide PGI, while a good idea in theory, will be just one more thing that farmers will be penalised by processors for not adhering to. Further, it will make it harder for individual farmers who wish to register a PGI, because there will be one PGI register for the whole country which will be in the control of processors rather than producers. The whole PGI mechanism, be it in Ireland, Italy or any other country in Europe, is about a product. It gives control to producers. I am not surprised that it is happening this way in Ireland because it is the way that the Department and Bord Bia work. They give power to processors rather than producers. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind when developing a PGI, so he does not just give more power to beef cartels.</p>

            <p eId="para_797">I thank Deputy McNamara for his contribution. I assure him that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with me and the Ministers of State, Deputy Heydon and Senator Hackett, will work to get the best possible return for farmers and their work. We will work with State agencies and all in the sector to ensure that is the case. That is why we are taking the initiative with regard to the food ombudsman and why I think there is merit in developing a PGI. It is important that it is done in a co-ordinated way and properly marketed and driven. Effort and resources must be put into this PGI, once it is hopefully agreed in partnership, to ensure it is properly marketed abroad, connects to the consumer and delivers the greatest possible return. It will not be a silver bullet but hopefully it can be a significant help. We need to leverage it to make sure it delivers in the best way possible for the beef sector. I am not sure from the Deputy's response whether he thinks a PGI is a good idea, as such.</p>

            <p eId="para_802">I did not realise that. I would not have interrupted so rudely if I had known I had another minute. I think PGIs are an excellent idea but they are about producer groups, not a nationwide development that will be held hostage by processors who completely control the Irish beef industry. I know there have been complaints to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, and the only people who were not investigated were in the beef industry. Farmers were investigated and farmers' groups were investigated, but the processors themselves, bizarrely, were not. I do not know what sort of hold beef processors have on this country but it is substantial and it covers officialdom. PGIs are an excellent idea, as is the quality assurance scheme but all the latter does is empower processors to pay farmers less. It is never about farmers being able to say that they produce a high quality product and should get more money for it, but about processors saying that the bullock, heifer or sheep is a day over a particular age or has too much or too little fat.</p>

            <p eId="para_803">I assure the Deputy that the objective of this PGI is to try to improve the lot of farmers and to ensure that we market, develop and make the most of the tremendous product we have, and that we can help to sell that message to consumers through the PGI. We aim not only to increase the volume that we sell but also the value of what we sell. We should ensure that it is followed through on with marketing afterwards. The key objective of the national food ombudsman, which contributes to the point the Deputy has made, is to bring transparency to the food supply chain, and especially to ensure there is always an eye on what is available on the international markets. The international markets determine the price that is available and we sell into those markets. We need to ensure our farmers get a price domestically that reflects the markets that processors are selling into. The intention would be that, through the national food ombudsman, we can ensure there is transparency and a fair deal for farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_806">The Mackinnon report, which was carried out by Jim Mackinnon, the former chief planner of the Scottish Government, reviewed the forestry approval process and related issues in Ireland.  This was similar to an exercise which Mr. Mackinnon had previously conducted for the Scottish authorities. It was published at the end of last year and presented to the forestry programme implementation group in January.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">Its implementation is one of the commitments which the Government made for forestry in the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_808"> The report was informed by, among other things, discussions with a range of stakeholders including the forestry sector, farming organisations, the environmental pillar, State bodies, Teagasc and the Forestry Appeals Committee. In addition, written submissions were received at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_809"> The report includes 22 ways forward or recommendations across a range of issues. I am pleased to say that many of these recommendations have already been taken on board by my Department and acted upon. We are, for instance, in line with the Mackinnon report, introducing an amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act and have issued guidance on Natura impact statements. We have also introduced a single consent system for forestry road planning </p>
            <p eId="para_810"> It is important that the report is implemented in the best way possible and that is why I am currently examining the appointment of an independent chair to oversee the process. The intention is that this person will report on the feasibility of implementing the Mackinnon recommendations for us to consider further. The newly commissioned forestry programme implementation group is to monitor progress and to help deliver on its ambition. A review of the forestry programme implementation group is currently under way to enhance representation in order that the membership of the group is best selected to help advise the Minister, myself and the Department on the implementation of the national programme. </p>
            <p eId="para_811"> There is a significant amount of activity in forestry at the moment especially on the reform of the planning and appeals processes and the introduction of the agriculture appeals (amendment) Bill to the House soon. Nonetheless, I am well aware that implementation of the Mackinnon report is also a priority and I expect to be making further announcements on this issue in the near future. </p>

            <p eId="para_812">I wish the three Ministers, Deputies McConalogue and Heydon and Senator Hackett, the best of luck. It is a privilege to be a Minister. I was a Minister of State for nine years. It is very strange for me to be asking the questions now to a Minister of State after nine years. I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is in the process of appointing an independent chair. I would like to bring her back to November 2019 when one of the headlines in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal </i>was that the lack of political priority for the forestry sector was of major concern. I would like the Minister of State to be able to turn that headline around and say that the forestry sector has absolute political support. Having formerly worked in the forestry sector and whose college was related to the forestry sector, I have a great interest in it. I really believe that the Government can achieve a great deal more than has been achieved in the past. There are some decisions that the Minister of State and her Department can make which would make a very real difference. We are falling way behind in our planting targets. I have no doubt the Minister of State is well aware of that. As she is coming from the Green Party, which is very much the environmental party, I urge her support in this sector. It is really needed.</p>

            <p eId="para_813">I thank the Deputy for his kind words. The Mackinnon report did, indeed, highlight that lack of political priority for forestry. It is something of which I am very aware. We are missing our afforestation targets by a long way. The commitments in the programme for Government were highly ambitious for forestry, far more so than any previous programme. I am really looking forward to getting my forestry implementation group off the ground and starting the process of devising a new forestry programme for Ireland. It will be done with stakeholder engagement and as broad a base as we can achieve. We see the difficulty certain communities have with broad-scale single species afforestation. Those are some of the issues I wish to address. I look forward to engagement with politicians as well as stakeholders in devising that.</p>

            <p eId="para_814">I worked in None-So-Hardy nurseries in County Wicklow. I ask the Minister of State if at all possible in her busy schedule to visit it. Nearly every Minister with responsibility for forestry has visited None-So-Hardy in Wicklow. They have a base in County Wexford as well. If we are to encourage farmers to enter into planting forestry, they have to see that as a seamless process. If they see a process that has delays with decisions from inspectors and so on, they will not be encouraged to go into forestry. I know quite a number of farmers in that position. None-So-Hardy nurseries have dumped millions of trees over the last years because of the lack of planting. They are committing to their side of it, sowing from seedlings and the whole way up but when it gets to planting and to the farmers, there is a serious delay. I ask for the undivided attention of the Minister of State on this specific issue. I ask her, on behalf of the management, to visit None-So-Hardy nurseries in Wicklow or Wexford.</p>

            <p eId="para_816">I share Deputy Kehoe's concerns about delays but I am also glad to hear that the Minister of State is aware of some of the environmental difficulties. The answer is not to get rid of objections but to process them and deal with them quickly and to hire suitably qualified people in the Department to vet these applications. While forestry is extremely important, the type of forestry we are carrying out at the moment does little to benefit our environment. In fact, it is completely detrimental, particularly in the way monoculture is planted, clear-felled and replanted. I invite the Minister of State, before she comes to any final decision, to look at Slieve Aughty. Much of the land is designated as a special protection area, SPA, for hen harriers. Farmers are put to great lengths to protect the habitat for hen harriers and rightly so. They have no objection to that. However, Coillte then comes in, using pesticides for which it has received a derogation, and completely rapes the countryside.</p>

            <p eId="para_819">A good forestry policy, as I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate, should do three things. Obviously it should play a really important role in terms of protecting the environment and carbon emissions. It should also be of benefit to a local community. The forest is something that people should want to live close by to, as opposed to the current position whereby entire communities are rising up against some of the forestry policies. It should bring a benefit to the economy, particularly to the local economy. We have managed to develop a forestry policy in this State that does none of those three things, for reasons I have outlined. There are examples and we are beginning to see spreads of areas where this can be done well. Our forestry policy does not necessarily mean telling farmers they have to plant a certain percentage of their land with trees. They would find their worst land and would plant as many trees as they could on it. We should be encouraging them to have trees planted throughout the farm. The example of the Inishowen uplands project is of a standard that we should try to emulate across the State.</p>

Things have changed, however, even within the past couple of years. We plant things differently from how we used to. There are greater setback distances from roads, or there certainly should be.</p>

            <p eId="para_838"> My Department is also supporting the HSE and the Health and Safety Authority in monitoring the effective implementation of all relevant Covid-19 guidance in Department-approved food plants. International evidence has shown that meat plants in particular are at risk of outbreaks. My Department is leading research on the operational and environmental factors in meat plants which may influence Covid transmission, for example, by looking at ventilation systems and the recirculation of chilled air in plants, to identify and address those risk factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_839"> There has been a lot of commentary about wider factors regarding employees in the food industry, for example, shared accommodation and transport, and the sick pay and other employment conditions for workers. There have been discussions between the meat industry and unions on some of these issues, and that is positive. My Department is leading engagement with the ESRI to scope out a research project looking at these wider issues. If the Deputy has concerns with regard to individual workers, he should report these directly to the relevant statutory agencies such as the Health and Safety Authority, the Workplace Relations Commission, or the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_840"> Specifically on beef sectoral issues, the beef task force that was established in September 2019 provides a forum for detailed engagement on key issues facing the beef sector, and is particularly important in progressing the commitments made by all stakeholders in the beef sector agreement last September. It is independently chaired and includes representatives from all stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_841"> I am aware that I am out of time in my response but I will certainly follow up with the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_842">It appears that the balls always fall right for the meat factories in all of this, and I have said this to the Minister's predecessor. The Minister will recall during the Covid period that Deputy Naughten revealed the factories had received tests results of some of the workers before the workers themselves. The Minister asked if we are aware of any individual concerns around the workers. The workers in a lot of these factories are scared stiff to talk to anybody. We have a situation where the companies operate behind a veil. They are unlimited companies, usually based through myriad schemes in Luxembourg or some other third country. It is incredibly hard to get any answers. When a body agrees to look into matters, as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission did last year, the companies respond with what I can only describe as an insulting letter to those who put the queries, and it was admitted through FOI that they had not actually asked the meat factories any questions. The Minister can see where the concerns are.</p>

            <p eId="para_843">I am aware of the concerns regularly expressed by the farming community and also with the issues around Covid recently. The Deputy will know that in advance of the last election I put forward the policy for a national food ombudsman to address some of those issues. It is included in the programme for Government. Other parties, including the Deputy's, did not have any suggestions in that regard on how to address that issue. I look forward to any ideas Deputy Carthy has, along with all the farming organisations, to try to ensure that office is robust, and which will help to address that issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_844"> The terms and conditions of workers are very important. Workers must be properly protected and looked after. Everything I will do in my Department, and working with other agencies, will be about ensuring that is the case. This is why I will be establishing, and working with the ESRI, a review on how we can learn and try to improve the situation, while working with other Departments also. If there are particular issues which Deputies become aware of, even if not through a specific person, it is important those are fed back. Any issues or situations where people are not being treated properly must be addressed. As the Minister I will do everything I can to ensure that is the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_845">If the Minister is looking for ideas, one is contained within this parliamentary question, which is that the Minster would set up a cross-departmental task force to look at all of these issues. I take the Minister's bona fides on this but the crucial test for the Minister and whatever third bodies are set up is whether his Department continues to see its role in all this as defenders and protectors of the meat factories. That is the perception. I believe this perception is based in reality, and in the role the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has played over the past years. The Department has seen its role as defending the meat factories no matter what, and to defend against all and any allegation or question that is put. The Minister's big challenge is, in the first instance, to break this down within his own Department, to put the right questions to the right people, and to ensure when questions are asked, either by Deputies in this House or by farming organisations, that the questions are answered. For far too long, responses to questions on meat factories have been too slow, if they come at all.</p>

            <p eId="para_846">I have no doubt that Deputy Carthy likes to put forward the narrative that this would be the case in the future. As I have said to him in response to numerous questions, as the Minister I will be respecting everyone in the food supply chain and all stakeholders, and in particular the primacy of the primary producers who have not had a fair crack in relation to transparency or the margins they get, and will be doing the best in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_847"> We must respect everyone, but we also must hold everyone to account.

It will in fact be the final nail in the coffin if the current approaches continue to be taken to maximise the number of beef farmers eligible for PGI status.

            <p eId="para_853">I thank the Deputy for the question.</p>
            <p eId="para_854"> Many of the issues raised by the Deputy at that time, and raised by me and many other Deputies, have fallen under the remit of the beef task force. The beef task force was established in September 2019 and it provides a very constructive forum for detailed engagement on key issues facing the beef sector. It is particularly important in progressing the commitments made by all stakeholders in the beef sector agreement last September. It is independently chaired, and includes representatives from a range of stakeholders, including farm organisations, the meat industry, and my Department and its agencies.  The task force offers a suitable platform for strategic engagement by stakeholders on the opportunities and challenges facing the sector.  I am pleased to say that the task force will meet again before the end of September.</p>
            <p eId="para_855"> Information relating to the work of the task force, including the full text of the agreement of 15 September 2019, and updates on actions arising out of the agreement to date are available on my Department’s website.</p>
            <p eId="para_856"> On market transparency, Grant Thornton has been contracted as consultants to conduct a series of transparency studies on behalf of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">The first is an independent review of market and customer requirements, specifically on the four in-spec bonus criteria currently in operation in the Irish beef sector. The second is an independent examination of the price composition of the total value of the animal, including the fifth quarter, while the third is a summary of competition law issues relevant to the Irish beef sector. An update on the progress of these reports will be provided to the task force at its next meeting at the end of this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_858"> On the draft application for PGI status for Irish beef, this issue was discussed in detail at the last task force meeting in June. Consultation on and development of the draft PGI application by Bord Bia began in early 2019. As part of the procedure for developing the application, a national opposition procedure was launched whereby groups or individuals could submit their suggestions and observations on the proposal over a period of four weeks. This procedure concluded last Friday, 11 September and submissions are now being examined by my officials. There will be further opportunity for discussion with stakeholders following this, including at the upcoming meeting of the beef task force.</p>

            <p eId="para_859">The difficulty is that the agenda here is to shoehorn as much beef as possible into the PGI status application. As the Minister knows, the former Commissioner, Phil Hogan, said that we should be seeking designation specifically for suckler beef. When I raised this with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Creed, in the House last October, he said that the concept of suckler beef does not have a high degree of resonance. However, across a range of food products, including dairy, there is resonance in relation to grass-fed production. The Minister is saying here that he will take into account the market research by Bord Bia but that body has let down the suckler industry in this country. Bord Bia has not promoted Irish suckler beef. It will continue to undermine it and put the money back into the hands of the processing industry unless the Minister stands with, and defends, the suckler producers. He must put a PGI programme in place specifically for the suckler industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_860">Obviously market research is very important in terms of assessing what consumers are looking for and what resonates with them. We must take that into account and I know that Bord Bia has done significant research in that regard. It is really important that PGI status has the support of all stakeholders and that everybody gets behind it, including farmers, the industry and our marketing agencies. We must get behind it and make sure it is supported in terms of advertising so that it can be a success. My objective is to work with all stakeholders to ensure that we take forward the work that has already commenced and get agreement on a PGI status that can add to the value of Irish beef and help us all to market it abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_861">The Minister has heard that the stakeholders on this side of the House are vehemently opposed to the approach that is being taken which, from its inception, was about maximising the amount of beef that could be shoehorned into a PGI application. The Commissioner at the time said it would be unsuccessful. Unless we focus on suckler beef, that will not happen. The difficulty is that Bord Bia has never distinctly promoted suckler beef because that does not suit the processing industry in this country which wants to get a premium price for manufacturing beef.</p>
            <p eId="para_862"> Is the Minister sincere about trying to break up the blockage that is there within the beef sector? I believe he is but he must ask the Tánaiste, who has responsibility for business, enterprise and innovation, under section 10(4) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 to request the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to carry out a market study of the beef industry in this country. That does not require any evidence and can be done at the stroke of a pen. We will see how transparent the industry is at that stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_863">To go back to the point I made earlier and to support the point just made by Deputy Naughten, we are at a very funny stage now. Bord Bia has said that it cannot apply for a distinct PGI for Irish suckler beef, which is the best beef in the world as I said earlier, because naturally-bred Irish suckler beef is not widely recognised in the market. Whose job is it to make sure it is widely recognised in the market?</p>

I want all of our farmers who produce beef to get a good price for their product. However, there is a premium product that comes from a large number of farmers across this State, namely, our suckler farmers but they are not getting a premium. In fact, they are the ones who are operating at a loss and we need to correct that.</p>

Our objective must be to ensure that our high quality beef gets the best price possible and is marketed well abroad. This is important and is something that I have raised with Bord Bia in the past. It is an issue that Bord Bia very much recognises too. It is important to assess the market and where consumers are at, and feed that into how we frame the PGI status application. We must take all the evidence on board, particularly the views of farming representative bodies. We must then ensure that the industry gets behind it and that Government supports it in terms of making sure that it is marketed and promoted. There is more work to be done over the next period of time in advance of the next beef task force meeting. It is my objective to try to get everyone working in partnership to promote Irish beef abroad and to try to get agreement on the PGI status.</p>

            <p eId="para_871">The Strategy for the Inshore Fisheries Sector 2019-2023 is an industry-led strategy, the first of its kind for the Irish inshore fisheries sector. The national inshore fisheries forum finalised the strategy at the start of last year, following what I understand was an extensive development process that also involved the six regional inshore fisheries forums and a steering group with industry and State partners. </p>
            <p eId="para_872"> Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, is leading the implementation of the strategy, in partnership with the national inshore fisheries forum. BIM has advised my Department that the implementation group met last year and identified priority actions under the strategy. The last full meeting of the group was held on 25 November. BIM advises that plans for a subsequent meeting at the end of March were overtaken by the Covid-19 pandemic, like many other things, and it has not proved possible to convene a meeting of the group since then, as the industry has been focused on dealing with the impacts of the pandemic which have been significant. Despite this challenge, BIM has confirmed that work to progress the identified priority actions has continued and it anticipates a meeting of the group may be arranged in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_873"> In the meantime, the chair of the national inshore fisheries forum has formally written to invite me to meet the forum.

            <p eId="para_874">I am sure the Minister will agree that it is absolutely stunning that the last time the implementation group met was November 2019. The whole country has gotten used to conducting meetings online. We have all conducted countless meetings online every day. Could this group not have met online?</p>
            <p eId="para_875"> The aforementioned report refers to an industry-led approach, which was really welcome and which was in stark contrast to the approach adopted 20 years ago. The last time there was a major report like this, the industry was not consulted or involved in its design. Inshore fishing and coastal communities all across this State, which comprise the inshore fishing industry, believe in this report and its potential but they are absolutely struggling. I appeal to the Minister to get a grip on this situation and insist that the group meets as soon as possible to provide him with an implementation plan for this report.</p>

            <p eId="para_876">The important thing to note is that the implementation of the agreed priorities under the strategy has been continuing and it is crucial that it continues. It will certainly be important that a meeting be held promptly to follow on from and to co-ordinate that. It is a very welcome approach. It has been greatly welcomed by the inshore fishermen that this is being led by themselves and that they have had such a stakeholder and leadership role.</p>
            <p eId="para_877"> I take the Deputy’s point that a meeting would be useful in the near future. It is important to note that the work has been continuing despite the fact that, due to Covid, there have not been meetings.

I met them online in recent weeks and they raised a wide range of issues with me. They feel utterly abandoned by the Government with regard to supports during the Covid crisis and the price of produce. I cannot stress enough that they are in crisis. The recent deal between the EU and the US on lobster tariffs is another threat, so there is a range of issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_879"> There is a sense that they signed up to a partnership in this strategy or plan and we hear, one year on, that there have not been meetings of the implementation group and there is no evidence that this report is being implemented.

            <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T22:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_886">I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 122 together. I thank Deputy Browne for his question and congratulate him on his recent election.</p>
            <p eId="para_887"> Herd test history statements and reports are issued to all cattle herdowners with the aim of helping them to reduce the risk of bovine TB in cattle herds. The bovine TB forum interim report identified the need to provide more effective information to farmers to help them reduce the risk of TB in their herd and advocated for the development of herd risk categories that are “simple, clear, and convey sufficient information to enable farmers to make the decisions appropriate to their situation”. Against this background, the Department developed individualised reports that provide a simplified TB herd risk category for farmers, with herd-specific advice on how to reduce risk of TB. </p>
            <p eId="para_888"> There is a large, robust body of scientific evidence on bovine TB and this scientific evidence underpins the advice contained in the herd history statement. Furthermore, the content of the statement is consistent with the advice that has been provided by my Department for several years, including in newsletters, videos, leaflets and other media. Farmers are already provided with information in regard to their TB risk, but this report presents this in a new and user-friendly format. </p>
            <p eId="para_889"> Following many successful years of reducing bovine TB levels to the benefit of the farming community, there has been a concerning incremental increase in the disease since 2016. This has continued in 2020, with further increases in herd incidence and reactor numbers observed. Herd incidence on a 12-month rolling basis has breached 4% for the first time since 2012 and reactor numbers have exceeded 20,000, the highest number since 2009. These trends highlight the need for urgent action by all stakeholders to manage the risk more effectively across all transmission routes. It is this need for action that is my Department’s primary motivation in issuing the herd history statements.</p>
            <p eId="para_890"> While the immediate trends are disappointing and worrying, great progress has been made over the past decade. During 2009, some 5,860 herds were subject to restriction while the number in 2019 was down to 4,060. By working together, we have made progress previously and we need to make progress again. I have listened carefully to the concerns raised by farmers following the issuance of these letters and I am eager to schedule a TB forum meeting as soon as possible to further develop a shared understanding of how, collectively, we can reduce TB incidence. </p>
            <p eId="para_891"> My Department remains committed to reducing TB in Ireland, as demonstrated by the recent sanctioning of an additional 16 officers to assist the TB programme. Attaining TB-free status remains critical from a farm family profitability and sustainability perspective, and from a trade perspective at national and international level. I am acutely conscious that every TB restriction represents a significant challenge to the farm family concerned. It is a deep regret that, today, more than 2,700 herds are currently restricted, which represents a 21% increase on the same time last year. I want to work with all stakeholders to ensure fewer herdowners experience the challenges associated with a TB restriction and that we all work purposefully towards eradication of this disease, thus eliminating this ongoing cost on farmers and the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_892"> Separately, I understand some queries have been raised in respect of GDPR. I know the letters were designed to be in line with European and national legislation, taking account of data that is already available to herdowners. My Department will engage fully with data protection concerns that are raised in regard to the TB letters.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Browne<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T22:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_893">Farmers accept this needs to be tackled. However, in recent times, we have had meetings with farming organisations and all have expressed their concern at the issuing of letters regarding TB herd history. It has angered not just farmers in my constituency but all over the country. They are saying that what the Department has done is to affect the welfare of individual farmers by sending out letters, and many of them believe this leads to the devaluation of their herds. This was all done without any protection being offered to them at a time farm families are really struggling, which is accepted by all in the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_894"> One of the biggest worries they have concerns the implications of GDPR. Will the Minister outline the decision which led to letters being sent out? Will he speak to the farmers who believe their livelihoods may have been damaged as a result? Will he comment on the data protection implications? </p>

            <p eId="para_895">It is not an easy job to unite all of the farm organisations but they are all united in the belief that this was an insensitive and insane move. Notwithstanding Deputy Browne’s valid concerns, people are asking what exactly was the purpose of this, how much it cost and whether it was the case that when the cat is away, the mice will play, given the fluctuation in the ministerial post.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">Would the Minister have allowed this to happen or stood over it if he had been in office at the time? I suspect he would not. I suspect he would have done what the former Minister, Deputy Creed, apparently did which was to say, "Put them back in the drawer as we have better things to be doing at the moment".</p>

            <p eId="para_897">Regarding the background to it, as I outlined, the interim report of the TB forum was important in that regard. That report advocated the development of herd risk categories that are simple, clear and convey sufficient information to enable farmers to make decisions appropriate to their situation. I know farmers have expressed concern about the letters. All of us can unite on the fact that we must address the issue of figures for positive incidences of TB increasing and going in the wrong direction. The people who are penalised and lose most from that are the farmers affected. As I said, 2,700 herds are currently restricted.</p>
            <p eId="para_898"> I am open to ideas on how we can address that, because we must address it to improve the situation for farmers and to work towards reaching a position where we can eradicate TB as we did with brucellosis previously. Another prompt meeting of the TB forum would be a positive move in that regard.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Martin Browne<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T22:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_899">I have to disagree with the Minister. The people who are operating in the sector say it devalues their herds. The letters in question were not agreed in the TB forum, which has to get up and running a great deal better than what is happening. What is concerning is that following recent events farmers need to have confidence in the Department and they just do not have it now. Various organisations have spoken about how the farmers' faith in the Department is being eroded. These letters did little to help that, and I believe the Minister will agree with that. Concern has been expressed that the Department is going ahead with changes to the TB eradication programme that have not been agreed, especially at the forum. Farmers are worried that the Department is falling short in that regard. The measures being taken are out of the farmers' control. Can the Minister tell us what the plan is for the TB forum?</p>

          <speech by="#MattCarthy" eId="spk_471">
            <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T22:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_900">On that point, I challenge the Minister to set a date. I welcome the fact that he has committed to reconvening the forum, but I challenge him to get it done over the next week. This is an area where I happily admit that I do not have all the answers. I do not believe anybody does. The one thing I know is that the current set of policies and procedures is not working. The figures the Minister outlined for 2019 as opposed to 2009 do not show sufficient progress when one considers the millions of euro that have been spent on TB eradication programmes. Much of that funding came directly from the EU and that funding is likely to dry up. What we are likely to get in its place are EU-set policy provisions that might not necessarily work for the Irish family farm network. We have a collective responsibility to find the answers and to tackle TB in a way that does not penalise our farmers but ensures we move to the point the Minister outlined. He will have our full support on that but I believe we must have a complete re-think.</p>

            <p eId="para_901">There are not many coming forward with the answers, but we need answers. That is why I am calling a meeting of the TB forum. Nobody suffers more than farmers when herds are restricted. Farmers experience stress when they are facing a test, particularly if they have gone down in the test in recent times. There is also the cost impact on them. It is incumbent on all of us in the Oireachtas and on the farming stakeholders and primary representative organisations to work together to turn the dial in the other direction, to start to get on top of this disease again and to work towards its eradication. Certainly, the current trajectory is going in the opposite direction, and that is in nobody's interest. The reason I am calling a meeting of the TB forum is to get people together. We need the answers and we must get people behind it. How we go about it might not necessarily be easy, but we must be clear and united in the objective, which is to improve the situation for farmers, to eradicate this disease and to eradicate its massive cost to farmers. I certainly hope that in calling the stakeholders together in the TB forum we can start to move in that direction.</p>

            <p eId="para_903">Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire. My question relates to the interim measures. It is clear there will not be a CAP for a number of years. This relates to the areas of natural constraint, ANC. Will it be the same ANC, will it be just a rollover or will there be change? It also relates to the basic payment scheme, BPS, the green, low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and so forth. The Minister might outline what will happen over the next few years, because farmers need to know so they can get on with their business.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2020-09-15T22:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_904">The provision of interim CAP measures for the transitional period between the current rural development programme and the post-2020 CAP strategic plan is closely related to progress on the transitional regulations, which will provide a range of options for member states to deploy over the period.</p>
            <p eId="para_905"> Since their publication in November 2019, the transitional regulations have been subject to extensive discussions between the European Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.  A common understanding was reached between the Council and Parliament on the text in June, including with regard to a transition period of two years' duration. The Commission position remains in favour of a one-year transition period. This issue will be finalised in tandem with the incorporation of the details of the 2021-27 EU budget into the transitional regulations once the budget has been agreed with the European Parliament, which is expected by the end of October.</p>
            <p eId="para_906"> In the meantime, I am currently considering the potential options available, as well as engaging with stakeholders for their views.  We will have to ensure that what we do in the transitional period is consistent with programme for Government commitments, as well as providing a solid foundation for the development of our CAP strategic plan for the period to 2027.  In addition, the very ambitious targets set out in the EU biodiversity strategy and the farm to fork strategy will have to be taken into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_907"> My ministerial colleagues and I intend to continue meetings with the farm bodies and stakeholders over the coming weeks to hear their views and, importantly, to get their input.  I am also conscious that we have limited time to make decisions and implement workable solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_908"> It is important that we can give certainty to farmers in the near future. Obviously, the budget and the Estimates campaign will be important in that regard. Working with my ministerial colleagues in government, I want to ensure that schemes can be replicated and income streams maintained for farmers, and in terms of framing the next CAP programme to ensure it contains schemes that continue to contribute substantially to incomes and to deliver on the various objectives from a sustainability point of view.</p>

            <p eId="para_909">When we had the rural environment protection schemes, REPS, 1, 2, 3 and 4 followed by the agri-environment options schemes, AEOS, 1, 2 and 3 and then GLAS, a farmer could pass seamlessly from one to another. This became a fundamental part of the income of many farmers. Suddenly, at the end of GLAS there is nothing. Will we get an interim environmental measure? Farmers cannot wait. They have to feed families and they have to live. Will there be an interim environmental measure while we are waiting for the 2022-27 programme? In every other CAP we were able to roll over schemes into new schemes. I do not know why it did not happen in the last CAP.</p>

            <p eId="para_910">This is something the Deputy has raised regularly in the past. I accept the importance of ensuring that the income stream from environmental schemes, which has been very important for farmers, continues. In addition, there are the environmental outcomes and contributions to biodiversity and we do not want to see a missed opportunity to ensure those outcomes continue. Certainly, it is my objective to ensure that we have a continuation into next year for those who are coming out of GLAS and that we do not have gaps as they emerge. I am looking at the options for how we do that and also at the programme for Government commitment to the introduction of a new scheme and how a pilot scheme would look.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">The basic objective is to ensure a continuation for those coming out of GLAS in order that they will continue to be in an environmental scheme and be in a position to receive the income generated by that.</p>

            <p eId="para_912">My understanding is that some people have come out of GLAS and been left high and dry. These people have depended on it for years. I know that GLAS was much smaller than previous schemes such as REPS, which was the biggest scheme, and REPS 4 in particular. Certain farmers have gone from €11,000 or €12,000 down to nothing. They are still adhering to the same very high environmental standards but their income stream is gone. People have to live and survive. Many of them are on high nature value land, but that land has relatively low productivity or its productivity is constrained by rules laid down by the Minister's Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_913">The Minister referred to an aspiration that the transition period will only be one year. However, almost nobody in Europe believes that there will only be one year of transition. It will potentially be much longer and run into several years so it is important that we get this transition period right. I ask the Minister to quickly identify the schemes that will be available during the transition period because farmers need to know whether or not criteria will be changed. It is also important that the Minister outlines whether he personally has plans for the convergence process during the transition period, because clarity is required. We are getting very close to the transition period so to talk about consultations at this stage without some form of assurance on the type of funding to which Deputy Ó Cuív referred would be very unfair on farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_914">I thank Deputies Ó Cuív and Carthy. I indicated that the Commission has a preference for a one-year transition but it is becoming increasingly clear that a two-year transition will be required. If it is to be two years, it is important that we give clarity on the schemes and that the funding is there to ensure the income streams they produce for farmers continue as well. That will be an objective of mine over the coming weeks. I have been engaging comprehensively with farmer representative organisations to take on board their views on this matter, and I will continue to do so. A decision will be made in advance of the transition regulations being notified. I will be seeking to bring clarity regarding the schemes and other issues such as convergence when we get to that stage of agreeing the transition regulations.</p>

            <p eId="para_917">The Joint Committee on Climate Action launched its final, cross-party report, entitled Climate Change: A Cross-Party Consensus for Action on 16 April 2019. Its implementation was a matter for the previous Government, which adopted some of the measures in its own climate action plan for 2019. This Government is proposing to revisit that plan and publish its own climate Bill this autumn. The joint committee's report acknowledged that it "was not in a position to examine afforestation in any level of adequate detail". It did, however, set out a number of recommendations for the forestry sector to be considered in the design of the new national forestry programme for the period 2021 to 2027.</p>
            <p eId="para_918"> The committee also recommended that the climate action council, which is currently known as the Climate Change Advisory Council, conduct a comprehensive review of national forestry in respect of climate change mitigation and adaptation and feed its findings into the new national forestry programme. It was in this context that the committee suggested that the Government should also commission an independent review and sustainability audit of Coillte's forest business and other activities in 2019, in conjunction with a review of the Forestry Act 1988 to ensure that policy is consistent with the objectives of environmental, social and economic sustainability in this sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_919"> As the Deputy knows, Coillte is a private limited company established under the Forestry Act 1988.  The Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a principal objective of the company is to carry out the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and in accordance with effectual silvicultural practices.  It is self-financing and does not receive funding from the Exchequer. As a State-owned enterprise, it is also subject to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies 2016. Coillte currently operates forestry, land management, panel products and renewable energy businesses. The company manages an estate of 440,000 ha, of which just under 400,000 ha are forested.</p>
            <p eId="para_920"> I am also preparing the way for the design of a new national forestry strategy and national forestry programme, which I look forward to starting very soon.</p>

            <p eId="para_921">I welcome the Minister of State. I am disappointed with her response because it is the same response to which I have been listening for four years, having heard previous responses from civil servants. The Joint Committee on Climate Action made a very specific recommendation based on very specific reasons. Since then, climate change and biodiversity emergencies have been declared. Coillte owns over 50% of the forested land in Ireland so there are serious consequences here. The committee recommended a review. The simple question is whether the Government intends to carry out the review - yes or no? If the answer is "Yes", when will it happen?</p>

            <p eId="para_922">My commitment is to develop a new forestry programme. In that process I would like to engage with stakeholders and politicians all across the board to design the programme. If part of that process involves looking at the remit of Coillte, I would certainly welcome that. I am looking forward to embarking on that programme. There is an ambitious forestry programme outlined in the programme for Government, which I think the Deputy would accept. Once we embark on it we will have a very robust forestry programme that will deal with all of those issues, including climate action, the environmental issues and embracing communities in its design. That is something I am committed to doing.</p>

            <p eId="para_923">I welcome the Minister of State's commitment, and that of the Government, but I think she is missing the urgency of this situation. We declared a climate emergency over a year ago. We have a biodiversity crisis and we have a serious problem with the way we proceeded with planting trees in Ireland, particularly Sitka spruce, although I am no expert. I know from sitting on the Committee of Public Accounts for five years the problems that emerged when the reports came before us. I am not laying blame; I am just asking that we learn and go forward. We do not have time for what the Minister of State is proposing. A specific recommendation was made to carry out an independent review and the Minister of State now tells me there is a new national forestry programme. I know that. It was on every Government agenda, including that of the previous Government. I am asking the Minister of State to recognise the problems that exist as a result of successive Governments following a policy of planting the wrong trees, particularly in view of the challenges we are facing.</p>

            <p eId="para_924">I fully acknowledge the difficulties and problems in the forestry sector. I also acknowledge that we have legacy problems from poor decisions made over the past number of decades. That is something this Government is acknowledging and is appreciative of, and it is something we want to fix and improve upon. That is why we achieved the ambitious forestry commitments in the programme for Government, which are more ambitious than those of any previous programme. We have been in government for the past two and a half months, if that, and we have already implemented some interesting and progressive moves within forestry in terms of woodland creation. We have looked at the climate issue. We are embracing that in how we deal with our forestry and I have given a commitment that I want to see it improved. I want to see a better forestry model for Ireland. It is certainly something I want to be part of and drive on and I would appreciate any inputs from people in this House and beyond.</p>
