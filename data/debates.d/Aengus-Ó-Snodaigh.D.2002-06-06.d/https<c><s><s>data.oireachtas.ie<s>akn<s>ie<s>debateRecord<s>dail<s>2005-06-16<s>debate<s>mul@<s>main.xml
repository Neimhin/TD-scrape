Under the Good Friday Agreement the Government has a commitment for progressive security normalisation. The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act clearly does not fit into that commitment. The Government continues to renew repressive legislation, which has no basis or sound argument.

          <p eId="para_29">I do not dispute the matter being before us today as that is provided for and prescribed in the legislation. However, the legislation requires that a report on the previous year's activities under this legislation be laid before the House 21 days before it is debated. The Oireachtas Library received this annual report on 15 June 2005 and today is 16 June. We will have no opportunity to discuss the report, which is supposed to be key to our decision as to whether to renew the legislation. Why are we to discuss the matter the day after it has been presented to the Oireachtas? I know the legislation is to be renewed by 30 June. However, the report should have been presented to the House long before now.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_41">
          <from>Mr. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_44">I object to this procedure. Mr. Justice Morris has published a serious report, the headline of which was that: "The combination of gross negligence at senior level, amounting to criminal negligence, and the lack of objectivity and corruption at levels lower than that, caused the scandalous situation to arise." Nothing could be graver than the report we have seen. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said that the Dáil is the authority that will hold the Garda accountable. However, we are proposing to have a debate on this most important report that will merely take the form of statements. We will have no opportunity to question the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or his predecessor, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue. The Dáil will not have an opportunity to adopt a resolution on foot of the Morris tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">We are told that next week the Government will guillotine the Garda Síochána Bill so that debate on it will be circumscribed and brought to an abrupt end. Clearly Mr. Justice Morris has criticised the way in which the Dáil has handled the issue and has asked us to look very carefully at the Garda Síochána Bill in the light of his report. The sort of debate proposed, which will merely comprise statements read into the record without conclusion or question followed by a guillotined Garda Síochána Bill next week, is not adequate for what is demanded of the Oireachtas on this occasion. The Minister will need to think again in respect of the arrangements for tomorrow's sitting and in respect of the proposal to guillotine the Garda Síochána Bill and push ahead with Garda reforms in the teeth of serious concerns on the Opposition benches.</p>

The Government ignored the first report of the Morris tribunal and now the more serious second report is apparently to be relegated to what is in parliamentary terms the graveyard slot on Friday in the restrictive format of statements only. This adds insult to the earlier injury.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">As Deputy Bruton said, the House has scarcely before received such an important report from the point of view of our democracy, society, confidence in the efficacy of policing etc. The response of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been to misrepresent it.

He now claims ownership of it and says——</p>

However, Mr. Justice Morris has said the opposite and suggested we should review the Garda Síochána Bill. He explained in Delphic terms why this is necessary in his view.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">It is entirely to diminish both Mr. Justice Morris and this House for the Government merely to allow statements in an abridged debate without the possibility of tabling a motion that commits the Government to implementing the recommendations in the report.

          <p eId="para_54">We need to revisit the excision of the terms of reference by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the then Attorney General, Deputy McDowell, when it was proposed to include the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Ministers for Justice and Attorneys General concerned.

          <p eId="para_57">While the Order Paper calls for statements on the Morris tribunal, I ask the Government to reconsider and take into account the gravity of the matter about which we are being asked to make statements. The Government should take into account the ten months during which the first report met with a wall of silence and the need to make up some ground for that insult to the work of the Morris tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">Will the Government to table a motion showing a determination not to allow again the injustice, incompetence and abuse of power highlighted by the Morris tribunal? It seems that the Government is not serious about addressing the recommendations of the tribunal. The only way to remedy that impression is for the Government to table a serious motion on which the House can vote. What is proposed is the parliamentary equivalent of chewing the cud or having a chat about a matter that is of such gravity for the wider public.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_51">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_59">Perhaps in his response to Members the Minister might indicate whether he has received a copy of the report of the Morris tribunal. Has any Member of the House received a copy of the report? We received a copy of the first report a fortnight after the initial publication. Now we are about to enter a flawed approach to its content as only statements on the report are allowed. Although it was set up to be accountable to this House, the Morris tribunal has not reported to it. The only way to access the report is through the Internet or by depending on our friends in the media. The reality is that it is not reported back to this House in a proper and meaningful way. The point needs to be emphasised that there is a responsibility on the Morris tribunal to recognise that it was this institution that established it in the first place and that the report should be sent to each Member that was a party to setting it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">The proposal to have statements only is an outrageous response to a serious issue. It is imperative that we have a full debate, a clear proposition and an outline of action to be taken. Everyone in this House, irrespective of political persuasion, expects actions to be taken on foot of the recommendations in the report of the Morris tribunal. The wider public expects the same. I urge that the proposal to have statements only be withdrawn, that a full debate be scheduled, that the Government outline its intent for action following the publication of the second report of the Morris tribunal and that we have the opportunity to debate that substantive proposition rather than this charade which amounts to absolutely nothing.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">Tomorrow's statements represent the beginning of the response to the Morris tribunal and the systemic problems that have been identified by the report. Tomorrow is not the beginning and the end of the story, but simply a series of formal statements that have been used before for such matters. Were nothing else to happen, then that would clearly be inadequate. However, the statements will give the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the opportunity to deal with some of the misrepresentations of our position propagated by the Opposition.</p>

I take this opportunity to inform the Minister that my party will not engage in any negotiations on these proposals with the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, much as I have regard for him, because they are designed to further disadvantage the Opposition in terms of the operation of this House and to diminish the stature of the House.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_358">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_359">That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998), shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30 June 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The resolution under consideration seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June. Were the House not to so resolve today, these sections would lapse.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">In commencing the debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputies will recall that the 1998 legislation was enacted after the Omagh bombing August 1998, which claimed the lives of 29 innocent persons and injured more than 200 others.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">That appalling act of barbarism continues to reverberate down through the years, and I am pleased to note that charges have recently been brought against a person in Northern Ireland as regards these murders. The investigation into this atrocity continues on both sides of the Border, and there continues to be excellent co-operation between the Garda authorities and the PSNI in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">In recognition of the exceptional circumstances surrounding the enactment of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that the legislation should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas. The purpose of the recurring Oireachtas scrutiny is to ascertain whether the circumstances then prevailing in 1998 justify the continuance in force of the legislation's provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Accordingly, by virtue of resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 15-16 June 2004, sections 2 to 12, inclusive, 14 and 17 of the 1998 Act will cease to operate on and from 30 June next. That is, of course, unless a further resolution is passed by each House authorising the sections to continue to operate for a period not exceeding 12 months. In addition, there is a requirement in the 1998 Act to lay a report on the operation of the Act before each House of the Oireachtas prior to any consideration by the Houses of the renewal of the provisions. Such a report was laid before this House last Monday by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The report was submitted in accordance with the statutory requirements and the 21-day period referred to in the relevant statute is the timeframe after which the report must be completed.</p>

However, in strict legislative terms, the statutory requirement is that the reporting period of the report ends not later than 21 days before the moving of the resolution. While the Deputy may have made the same point last year, at least this year the matter has been clarified for him to the effect that there is no strict legal obligation in that connection.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_372">The report was laid before this House last Monday by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The conclusion of the report is that the relevant sections of the 1998 Act should remain in force for a further 12 months. In the first instance, this is the firm view of the Garda Síochána, which considers the Act to be a vital piece of legislation in the continuing fight against terrorism and insists that it is of paramount importance that the relevant provisions remain in operation. The harsh reality is that, despite the democratically expressed wishes of the people north and south of the Border, those responsible for the Omagh bombing continue to pursue, plan and promote a campaign of violence. In this regard, it must be remembered that there have been a number of near misses involving the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA since Omagh, and it is only through dint of excellent police work by the Garda and the PSNI that further tragedy on a massive scale has been averted.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The new and more sinister forms of international terrorism, and particularly Islamist terrorism, have been brought home to Europe with the Madrid bombings of 11 March 2004, involving the murder of 200 innocent commuters. The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 was enacted last March to deal with this international terrorist threat by enabling the application of the Offences against the State Acts against international terrorist groups and individuals. Again, it is important that this legislation should be maintained in its efficacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">I want to turn to the individual sections of the 1998 Act that this House is being invited to continue in force for a further 12 months. First, dealing with those sections of the 1998 Act that were used since the end of the last reporting period, that is, from 1 June 2004 to 31 May 2005, the following is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Section 2 was used on 30 occasions. This section provides that where, in any proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any questions, then the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. However, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure. That is an evidential principle and it was relied upon on 30 occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Section 3 was used on one occasion. It provides that, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his behalf, unless the court permits otherwise. Section 4 was also used on one occasion. This section amends section 3 of the Offences against the State Act 1972 in such a way as to expand the definition of "conduct" that can be considered as evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation. Specifically, "conduct" can now include matters such as "movements, actions, activities, or associations on the part of the accused". This change simply aligns the definition of conduct in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Section 5 was used on 20 occasions. This section deals with the drawing of adverse inferences in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts, and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years' imprisonment or more. The effect of this section is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his defence that he could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. As with section 2, however, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Section 7 was used twice. This section makes it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Section 9 was used on 69 occasions. This section makes it an offence to withhold information which a person believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by another person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for such an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Section 10 was used on five occasions and extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act 1939, as amended, from 48 hours to 72 hours, but only on the express authorisation of a judge of the District Court. In this regard, the judge must be satisfied, on the application of a Garda officer not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make or have made submissions on his behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">In the reporting period in question an extension was applied for in five cases and all applications were granted. Charges resulted in four of these cases, with the fifth resulting in a file being sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Section 11 which was used on two occasions empowers a judge of the District Court to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he was previously detained under section 30 of the 1939 Act, as amended, but released without charge. This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised in circumstances in which the judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána about the person in question's suspected participation in the offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Section 14 was used on 99 occasions. The effect of this section is to make the new offences created under sections 6 to 9, inclusive, and 12 of the 1998 Act scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. This means that persons suspected of committing these offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I turn now to those sections of the 1998 Act which were not used in the period under report, namely, sections 6, 8, 12 and 17. Section 6 establishes the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act 1939. Section 8 makes it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences. Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 providing for the forfeiture of property. Essentially, the 1994 provision empowers a court, in its discretion, whenever any person is convicted of an offence, to order the forfeiture of any property in the possession of that person which was used or intended to be used to facilitate the commission of the offence. The effect of section 17 is, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order. The information on the use made of the provisions of the 1998 Act is based on data received from the Garda authorities and is contained in the report on the Act laid before this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I turn to the report of the Hederman committee which was established to review the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1998. The purpose of its inquiry was so that the Government would implement its obligation under the Good Friday Agreement to have a review of the offences against the State legislation and the Government has discharged its obligations in that respect. Of those sections of the 1998 Act on which specific recommendations were made, it should be noted that the Hederman committee unanimously recommended retention of sections 6, 7 and 12. Moreover, a majority recommended the retention of sections 2, 5 and 9, while the committee was evenly divided in its opinion as to whether section 10 should be retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">A majority recommended the repeal of section 8 of the 1998 Act. The committee unanimously recommended the repeal of section 3(1)(<i>b</i>)(<i>ii</i>) of the 1972 Act, as amended by section 4 of the 1998 Act, but the amendment in question was simply to the wording. The committee also made general recommendations relating to the scheduling of offences which would have implications for section 14 of the 1998 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Accordingly, of the 13 sections of the 1998 Act being considered for renewal by the House, the Hederman committee expressed a substantive opinion on eight of them. Of these eight, the committee recommended the retention of seven, either unanimously, by majority or, in one case, on an even split. Accordingly, although a full consideration of the entire set of recommendations of the Hederman committee remains ongoing, it is clear that little or no change to the provisions of the 1998 Act would, in any case, be warranted. The analysis of the provisions proofed by the Hederman committee found that no changes of substance were required.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">In any event, over the past year the House will be aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has been busily engaged in bringing forward an extensive programme of legislative reform. In the counter-terrorism area, efforts in the past year were focused on enacting the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, which occurred in March last. Now that the Act is out of the way, a fuller consideration of the entirety of the recommendations of the Hederman committee can proceed and the Minister intends to bring further proposals to Government in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The implementation of the Good Friday Agreement remains an ongoing challenge. Recent events in Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction point to the fact that paramilitary organisations are involved in activities of a criminal nature. One cannot ignore the simple fact that there are paramilitary organisations committed to the destruction of the Agreement and all other initiatives designed to bring lasting peace to the people of the island. As long as there are organisations dedicated to frustrating the will of the people through violence and mayhem, robust counter-measures must be available to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Although the efforts of paramilitary organisations to wreak death, destruction and destabilisation have often been thwarted, we cannot allow the proven successes of the two police services to lull us into a false sense of security about their intentions or capabilities. Given half a chance, both the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA would gladly bequeath to us any number of terrorist atrocities.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">While the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 is only one element of the State's ongoing response to this threat, to do away with it now would be to weaken, in an irresponsible manner, the State's bulwark against terror. I commend the resolution to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Mr. G. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_393">The insertion of a built in review clause in all emergency legislation is good legislative practice. Thankfully, in 1998 our legislators were wise enough to include such a clause in the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act. The clause reminds us, on an annual basis, that we are not yet living in a truly democratic society in which civil liberties, human rights and the rule of law are respected in accordance with international standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">We have introduced a plethora of emergency Bills over the years, all of which were intended at the time to be temporary. Unfortunately, the unwillingness of subversive organisations to recognise the democratic wishes of the overwhelming majority of people on this island has resulted in many laws intended to cater temporarily for an emergency becoming part and parcel of our corpus of legislation. Many emergency laws, including that covered by the resolution, are still necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">Most emergency provisions were originally introduced because of the murderous activities of the Provisional IRA over many years. The treacherous, treasonous members of this organisation still claim in their puny minds that the IRA is the real Government of the State. Despite the fact that the whole country, in a referendum, clearly and unequivocally sent it a message to disarm and go away, it persists in holding up the peace process and, like gangsters, holding the nation to ransom.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Although a ceasefire has been in place for seven years, the most recent report of the Independent Monitoring Commission states clearly that the IRA is still involved in criminal activity, controls terrorist-cum-criminal gangs and refuses to decommission its arms. Its political wing, Sinn Féin, continually blames everyone else for not fulfilling their commitments under the peace process, yet an organisation which should not have existed in a democratic society in the first place continues to refuse to disband and decommission its arms.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Before Christmas last year, it appeared Sinn Féin and the IRA had won the jackpot. Every conceivable concession was about to be made to them to try to achieve peace but, again, despite their significant successes at the negotiating table considering the tiny number of people in a largely democratic society who supported them at the ballot box, they could not resist continued involvement in all kinds of criminality, which once again pushed the peace process into crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">When this resolution was introduced in the House last year, Sinn Féin Members stated that the purpose of the offences against the State legislation is to dealing with an emergency, of which there was none at that time. I presume the House will hear more of the same today.</p>

          <from>Mr. G. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_400">There is an emergency. An active organisation, a so-called army whose objectives hit at the core of our democracy, which challenges our Constitution, breaks the laws legitimately enacted by a democratically elected Parliament and scornfully ignores the democratic will of the vast majority of people on this island, continues to operate in this State. In addition, dissident republican groups are prepared to bomb and kill innocent people to further their objectives. Against this background, we are told there is no emergency. This island has been in a state of emergency since the foundation of the State because a minority has refused to accept the will of the majority or democracy.</p>

        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_238">
          <from>Mr. G. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_402">The only reason people continue to support this repressive legislation, which undoubtedly infringes on our civil liberties and freedoms, is that the overwhelming majority want to uphold as much of their democracy and freedom as possible. They are prepared to sacrifice some of their rights and civil liberties so the State can use these laws to protect that democracy from those few who, with the bomb and the bullet, would take it away from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">It is not repressive governments or those in opposition who support this legislation imposing these unwelcome and regressive laws on Irish citizens. No democratic government or party that legitimately faces the electorate every five years could or would justify the continuation of these laws without the knowledge that the vast majority of the people support the underlying objective of protecting democracy and the lives and well-being of citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">These laws are dangerous and there are risks involved, such as abuse by the gardaí, the Government may not repeal them at the appropriate time or the laws will be used for purposes other than those intended. Recent events and debates in this House about the Morris tribunal, the Garda Síochána Bill and the Criminal Justice Bill must be measured against this repressive legislation which we are forced to maintain and, from time to time, to add to because of the continuing activity of the Provisional IRA, the Real IRA, the Continuity IRA and any other jumped up terrorist organisation that tries to usurp the authority of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The legislation we are dealing with today was introduced after the Omagh bombing that brutally took the lives of 29 innocent people and injured more than 200 others. It was a brutal and cowardly attack, a terrible atrocity that reverberated throughout the island and shocked people everywhere. We had become used to nightly news bulletins about bombings in Northern Ireland and England but Omagh seemed different, we seemed to be entering an even more brutal phase. One of the women killed was born less than four miles from my home town in north Cork. Her sister and her had married in Omagh and on that fateful day she and her daughter, who was pregnant with twins, were killed. Many of us travelled from Cork to the funeral in utter shock and dismay that this could happen to one of our own.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Recently at hearings of the sub-committee on the Barron report, we heard from victims and relatives of victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. The pain and distress these people still feel is unimaginable. We are still told, however, that there is no emergency and no need for emergency legislation. This is despite the fact that five members of the Real IRA were sentenced to jail on Tuesday. The leader of the Real IRA in Munster was jailed for five years, his second-in-command for four years and three other members of an active service unit were given sentences of three and four years. One of these men is a former IRA man who was released from a ten-year jail sentence under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, another was the officer commanding the Real IRA in Munster and another was in charge of operational matters in Cork and Limerick. The other two were part of an active service unit in Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The one regret we should have at this stage is that this legislation has not worked more effectively. The Garda report on the legislation shows, however, that most sections that we are renewing had some effect in the last year. A total of 376 people were arrested and 61 convicted in court, with 102 people still awaiting trial. Considering the murder and mayhem caused by a small active service unit in Omagh, by any measure, these provisions will prevent more atrocities.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">As a democratic society we still have a long way to go. Human rights and civil liberties are a fundamental building block in any real democracy. For years subversive organisations have prevented the establishment of a truly just society where the laws of the land comply with international standards and are implemented in a totally fair and transparent manner. This can only happen when citizens no longer fear that the authority of their elected Parliament and Constitution is no longer threatened by terrorist organisations portraying themselves as republicans. Fine Gael, in these circumstances, supports the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_239">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_409">I listened to my constituency colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, this morning say that this legislation is unnecessary and I would agree with him only if the problem went away, but unfortunately it has not gone away.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I welcome the fact that we discuss this matter on a yearly basis. We introduced emergency agriculture legislation during the foot and mouth crisis and were given an absolute assurance that it would be discussed after 12 months, but we still have not had an opportunity to debate it in the House. At least this legislation is discussed on an annual basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I represent a constituency that has more to gain or lose from the peace process than any other in this country. County Monaghan has the longest border with Northern Ireland and we all want to see my area treated the same as any other part of the country as far as job creation and a normal society are concerned. Thankfully, since the ceasefire that has largely been the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Going back to the Omagh bombing, however, those of us who attended the funerals and deal with the families on an ongoing basis are aware of the trauma they are going through. I am glad at least one person is being investigated for that tragic affair. Many other people, however, know who took part in it. It concerns me that people at the highest level know who took part in the bombing but only one person is behind bars.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The recent murder of Robert McCartney raises many questions, as do the criminal and paramilitary activities we have seen around the country. As Deputy Gerard Murphy said, many people out there are still active and, thank God, some of them are being put behind bars, as is only right.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I welcome the opportunity to discuss this legislation but I wish it did not have to be there. Under the Good Friday Agreement that we all supported, some issues were contentious. To me, one of the most contentious issues was that all prisoners, from both sides, would be released within two years — it happened within a number of months. The other contentious issue was decommissioning. That has been made a mockery of and while some small effort was made to deal with it, the reality is that it has not happened. It is important those areas are dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The decommissioning of mindsets is even more important. Coming up to an election, we heard the leader of Sinn Féin calling on the IRA to consider giving up arms. After 8 December we all understood that was part of the agreement but we are now told it will hopefully be decided before the end of the summer. This issue was part and parcel of the Good Friday Agreement. If we want peace to last, we must see real progress in this area. I know it is not easy. I know it is hard to change people who have adopted a mindset for years and believe theirs is the correct way. I did not realise how serious this was until I visited some European countries that recorded what happened in the two world wars. I saw at first hand what human beings did to each other. I saw how they can build railroads and furnaces to kill their fellow human beings. When one sees this, it helps one to understand the mindset with regard to this whole matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">There is so much to be gained from a full peace process. Recently I visited Clones Town Council with Oireachtas colleagues where one of the main issues for discussion was the Ulster Canal, a true cross-Border project that unites everyone from both sides of the Border. They want the project to go ahead, yet, as part and parcel of the Good Friday Agreement, this matter must be dealt with under the Northern Ireland Assembly and the cross-Border bodies. As a result of the suspension, the matter cannot be resolved. I have asked the relevant Minister to see if there is a way around this but to no avail. It is proof of what is being held back because of the lack of finality from the Provisional IRA, the Real IRA and the loyalist organisations. I make no apologies for naming them in the House. We cannot have one without the other. We must have complete decommissioning if this is to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The last British general election threw up many problems for us. It has forced the electorate into two extreme camps. Unfortunately, the middle ground of those who led the way and fully supported the Good Friday Agreement, has lost out. We are now in a new situation. Time is limited and it is not good to see people going to the extremes. The only way it can be sorted is that those with authority use it to end the violence, the criminality and disband the IRA, the UVF and all the different groups that have led this country into trouble.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_418">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the motion on the renewal of the sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998. We all remember the tragic circumstances under which this amending legislation was introduced in September 1998. We will recall how ironic it was that we had signed up to the Good Friday Agreement in Easter of the same year only for it to be shattered by the worst single atrocity of the 30 years of the Troubles. No one expected the shocking and horrific event at Omagh. In that context, there was unanimity when this legislation was presented to strengthen the powers of the Garda to deal with the perpetrators of the atrocity. It was an amendment to the Offences against the State Act. People believed that if there was anything necessary to bring those perpetrators to justice, every citizen would gladly provide the mechanism and support for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">There were concerns about emergency legislation becoming permanent, a feature of such legislation in the past. It was for that reason the Houses agreed an annual review mechanism would be built into the legislation. It was hoped that once the perpetrators were brought to justice, this legislation would no longer be on the Statute Book. Last year, only one person was convicted of a related offence to the Omagh bombing, the first conviction since the legislation was passed in 1998. The Minister of State did not refer to it in his speech. I would like to know if anyone else has been put behind bars under the terms of the legislation since this time last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">We want a full report on the operation of the legislation. On today's Order of Business, I raised the issue of whether Members are entitled to an earlier production of the report on the previous year's implementation of the legislation. I believe we are. As the Minister of State alluded, I raised this last year when it was impossible to get a copy of the report the night before the debate on the legislation. If I had not gone searching yesterday for the report I would not have it. I must make a correction to what I said on this morning's Order of Business. I misconstrued the date 15 June for 13 June. It was in the Library on 13 June. However, it took quite some time for the Library to find it for me.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Section 18 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_422">Each of the following sections, namely sections 2 to 12 and 14 and 17 shall, subject to subsection (2), cease to be in operation on and from the 30th day of June, 2000, unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that that section should continue in operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The House will sit past 30 June and on 1 July. There is ample time over the next several weeks to give us an opportunity to digest the report. There is no reason we should rush this motion in the same week the legislation has been reported on. Section 18(3) states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_424">Before a resolution under this section in relation to a section specified in subsection (1) is passed by either House of the Oireachtas, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform shall prepare a report, and shall cause a copy of it to be laid before that House, of the operation of the section during the period beginning on the passing of this Act or, as may be appropriate, the date of the latest previous report under this subsection in relation to that section [typical legalese] and ending not later than 21 days before the date of the moving of the resolution in that House.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The Minister must prepare a report, then lay it before the House not later than 21 days before moving the resolution. The Minister of State is arguing on a technicality that once the report is prepared 21 days before its renewal, the functions have been fulfilled. It is clear from the legislation that the report must be prepared and laid before the House not later than 21 days before moving the resolution. This has not been adhered to either in the spirit or the technicality of the law. We built in this annual review mechanism for the purpose of scrutinising the operation of the legislation and to see whether it deserved be renewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">That spirit of the law will be lost if Members receive the report and have the debate in the same week. Last year, we received the report the day before the debate at the very earliest. Unless the spirit of the legislation is upheld by providing the report for Members much earlier before the debate is held, it is impossible to scrutinise, conduct proper research and prepare for it. Once again, I ask the Minister to provide at least two weeks between the time in which the report is placed in the Library and the debate. That is the least we can expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The legislation came about because of the tragic events in Omagh in 1998. The amendments to the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1972 include changes regarding the rules of evidence, membership of an unlawful organisation, other offences under the Offences against the State Act and scheduled offences. Some new substantive offences have also been included as well as the extension of the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the 1939 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">This is part of a schedule of emergency legislation tied up with special courts which has been in existence since 1939. Interestingly, one of the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement was to examine all emergency legislation to see if it could be stood down. The intention was that, given the ceasefire and the Good Friday Agreement, the legislation would be reviewed on both sides of the Border. Such a review of the terrorist legislation took place in Northern Ireland, where the Diplock courts and the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act relating to Northern Ireland were stood down. The legislation there has been effectively normalised and regularised.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">One should remember that the Omagh attack took place in Northern Ireland. That horrific act was not perpetrated in this jurisdiction but in Northern Ireland, and the British Government did not see fit to reintroduce a series of emergency powers to deal with the situation, nor has it done since. It has accepted the provisions and thrust of the Good Friday Agreement to dismantle, in so far as possible, those emergency provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">We have done nothing of the sort. Our discussion should be broadened to examine how the emergency legislation came into existence. In 1939, the Emergency was declared and the rainbow Government lifted it in 1995. Despite that, the offences against the State legislation from 1939 still remains in existence. It was retained because of the supposed dangers of jury intimidation or jury bias. In my experience, we do not have a problem with jury intimidation but with witness intimidation and it does not pertain to special legislation or political offences alone. It also applies to normal criminal offences. That is why we must examine the paraphernalia of legislation which will determine our criminal justice system. Members must examine whether the arguments for the introduction of the original Offences Against the State Act and for Dessie O'Malley's establishment of the Special Criminal Courts in 1972 still hold good. Even in 1972, Mr. O'Malley stated that he envisaged that the Special Criminal Courts would be temporary. There was no acceptance that they would continue on a long-term basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Not only has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform accepted the Special Criminal Court, but this year he took a further step by introducing a second Special Criminal Court. He introduced it in the context of the terrorist legislation which was initially introduced in 2002 and was passed in 2005 as the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act. I am still unsure what was his real justification. I asked him whether there was a backlog of cases to be dealt with, but he was unable to clarify that. He introduced a second Special Criminal Court for no apparent reason that he could justify. Perhaps he expected an outbreak of paramilitary activity on the part of the Continuity IRA or the Real IRA which would have to be dealt with. Is this second Special Criminal Court operational? What has been done about it? Was it established to deal with a backlog of cases that were not dealt with in a timely manner and are sitting there?</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_433">If that is the case, will the Minister give the House an indication of the breakdown between scheduled and non-scheduled offences before the Special Criminal Court? My information is that the Special Criminal Court has moved from its proper jurisdiction, away from scheduled political-type offences, towards normal, criminal offences that should normally be heard before jury courts. However, it is easier to use the Special Criminal Court, and because the Director of Public Prosecutions has sole discretion to refer non-scheduled offences to it, he takes the easy option. As Members are aware, the DPP is not obliged to explain his actions. It is strange.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I do not have time to make all my intended points. Almost seven years have passed since this legislation was introduced. Last year, the Minister indicated — I notice there is a reference to this point in the legislation this year — that once the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 had been passed, he would be in a position to consider the legislation pertaining to the special courts. He intended to bring proposals before the Government last year. Will a proper review of the legislation take place as proposed under the Good Friday Agreement? Will proposals be brought to the Government now that the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act is in place to deal with international terrorism? Next time around, can Members expect a different motion from the Government on this issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_436">In many respects, this is as close as it gets to the dusty days of mid-summer in this Chamber. I am worried that a mere half dozen Deputies are present when, in effect, Members are nodding through such legislation for the sixth time in as many years.

          <p eId="para_440">I understand that but the Government has discretion in regard to ordering Dáil business. I would have thought business as weighty as this should not simply go through without the Minister being present.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">As Deputy Costello pointed out, there are real concerns, including concerns that perhaps the remit of the Special Criminal Court is being extended — certainly the types of cases it is taking are extending into a much wider realm. There is a deep-seated concern, to which Deputy Costello also alluded, that we have brought in very powerful legislation in other areas. I point to the legislation on the retention of data introduced by the Minister last year, which I opposed. It is all powerful and has been used to great effect in several high profile cases. The type of legislation in place is very powerful, so why do we need both the belt and braces in this regard? Why do we need to simultaneously strengthen the terrorism legislation on the Statute Book and keep the Special Criminal Court?</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I do not believe the case has been well made by the Minister of State or by the Minister for this plethora of legislation and regulation on the Statute Book seven years after the Omagh bombing. While I readily concede the Omagh bombing was an atrocity, there are far more pressing matters on which to bring in stronger legislation, whether to tackle the problem of the hundreds of people killed on our roads each year or other areas. I do not see the need to keep such strong powers in the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at this time, particularly when there are deep concerns about the conduct of gardaí in recent years not only as a result the Morris tribunal but also as a result of the false arrest of individuals going about their business and the violence of the gardaí at the May Day protest a couple of years ago. I am not convinced at this time, when confidence in the gardaí is at a relatively low ebb, that we should continue to give them enhanced powers. I oppose the proposal to renew the legislation at this point. Seven years have passed and it is time to move forward by dropping this draconian legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_443">Every year Deputies have the opportunity to vote on whether to continue to use repressive legislation in this State. That opportunity presents again despite the past decade of the peace process, the IRA ceasefire and the Good Friday Agreement. Every year the Minister publishes a slim report at the last minute, which no one has a chance to read, as has been stated here. Despite this, every year this House rubber-stamps the continuing operation of these laws, which suspend not only the ordinary rules of evidence but fundamental rights, including the right to silence.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Every year my colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh or I argue the Government's obligations regarding progressive security normalisation under the Good Friday Agreement. Every year we ask what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is planning to do with the Hederman recommendations on which he has been sitting since 2002. Every year only a few join the Sinn Féin Deputies in speaking out against this coercion of democracy and human rights, and I commend all those who do.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Those in what I view as the political establishment are still locked in denial about the fact that more than 60 years of emergency law has only helped perpetuate the conflict on and between these islands. It is a contributory factor. Equally, seven years of the 1998 amendment Act powers have not stopped dissident republicans. The only thing that can have this effect — I ask the Minister of State to note it — is to make democracy really and truly work. This means making the peace process work, demonstrating that the Good Friday Agreement is not dead, as the DUP leader claims, and proving that profound political and social change can be achieved by other means. That is the commitment we have made and the challenge Sinn Féin has embraced.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Every year when this law is renewed, those Deputies who support it take it on faith that the Garda will not abuse the powers it confers. They take it on faith that no garda will fabricate the evidence used to convict in the Special Criminal Court. I put it to Deputies that the findings of the Morris tribunal to date must force them to re-examine that blind faith on this occasion. This Government is asking Deputies, even in the wake of the Morris tribunal reports, to renew legislation that will continue to allow people to be convicted on the word of a garda. As supporters of this motion, they must ask themselves, what if they are complicit in perpetuating miscarriages of justice by the suspension of the ordinary rules of evidence in order to secure convictions, especially when there continues to be no effective oversight of the Garda and knowing this situation will continue even after the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's fundamentally flawed Garda legislation passes. I put it to Deputies and the Minister of State that the renewal of this Offences Against the State Act is not at all in the interests of democracy and justice.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_249">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_447">History will judge this House harshly for failing to assert that the key to security is human rights and not human rights abuses. Year in, year out Deputies vote for the renewal of this legislation which is the envy of repressive regimes around the world. Only a few people in this House have the moral courage to speak out against it and fewer still have the guts to back that up when there is a vote. Surely the Morris tribunal report, which will be briefly discussed tomorrow, and particularly the revelations in the first report, the McGlinchey module, must give them pause for thought that people can be convicted in the Special Criminal Court under special laws on the word of the Garda special branch man.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">History will judge harshly all those Deputies with their heads in the sand about the abuses perpetrated by the State against citizens on their watch. They are so consumed and blinded by anti-republicans, they are failing in their duty to protect the public interest. It is incumbent on them to consider their responsibility carefully and to consider what we now know. We know the gardaí fabricated evidence of arms finds in Donegal, that the Murphy conviction in the Omagh case was overturned because of Garda fabrication, that the gardaí planted a gun on James Sheehan in north Kerry and that the father of four, Niall Binead, had no presumption of innocence as he was tried by the media and convicted of membership of an illegal organisation on the basis of exercising his right to silence. Despite media misrepresentation, he was not convicted of spying allegations. He was not convicted of unlawful collection of information under section 8. In fact, according to the Minister, no one has been charged under section 8. Does this not raise questions for Deputies about the conviction? Earlier this week, five Limerick men faced up to five years in prison on the word of a senior garda. Most of the evidence against them seems to be that they laid a wreath.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Can Deputies be confident that the powers they are about to reconfirm have not been abused in nearly 700 arrests in the past year alone? Are they absolutely certain about the soundness of each of the 60 plus convictions? Do they firmly believe all the 102 awaiting trial will receive a fair one? If not, I ask them to vote against this motion.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_450">I am glad of the opportunity to discuss this very important motion and to put on record that I will strongly oppose it. It is a sad day for democracy, human rights and wider society that at this historic and important time when we are making an effort to come to the end of a long conflict on the island and conflict resolution is in process there are people who want to introduce draconian legislation. That is illogical and does not make sense. It is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">For any citizen and democrat, repressive legislation is not the way forward. If we are serious about protecting human and civil rights and if we are lecturing other nations on this issue, everybody should stand up and be counted and vote against this motion and this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">We have read in recent days the scandal of the Morris tribunal, corruption among senior gardaí, bad leadership, disastrous management and blatant scandal within the force. This is not acceptable. Yet the Government proposes to introduce more repressive legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">It might not be trendy or fashionable to do this and I accept there is a strong law and order element in this House, but I challenge the Government on this issue. It should always be vigilant in regard to civil liberties and human rights. There have been miscarriage of justice cases in the past because of repressive legislation. There were the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four cases. In America there is the Miami Five case where five Cubans are in jail because they tried to stop violence being perpetrated against their country. I urge caution in introducing legislation such as this that will damage the integrity of our justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">There have also been many other cases such as the McBrearty case. I have also dealt with the Danny Doherty case and recently in my constituency the Peter Preston case. These issues are all very relevant to this debate. A number of Deputies referred to the case of James Sheehan from West Commons, Ardfert and the incident that happened on 17 August 1989. There are serious questions to be asked about the incident where it is alleged that a gun had been found in Mr. Sheehan's car and he was arrested under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act 1939. I understand this file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions but subsequently no prosecution ensued. There is also a major debate about the question of the missing gun. What happened to it and why and when was it destroyed? It would be fairly obvious to any objective person who read about this case that it is a disgrace that this person was set up in this way and that people got away with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">It is also a disgrace that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform hides his head in the sand when it comes to dealing with these issues. It is all very well to go to parliamentary party meetings and have a major row about café bars but why is he not dealing with the serious issues of miscarriages of justice, injustice in our justice system and corruption among members of senior management of the Garda? These issues must be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I challenge the Minister of State and the Government in this regard. If Members are serious about democracy, human rights and ensuring respect for the State and its citizens, they must come out strongly against the Offences against the State Act as there have been incidents where this legislation has been damning.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">History has proved that repressive legislation does not work. Despite many who are cynical about this issue, it does not work. It makes the position worse. If we are serious about ending conflict and political violence, the way forward is political dialogue and inclusive negotiations. We should get on with that. That strengthens democracy. When we start using the law to back up a State and sections of it, it is repressive law and it does not work. Surely we have learnt from the history of what happened in the Six Counties over the past 30 years. Surely we have learnt from incidents of human rights abuses in Britain to which I referred. Members should be cautious of political parties and the political establishment supporting this legislation. I urge Members to reject it.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_458">I thank the various Members who contributed to this debate. In an ideal world we would not need offences against the State legislation but the experience of this State since 1937 has been that we need such legislation. Far from being a historical failure, it was a historical success in preserving our neutrality from 1939 to 1945 when some organisations were determined to ally themselves with the Axis powers and undermine it. It was a success in the 1950s when an ill-judged Border campaign was conducted. It also assisted this State throughout the terrible atrocities that took place in Northern Ireland from 1969 onwards. Therefore, to suggest the legislation is a historical failure is a mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">What we are discussing is the extension of legislation which was enacted by this House in 1998 on foot of the Omagh bombing. It is important to keep that perspective in mind in regard to the motion. Were we not to agree this motion today, as advocated by some Deputies, in any court proceedings that take place in the years ahead where an adjudication is to take place on persons complicity or involvement in the Omagh bombing, the legislation expressly providing for that could not be used against them. That is the practical reality facing us in this House today. Were we not to enact this resolution, we would be saying that the various inferences which the courts can draw in regard to suspects brought or persons charged before them in relation to that particular matter could not be drawn by them. In other words, we would be saying that the considered view of the Oireachtas in 1998 as to how persons should be brought to justice in regard to this episode should no longer apply to individual perpetrators of those terrible offences. I do not believe that as a proposition is stateable. Naturally, the debate has ranged far and wide over wider topics. That I understand and I will deal with many of the questions raised, but on that simple ground alone we must extend this resolution.</p>

There is a body of legislation going back to 1939 and the then Government committed itself at the time of the Good Friday Agreement to a review of that legislation and Mr. Justice Hederman carried out that review. The Government has kept its obligations and kept faith with the Good Friday Agreement in that respect.</p>

          <p eId="para_489">Deputy Ó Caoláin raised concerns about legislation of this character and referred to the more than 60 years of emergency law which he maintained perpetuates the conflict. The legislation has been in force since 1939 as part of the ordinary legislation of the State. It is there to protect the State and the existence of the State against those who deny its legitimacy. That is something that any independent Irish State is entitled to do. Of course, we can look at the details of it — that is what the Hederman report has done — and proposals can be brought forward. I dispute the suggestion made by Deputy Ó Caoláin and Deputy Ó Snodaigh that it requires an act of faith to enact this resolution. The Oireachtas made a considered determination in 1998 on what was required. This resolution is purely for the purposes of extending that for a further year.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">It is not necessary either to suggest that this legislation is motivated by anti-republicanism. This State is a Republic and has been valued as such since 1937 in the dictionary sense and since 1948 in a statutory sense. We do not need that kind of comment on this legislation. We are going back over old wounds and I appreciate that, but the important point is that in any jurisdiction nobody sees this type of legislation as ideal and in an ideal world there would not be a need for it. As long as there are groups and individuals who are bent on usurping the democratic institutions of this jurisdiction the State and its institutions must have the means at its disposal to protect itself. Of course we would all like to see unlawful organisations wither away and then, please God, this legislation would wither away with them. As I said in my opening remarks, we are confronted also by international terrorism. Europe learned a hard lesson on 11 March 2004 when 200 innocent commuters going about their daily business were murdered and many hundreds injured. The 2005 legislation deals with that international terrorist threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The ongoing threats from the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA are outlined in the Independent Monitoring Commission's reports and Members can see what is proposed. In regard to the Good Friday Agreement, following the elections in Northern Ireland and Britain renewed efforts are being made to overcome the well-known obstacles to progress. Both Governments are anxious to make headway with the ultimate goal of promoting full implementation of the Agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_584">I move amendment No. 1:<entity refersTo="#bill.2005.6.dail.4.amd_1" name="amendment"/>
                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_585">In page 3, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_586">"2.—Section 5(1) of the Electoral Act 1997 is amended by the deletion of ‘Census Report setting out the population of the State classified by area' and the substitution therefor of ‘Preliminary Report containing provisional information on the population of the State including classification by Electoral Area'.".</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I thank the Minister for agreeing to recommit the Bill in respect of the amendment. I discussed my concerns regarding the section with him privately and my anxiety that the matter be considered in the House. The issue that arises has been the subject of articles by Shane Coleman in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> in which he drew attention to the likely outcome of the 2006 census and the consequences it may have for the legislation we are discussing.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The revision of the constituencies recommended by the commission, which the Bill addresses, arises from the 2002 census, which had been delayed as a result of the foot and mouth scare in 2001. However, the Central Statistics Office estimates that the 2006 census will produce a population for the State of approximately 4.15 million as opposed to the 2002 census total of 3.9 million people. If the 2006 census results in a population of 4.15 million and assuming that the number of Members of the House remains at 166, the average population per Member will then be approximately 25,000. Having constituencies based on the boundaries in the Bill will mean very wide differences in the representation from constituency to constituency. For example, the respective populations of Cavan-Monaghan, a five-seat constituency under the Bill, and Louth, a four-seat constituency, will be roughly the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The article by Shane Coleman states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_590">Late last year, political analyst and research expert Odran Flynn analysed the 43 constituencies, and based on available population data, trends and proposed new developments, he estimated the likely population growth in the constituencies by the next census. His analysis suggests that after 2006, a staggering 21 of the constituencies will have a TD/population ratio more than 5% outside the national average. Ten of those will be more than 8% outside the average... Flynn predicts that Dublin West and Kildare North will be under-represented by a whopping 12% by 2006. Other counties under-represented include Dublin Central (by 10%), Dublin North (10%), Dublin Mid-West (9%) and Meath West (7%).</p>
          <p eId="para_591">He continues to list a number of constituencies which he claims would be over-represented if the 2006 census results in the population we expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Before the House is a Bill to revise the constituencies. If the next general election is held before the 2006 census results are known, we will have no issue — the Bill will remain intact and will be in line with the available census information known at the time the legislation was passed, in which case presumably it would not be vulnerable to legal challenge. However, if the next general election is held after the 2006 census figures are known and it transpires that there are variances in constituency representation in the order I have described, I believe it is highly likely that somebody will challenge the constitutionality of the legislation. We know the Constitution requires that the population ratio must be between 20,000 and 30,000 per Member of the House. However, from cases taken to the courts previously, we also know that the courts expect the ratio to remain close to the national average. If there are very wide divergences from the national average it is likely that somebody will challenge. I do not believe anybody in this House could predict what the courts would decide on the constitutionality of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The issue that will arise will centre on how the courts view the provisional census data, which are usually issued approximately three months after the census is completed. This would mean that the provisional census data would be available in July 2006. From the last census the provisional figure, which was published in July 2002, was 3,917,336. The final report showed a population of 3,917,203, which represented a difference across the entire country of only 133 people. This means that on the last occasion the provisional figures published were 99.997% accurate. The argument that has been made that the courts will not accept the provisional figures may not hold as we know the provisional figures are pretty close to the mark. If provisional figures are published in July 2006, people in County Louth, for example, may claim that they are under-represented in comparison with the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. All that needs to happen is for someone to go to court and claim that the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2005 is unconstitutional. We could find ourselves in a position where the courts are making a decision on the constitutionality of the constituency boundaries very close to the deadline of a general election — the Kelly judgment was handed down on the day before the previous general election — and that could have had dramatic consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">This is a serious issue which needs to be addressed. The constitutionality of the Bill is sound in respect of the 2002 census. Whether it will stand a test based on the 2006 census figures is very much in doubt. The courts will have to decide whether to rely on the provisional figures or the official figures. The estimate is that there will be a population increase of 250,000 in the four years to 2006. Due to development in the wider commuter belt around Dublin in recent years, it will have a huge impact on the proportion of the population to Members of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">I propose the amendment to address this issue. I do not think anybody — Members of the House, prospective candidates, political parties or the public — wants a situation where the next general election is engulfed by court cases on constituency boundaries. Who knows what decisions the court will make?</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_596">I welcome the discussion on this amendment which deals with proportionality and fair representation in the House. It will not be a problem in the future for the Minister because the next census will be taken when we are in Government. It is a serious matter. Whatever benchmark is used for the provision of statistics, I presume that when the Act is due for change the same formula would apply. It would be significant if that formula were changed. I would like to think that the ship sails for the next general election based on the present boundaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Deputy Gilmore's amendment referred to classification by electoral area and he spoke about the east of the country. I represent Drogheda in County Louth, yet there is very significant growth in the parts of Drogheda that are now in County Meath. There are 4,000 to 5,000 people in Drogheda who are now in County Meath. Estates like Rosevale in Drogheda are split in half. In another estate, house No. 21 is in my constituency and house No. 22 is in County Meath. The relationship between electoral boundaries——</p>

          <from>Mr. Roche</from>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_285">
          <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_599">I do not know. They voted for Deputy McEntee, so I had to let them do that. Electoral boundaries for local elections are not necessarily the same boundaries for national elections. There is a growing population in the borough council area of Drogheda which gets all services from that local authority, yet votes in the constituency of County Meath. That does not give it fair representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">I do not have a problem in principle with Deputy Gilmore's amendment. The issue is whether there is any undue delay by the Government in this instance in comparison with the decisions of other Governments on boundary changes. If the Government is doing something unreasonable, it should be struck down by a court, but if it is not, then we must accept that. However, I understand the basic point. Louth has basically the same population as Cavan and Monaghan, yet it has one less Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">I welcome this debate and we should perhaps widen it later to deal with the fact that constituency boundaries can sometimes be breached by local authority boundaries. The local authority boundaries in a fast growing population ought to be included in the environs of the town to which the population belongs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_286">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_602">In rising to support this amendment, I also acknowledge the willingness of the Minister to allow it to be discussed. I hope that he accepts the amendment because Deputy Gilmore made a clear and well researched point on the difference between the census report and the preliminary report. The census report usually extrapolates other information besides the population. The initial preliminary report deals primarily with the actual population and is arrived at very quickly. If we in this House are to present a fair case to every constituency, then we should seek to arrive at the information available at the earliest possible opportunity. In this case that would be the preliminary report. The margin of error in that report, as was pointed out earlier, is around 130 people, which is minuscule. However, the consequences of not dealing with it could disenfranchise a constituency of appropriate representation for a period of a full five years. That would be unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">I hope the Minister accepts this amendment to attach the provisional census report, which is only one step behind the actual census report and is accurate. I do not anticipate that I will go to the High Court to extend the boundary in County Louth, but Deputy Gilmore is absolutely correct. We border on requiring a five-seat constituency to achieve adequate representation. As a four-seat constituency, Louth is the most under-represented statistically in the State. I do not make the case simply because I am one of the four Deputies from Louth, but would make the point if it were true of any constituency. I make the point to demonstrate the divergence to which Deputy Gilmore has already alluded. I support the amendment and hope the Minister is in a position to accept it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_287">
          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_604">I support the amendment. As Kildare North is one of the few constituencies to which a seat will be added, Members may question why I support Deputy Gilmore's proposal. Deputy O'Dowd gave the reason when he said what we sought was fair representation. Not only is it possible that someone will go to court to prove representation is not fair, the preliminary figures may well prove both Kildare South and Kildare North to be in breach of the minimum level of representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">A subject at which I was always reasonably good in school was mathematics and I have added up the population figures for those moving from Kildare South to Kildare North and the number of house starts multiplied by three, which is the accepted figure, from 2002 on. The figure I have calculated is very close to 30,000, which is worse than the figure adjudicated on in the constituency revision. The population of Kildare has consistently grown over the years. On one occasion, the number of seats in the then Kildare constituency increased from three to five. The number of seats in the county has changed after almost every census of population in the recent past.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">There is an element of underprovision in the terms of reference for constituency changes in the failure to use a population minimum of 20,000 as the benchmark rather than an approximate average. If a 20,000 minimum were used, it would avoid crises and potential court challenges. It is not difficult to do the maths in this instance and arrive at a figure of approximately 30,000 in both Kildare South and Kildare North. Not only is there the potential for a court challenge, there is also a breach of constitutional provisions. In the circumstances, a court challenge is almost certain to succeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">There is a need to establish four seats in both Kildare constituencies without the transfer of additional population from Kildare South to Kildare North. People in the rural part of Kildare North never really know who is representing them, which is not especially positive. They are in one constituency at one election and in another at the next. One can almost certainly predict they will be transferred back to Kildare South at the next general election given the way the numbers are stacking up. It will be very difficult to ignore the figures if they are published in July 2006, at which time Kildare will be the county on which to focus for breaching the 30,000 threshold. On those grounds, I commend the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_288">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_608">It is because I consider the issue to be important that I was prepared to allow the Bill to be recommitted in respect of the amendment. I welcome the discussion. I picked up on the phrases "pretty close" and "near enough" which were used in the debate to describe the difference between the preliminary report on the census and the final report in volume 1. To be pretty close or near enough is not sufficient in law.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The issue Deputy Gilmore raised relates not to general averages but to the specific timing of the census volume. The moving of the amendment by the Deputy gives me the opportunity to record that following every census, the Central Statistics Office publishes its results on a phased basis, which we all accept. The office publishes an initial report which it says is preliminary, provisional and without statutory force, which are three important considerations in the context of any potential challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Deputy Gilmore was correct to state a challenge could take place one way or the other. It is important to take the opportunity to state the legal position to the House. Deputy Morgan made the point that, taking the overall scenario in the country, the difference between the head count and the final figure was 130, which is a minuscule figure. That minuscule figure, however, does not take into account variations from area to area and, for example, within district electoral divisions which one would expect to even out over the period. The figure of 130 nationally is an arithmetic figure which does not reflect the detail required to discuss the issue in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Volume 1 of the CSO publication on population classified by area in the April 2002 census was published in July 2003. Section 5(1) of the Electoral Act 1997 requires the Minister for the Environment to establish a constituency commission on publication of the census report setting out the population of the State classified by area, which is by volume 1. One does not get the required level of detail until one gets to volume 1, which is why that volume is used. While the CSO publishes a preliminary report, it does so with a number of health warnings attached to the effect that it is provisional and without statutory force.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">I read with special interest the articles to which Deputy Gilmore made reference as I anticipated the issue under discussion would arise. The author failed to take into account, especially in the first article, the fundamental difference on detail and area which is the basis for the use of volume 1. It is the reason the more precise volume has always been used and explains why it would be dangerous to move to a different system. There is language in High and Supreme Court judgments which supports the use of volume 1. It is important in dealing with the matters under discussion to consider final rather than provisional or preliminary figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I consulted the Irish Reports for the High Court and found a judgment of Mr. Justice Budd on page 119 of the 1961 volume which was very clear on the issue. Mr. Justice Budd said that although the preliminary figures of the 1946 census were provided in the case in question, it was the final figures to which regard must be had for proper purposes of comparison as to the distribution of population. It is very clearly cut that one must have the benefit of the final rather than the preliminary figures. A report of Supreme Court proceedings contains a judgment of Chief Justice Maguire in which he stated that the only way to ascertain the exact figure is by reference to the last completed census of the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I accept Deputy Gilmore's point that there could be a challenge. A challenge can be made to anything and no one can stand in my place and argue, irrespective of party, that one will never be made. The basis we have adopted in all cases to date of waiting for the final figure in volume 1 is supported not only by logic but by the language used in High and Supreme Court cases, especially the Budd judgment in the O'Donovan case. It would be imprudent of a Minister to change a long-standing practice based on strong legal advice to move to a scenario in which we would rely on the initial figures. The Deputy is correct, there could be a legal challenge. It would be much more probable if one were to depart from practice and go for initial rather than final figures.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanPower" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_289">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_615">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_616">I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on Second Stage of the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill 2004. This Bill provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for certain health and social care professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Statutory registration is a system underpinned by law whereby each member of a profession may be recognised by a specified body as competent to practice within that profession. As a legally binding process, with a mechanism for the prosecution of offences, it ensures a robust system that serves the dual function of protecting the public while ensuring that the good reputation of a profession is not called into question by the poor practices of an individual member.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Although a number of professions have informal or voluntary systems of registration organised by their respective professional bodies, only five health professions are currently subject to statutory registration in Ireland: doctors, dentists, nurses, opticians and pharmacists. The health strategy, Quality and Fairness — a Health System for You, gave a firm commitment to strengthen and expand provisions for the statutory registration of health professionals. The Health and Social Care Professionals Bill therefore represents an important step forward in strengthening the regulatory environment and is the first of three Bills intended to improve and develop the regulatory environment for health professions. Further legislation will follow for medical practitioners and the nursing profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Equity, a people-centred approach, quality and accountability are the four tenets of the health strategy. The health strategy is clear on strengthening and clarifying accountability systems. It is clear on the value of building on quality initiatives. It is also clear on the importance of good human resources management. The system of statutory registration put forward in the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill helps deliver these essential objectives. It will ensure that members of the public are guided, protected and informed, so that they can be confident that health and social care professionals providing services are properly qualified, competent and fit to practice. The system proposed will also ensure professional conduct and the maintenance of high standards of professional education and training among health and social care professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The principles underlying effective regulation of health professionals as set out in the health strategy and the various initiatives on regulatory reform, including the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland and the White Paper, Regulating Better, have been key considerations in the development of the proposed system. The most important consideration is that the interests of service users head the policy agenda. We all share the view that the present system of voluntary self-regulation can operate well and the professions themselves must be commended on the development of these voluntary systems. However, in well developed and established professions, even better protection to the public can be achieved through statutory registration. It allows the consumer to be confident that the person providing a service is properly qualified, of good standing and competent to practice in his or her profession. Statutory registration has long been advocated by many of the professions.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The health and social care professions have been to the forefront in setting and maintaining standards of patient care and professionalism. They have been proactive in working towards a statutory system of registration and are supportive of the general principles underpinning the system. A consultation process with the relevant professional bodies took place throughout 2000 with a discussion document, prepared by my Department, forming the basis for the process. A series of one-day facilitated workshops followed at which all of the major issues raised by the discussion document, and others raised by the professional bodies, were considered in some detail. These discussions culminated in the publication in October 2000 of a document titled, Statutory Registration for Health and Social Care Professionals — Proposals for the Way Forward, in which the practical arrangements for a system of statutory registration for health and social care professionals was set out in some detail. The proposals set out in this document emerged from a very positive spirit of co-operation and openness from all parties, without which it would not have been possible to devise the outline scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">There are fundamental reasons for the proposals put forward in the Bill. Most importantly, we need to ensure the delivery of the best possible service to patients and service users. This is our primary concern when developing a system of registration for health and social care professionals in Ireland. We are living in an age where we enjoy more personal control with regard to our own health as individuals. We have more choice in health care than previous generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">As users of professional services we need to be assured that the service providers meet accepted standards. We must know there is a proper forum to bring justified complaints that will deal fairly with those complaints. The system of registration proposed allows for investigation of any allegations of incompetence or misconduct and for the taking of disciplinary action. It also provides a mechanism whereby practitioners compromised by ill-health or addiction can be appropriately dealt with. The Bill also provides for a mediation process and other informal means for less serious complaints by agreement of both parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The system proposed provides a legislative framework for the appraisal and approval of education and training courses and the proper development of education and training across the professions. It will provide a more widely informed and participative forum for the administration and implementation of the EU directives on the mutual recognition of qualifications in EU member states. It will also lead to greater consistency in the application of these directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">As with other systems of statutory registration in Ireland, the system proposed for health and social care professions will be self-financing, that is funded from the contributions of registered members. This proposed system of statutory registration will apply, in the first instance, to 12 health and social care professions: chiropodists, clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers, and speech and language therapists, regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector or are self-employed. It is estimated that 14,000 practitioners will be subject to regulation, approximately 15% of whom are employed in the private sector. These initial 12 professions are long established providers of health and social care within the health service and in some instances have a long history of self-regulation. In addition, the qualifications of the majority of these professions are already regulated within the public health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">While the proposed system of statutory registration set out in the Bill will apply in the first instance to the 12 health and social care professions I have outlined, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health and Children to include, by regulation, additional health and social care professions in the proposed statutory system as appropriate, on the basis of specific criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">Given the number of professionals involved it was considered inappropriate to establish a separate registration system for any individual profession. It was considered vital to develop an integrated, mutually supportive system of registration across the professions. The regulatory structure proposed in the Bill therefore comprises a registration board for each of the professions to be registered, a health and social care professionals council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters. A chief executive officer and staff will administer the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Each registration board will comprise 13 members, six being registrants of the designated profession with seven members appointed by the Minister for Health and Children representing management in the public and private-voluntary health sector, the public interest and the education sector. Each registration board will determine criteria for registration and will establish and maintain a register of professionals who meet these criteria and will also approve and monitor education and training programmes for the relevant profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The health and social care professionals council will comprise 25 members. Membership provisions ensure an appropriate balance with public accountability and provide for representation by the registered professions — 12 members; consumers — nine members; management in the public and private or voluntary health sector — two members; the third level education sector — one member; and an independent chairperson. The health and social care professionals council will, through appropriate co-ordination and oversight, ensure the consistency and coherence of the system as a whole and will promote uniformity of practice among registration boards. The council's co-ordinating role in procedures is particularly relevant in respect of disciplinary matters where a substantial legal and administrative burdenmay perhaps occur and central expertise indealing with complex legal issues can be developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">To deal effectively with complaints and other disciplinary matters, there will be three statutory committees common to all the registered professions within the system. A preliminary proceedings committee will, following notification of a complaint, give an opinion on whether there is sufficient cause to warrant the taking of further action regarding the complaint. A health committee will deal with cases where a registered practitioner's ability to practise is impaired by reason of a physical or mental ailment, an emotional disturbance or an addiction to alcohol or drugs. A professional conduct committee will investigate complaints against registered practitioners in respect of professional misconduct or poor professional performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">If a preliminary proceedings committee considers that a complaint should be investigated further, it is referred to a committee of inquiry — either a professional conduct committee or a health committee — for hearing unless, with the consent of the complainant and the practitioner concerned, the complaint is referred for mediation or other forms of dispute resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Hearings of a committee of inquiry will generally be heard in public. In the course of a hearing, a committee of inquiry will be empowered to receive evidence, enforce the attendance of witnesses, examine witnesses and compel the production of records. If considered appropriate, a professional conduct committee may transfer the complaint for hearing by a health committee and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">In extreme and urgent circumstances, the council may apply to the High Court to suspend a practitioner pending completion of an inquiry if it considers it is in the public interest to do so. Following completion of an inquiry, one or more of the following sanctions may be imposed on a registered practitioner: admonishment or censure, attachment of conditions to registration, suspension for a specified period, cancellation of registration or prohibition from applying for a specified period for restoration to the register. No sanction becomes effective until confirmed by the High Court and it may be made public following this confirmation.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">Certain titles will be protected under the legislation and the Minister is empowered to protect additional titles. It will be an offence for an unregistered practitioner to use a protected title or to represent himself or herself falsely as being a registered practitioner. The Bill was amended and its accountability and transparency provisions were strengthened during its passage through Seanad Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">Let us consider the main provisions of the Bill as passed by the Seanad. Section 4 designates the 12 health and social care professions I specified to be subject to the provisions of the Act, regardless of whether they work in the public or private sectors, and provides for the designation of additional health and social care professions by regulation in the future as appropriate and in line with specific criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Sections 6, 7 and 8 establish the health and social care professionals council, define the object of the council as being to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions, provide that the council must exercise its powers and perform its functions in the public interest and set out the functions of the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Section 9 lays down the membership of the council as comprising 25 members, 12 being members of the registered professions with 13 members representing the management of the public and voluntary health or social care sector, third level educational establishments and the interests of the public to ensure an appropriate balance with public accountability. Sections 11 and 12 provide for the council to appoint a chief executive officer and staff to manage the administration and business of the council and the registration boards. The chief executive officer also acts as registrar of each registration board. Section 17, in keeping with the principle of the council's being a self-financing body, provides that the council must meet, out of funds at its disposal, expenses incurred by the council, the registration boards and any committees established.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">Section 22 enables the council to make rules providing for such matters as the form and manner in which registration boards are to maintain registers, the details relating to registrants that, in addition to their names, are to be entered in registers and the receiving and recording of evidence by committees of inquiry. It also requires the council to publish a draft of any rule and invite comments on the draft before a date specified in the invitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Sections 26 and 27 provide for the establishment of a registration board for each of the 12 professions to be registered, define the object of each registration board as being to protect the public by fostering high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of that profession and set out the functions of each registration board. Section 28 lays down the membership of each registration board as being 13 persons, including six persons from the particular profession elected by members of that profession and seven from outside the profession representative of the management of the public and private health or social care sector, third level educational establishments and the interests of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Section 31 enables each registration board, with the council's approval, to make by-laws regarding such matters as qualifications attesting to the standard of proficiency required for registration; procedures for assessing qualifications awarded, training or professional experience acquired outside the State; education, training and continuing professional development of registrants; and adoption and revision of a code of professional conduct and ethics. Where a proposed by-law might result in an additional burden being imposed on the Exchequer, both the council and the Minister must approve the draft by-law. Section 32 requires a registration board to publish a draft of any by-laws it proposes to make and to invite comment on the draft. It also requires a registration board to submit certain draft by-laws to the Competition Authority for its opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Sections 36 to 38 provide that each registration board must establish and maintain a register of members of that profession and the procedure to be followed by a person seeking registration. Sections 43 and 44 provide that a registrant may appeal a decision of a registration board to refuse to grant or restore registration to the council and subsequently to the High Court. Section 46 requires each registration board to make the register available for inspection by members of the public at all reasonable times and also requires each registration board to publish the register, by electronic means or otherwise, at least once a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">Section 48 enables each registration board to approve or withdraw approval for education and training programmes for the education and training of candidates for registration. Section 49 requires a registration board to monitor the ongoing suitability of education and training programmes approved by the board, including any clinical training and experience being provided, at least once in every five years. Section 50 sets out the definitions to be used in regard to complaints, inquiries and discipline.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Section 51 requires the council to establish a preliminary proceedings committee, a professional conduct committee and a health committee to perform functions and exercise powers in regard to complaints, inquiries and discipline and sets out the membership of these committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Section 52 enables any person to make a complaint to the council concerning a registrant on the following grounds: professional misconduct; poor professional performance; impairment of the registrant's ability to practise by reason of a physical or mental ailment, an emotional disturbance or an addiction to alcohol or drugs; a failure to comply with a term or condition of registration imposed under fitness to practise procedures; a failure to comply with an undertaking or any action specified in a consent given under section 61; a contravention of this legislation, the rules or by-laws; and a conviction in the State for an offence triable on indictment or a conviction outside the State for an offence consisting of acts or omissions that, if done or made in the State, would constitute an offence triable on indictment.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">A complaint may also be made on the grounds of professional misconduct or poor professional performance even though the matter to which the complaint relates occurred outside the State. Section 53 provides that the council must refer each complaint to a preliminary proceedings committee for its opinion on whether there is sufficient cause to warrant further action being taken regarding the complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">Section 56 provides that where there is sufficient cause to warrant further action being taken on foot of a complaint, the preliminary proceedings committee must refer the complaint either for resolution by mediation or other informal means or to a professional conduct committee or a health committee. If a preliminary proceedings committee is informed that a complaint referred to mediation cannot be resolved, the committee must refer the complaint to a committee of inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Section 58 provides that the conduct of a hearing and a hearing before a professional conduct committee will generally be held in public. A hearing before a health committee generally will be held in private. At the hearing, the registrar presents evidence in support of the complaint, testimony of witnesses is given on oath and there is a full right to cross-examine witnesses and to call evidence in defence and reply. This section provides that a committee to which a complaint is referred may transfer the complaint to another committee of inquiry but only if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so and that the legal rights of the registrant will not be prejudiced.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Section 60 enables the council to apply to the High Court for an order directing a registration board to suspend a registrant's registration pending completion of an inquiry, if it considers that the action is necessary to protect the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Section 63 requires that on completion of an inquiry a committee of inquiry must submit its findings in writing to the council, and specifies the items that must be included in the report. Section 64 provides that on receiving the report of a committee of inquiry concerning a complaint, the council shall, if allegations have not been substantiated, dismiss the complaint or, if allegations have been substantiated, request the registration board concerned to recommend one or more than one disciplinary sanction to be imposed on the registrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Section 65 provides that the registration board concerned must recommend that one or more than one of the following disciplinary sanctions be imposed on the registrant: an admonishment or a censure; the attachment of conditions to his or her registration, including restrictions on the practice of the designated profession by the registrant; the suspension of his or her registration for a specified period; the cancellation of his or her registration; and a prohibition from applying for a specified period for restoration to the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Section 66 provides that following consideration of the registration board's recommendation, the council may direct the board concerned to impose on the registrant one or more than one of the disciplinary sanctions referred to in that section.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Section 68 provides that a direction given by the council to a registration board to impose a disciplinary sanction, other than an admonishment or censure, does not take effect unless the direction is confirmed by the High Court. Section 69 provides that a registrant to whom a direction to impose a disciplinary sanction, other than an admonishment or censure, relates may apply to the High Court within 30 days for an order cancelling the direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Section 70 provides that if the registrant does not, within the time allowed, apply to the court for an order cancelling the direction, the council may apply to the High Court for an order confirming a direction to a registration board to impose a disciplinary sanction, other than an admonishment or censure, on a registrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Section 73 provides that the council may direct a registration board to restore to its register the name of any person whose registration has been cancelled and may attach to the registration any conditions it considers appropriate. Section 76 provides that the council shall notify the Minister and employer, if known, as soon as practicable after any sanction imposed on a registered professional takes effect. This section provides that the council must also notify the Minister and employer, if known, if it comes to its attention that, under the law of another country, the above actions have been taken in relation to a registrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Section 77 provides that the council may, if it is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so, advise the public when a sanction imposed on a registered practitioner takes effect. Section 79 makes it an offence to use the title of any registered practitioner as set out in section 4 or prescribed by the Minister by regulation, unless entitled to do so. Sections 82 to 89, inclusive, provide for the dissolution of the National Social Work Qualifications Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">Section 91 sets out grandparenting arrangements for those practitioners who have been in practice at any time during the five years ending on the day the register for the particular profession is opened.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Section 95 confers power on the Minister to make regulations for matters prescribed in the Act and provides that such regulations must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that either House may annul such regulations by a resolution passed within 21 sitting days after the making of the regulation. This section provides that the Minister may make regulations to prescribe additional titles to be protected for use by registrants only if a draft of the proposed regulation has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">Schedule 1 sets out miscellaneous provisions for the council. Schedule 2 sets out miscellaneous provisions for each registration board. Schedule 3 lays down the qualifications required by existing practitioners to be granted registration under Part 9 — the grandparenting provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">This Bill is a significant step in meeting the task set by the health strategy as regards the regulatory environment for the health professions. As I have stressed, members of the public are entitled to guidance and protection so that they are confident that the professional providing the service is properly qualified and competent and that unqualified or insufficiently qualified persons are excluded from professional activity. For their part, the professions require protection, including that through a mechanism for sanctioning professional misconduct, so that the good name and reputation of the majority are not damaged by the actions of a very tiny minority.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">I commend this Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_290">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_661">A great injustice was bestowed on the Minister of State to have to read through all that. I read through the legislation's memorandum as well as the Tánaiste's speech on the Bill in the Seanad and I had a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> every few minutes while listening to the Minister of State’s speech. I am sure it must have been just as painful for him to read through 30 minutes of that as it was for me to listen to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">As regards the Tánaiste's speech in the Seanad, she made a few important points. She said that this was the first of three Bills to reform the regulatory environment for health professionals, with legislation for medical practitioners and nurses to follow. It was pointed out that we have been waiting for this legislation for almost 20 years. I hope that, when the Tánaiste stated that this would be followed soon by new medical practitioners legislation and nurses legislation, it will be in our lifetime as politicians rather than in the lifetime of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">It was pointed out that the 2001 health strategy was based on four key principles, namely, equality, people-centredness, quality and accountability. We must constantly focus on points such as those when talking about legislation. Legislation can often look very good on paper but, as happened recently, it can go badly wrong when tested in the High Court or the Supreme Court. The Tánaiste said that the vision adopted in the strategy for the future health system set great store on treating people with dignity and respect. She said the health strategy envisaged that action would be taken to strengthen the customer focus of service providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">It is important to reiterate these points because there is an element of fine words having been spoken as regards the health service over the past couple of years, and the health strategy was very much the basis for many of these fine words. However, it is delivery and ensuring that people benefit from this so-called patient-centred approach from the health service that is important. I will expand more on that later. For the moment I am just putting forward the themes I intend to deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">My last quotation from the Tánaiste's Seanad speech is that strengthening and clarifying, accountability and measurement of excellence are the priorities. That basically is what this Bill is all about. It is about protecting the consumer or the patient using the legislation we pass in this House as legislators. Before we talk too much about this legislation, we should look at what is already in existence. The setting up of the council will be a dramatic initiative. We abolished 250 health board positions last December and we are establishing 186 regulatory bodies and councils under this legislation. It is not a case of self-regulation, as with the Medical Council. It is to be a statutory body, and obviously the Government will keep control of the regulations and the regulation of people in these professions.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">There are some parallels, however, with the Medical Council. Many fine ideas are proposed, for example, about training, regulation and registration of people. Over the next couple of weeks a report will be published on one medical practitioner. It will focus very much on Dr. Michael Neary and what happened in Drogheda hospital. The report will be extremely critical of the medical profession and the Medical Council, the self-regulatory body of doctors. I do not seek to scapegoat the council but to make the point that, irrespective of good intentions, systems can dramatically fail patients. Although I have not read the report, having been involved in much of the debate on Dr. Neary, I know in my heart it will be extremely critical of the Medical Council and doctors, including many consultants outside Drogheda who were involved in dealing with the events at the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Whether one is a medical director or consultant colleague of a bad consultant, doctors are slow to report each other. The Garda Síochána is often accused of protecting its own out of self-interest. This accusation will also be levelled against doctors and there is no doubt a certain element of self-interest is evident in all professions with politicians being no exception. Deputy McManus will agree that this trait has been much in evidence in recent months in the Joint Committee on Health and Children at which certain Government Members have engaged in protecting their own, rather than pursuing responsibility and accountability to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">Sometimes the reason doctors refuse to make a complaint against a colleague is not to cover up issues but because no genuine protection is afforded to those who wish to do so. The Dr. Neary affair is a case in point. It exploded into the public arena because two student midwives who, to the best of my knowledge received much of their training in Northern Ireland where matters of this nature are dealt with under a different legislative framework, were horrified by what they saw taking place in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and complained to their supervisor. The matter came to light when the supervisor took their complaints further.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Why are consultants, powerful individuals in the hospital system in their own right, afraid to report colleagues, even to the Medical Council? One of the main reasons is the fear of litigation. If one cannot prove an accusation one makes about a colleague, one may well find oneself in the High Court, even if the allegation is true. Hearsay and circumstantial evidence are not sufficient as one must be in a position to demonstrate that problems exist. If, for any reason, one is proved wrong, the accused person can sue one for defamation.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">A further problem is the lack of political and, in some respects, administrative support. A case in point, which may not be crystal clear but with which the Minister of State, as a matter of interest, should familiarise himself, involves an orthopaedic surgeon in Cork, Mr. Maha Lingham, who has found himself without a job. Mr. Maha Lingham, who worked as a temporary consultant in Cork University Hospital for 12 years, was one of the most successful orthopaedic surgeons in the region and had a tremendous workload. He was also one of a few people carrying out extremely specialised orthopaedic surgery. I do not understand why he is without a job.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The Minister must address the absence of political and administrative support for consultants who wish to make a complaint and the fact that they may find themselves out on a limb as colleagues close ranks. Legislation on the medical profession, including this Bill, does not protect patients or doctors because it is ineffective when those at the top show weakness or lack of leadership. Fundamental changes are needed to make this type of legislation work. In this respect, I fully support my constituency colleague, Deputy Howlin, who has repeatedly called for the introduction of whistleblower legislation. The Bill is too reliant on people being genuine and well intentioned. We must bear in mind that if someone wishes to play the legal system or has ulterior motives or other agendas, the legislation will fail those it is meant to protect. For this reason, the Government should consider the introduction of whistleblower legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">It may transpire that a complaint made against a person is not completely true and many such cases have come before the Medical Council, which receives a large number of complaints about medical practitioners. Patients, for instance, complain about the manner in which they have been treated by a doctor. I have every sympathy for the doctors in question, many of whom I know to be caring and considerate and have been badly affected by complaints made against them. Such complaints are not all malicious as patients genuinely believe they have been badly treated. Even if it is shown by the Medical Council that a doctor was not negligent or incompetent and is declared innocent after 12 months or two years, he or she may still feel wronged.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">We need whistleblower legislation to encourage people in senior positions, doctors and professionals, to act if they see bad practice. In the course of 12 years — 18 if one includes my medical training, a period when I had ample opportunity to see how other consultants work — I have seen a number of things I would not encourage. As junior doctors, we were under severe pressure not to take action and, as a result, we did nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">There is nothing in place to protect consultants who make a complaint, even if it is not substantiated in the long term. This is the case throughout the public service, including in the Garda Síochána, the teaching profession and the medical profession, from physiotherapists to chiropodists and all the professions to which the Minister of State referred, as well as those which, I hope, will seek registration on the new body. If we do not have a proper mechanism to enable people to make their views and concerns known without having to worry that if they put a concern in writing or make a complaint, a lily-white or weak-hearted administrator will release the information.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanPower" eId="spk_291" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_675">The Deputy could use a better term than "lily-white".</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_676">We cannot trust that information will not be leaked. We have seen how a junior Minister released information which, in some respects, should have been considered confidential. We need to protect people from this kind of practice by offering substantial support and protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The legislation is the way forward and is, therefore, welcome. There is far too much <i>ad hoc </i>regulation of the health care professions. Nevertheless, two major concerns arise. Some professionals believe they have been left out of the legislation, for example, some titles are not specifically mentioned. One of the most important issues to arise since the introduction of the legislation — the Minister of State will have heard about it — is the title of “physical therapists”. Every Member of the House has received correspondence from physiotherapists and physical therapists on the matter. This issue must be addressed on Committee Stage. If it is not resolved before the legislation is enacted, the title of “physical therapist” will remain outside its scope, thus creating more problems in the future. The Government should take the bull by the horns and deal with the issue now as it will crop up in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">A number of other organisations have been omitted from the scope of the Bill. With the complexity of medicine and the many qualifications available, we will see many other bodies seeking to be included under this legislation. In the same way the Medical Council has given status to the medical profession, patients will want to see all health care providers covered by governing councils. The public will think those who are not included under the legislation are alternative or unqualified practitioners. That will have a detrimental effect on many people who hold qualifications who feel they should be included under the legislation. Eventually someone will take a test case to the High Court on the issue. To serve the public interest we must reduce ambiguity and at some stage a Government will have to legislate for alternative practitioners. It is becoming so complex that people do not know where they are going.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Psychologists are included in the legislation but some people call themselves both psychologists and counsellors. We must make the qualifications needed crystal clear. People qualify as psychologists having studied for a long time at a third level institution that is not a university. They may well be left out under the legislation even though we would currently consider them to be psychotherapists. Others who do not have a qualification will also be left out — perhaps the legislation could make that differentiation because patients and doctors do not know how qualified many of those described as counsellors and psychotherapists are.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">If a profession other than the 12 mentioned in the legislation feels it should be included, are there any means to consider that? If it established itself and fulfilled the rules and regulations, could the Minister issue a regulation to include such a group in the legislation? It would have to set up a regulatory body with 13 members. Where would that fit in with the council? Would it be difficult to nominate a member to the council?</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The majority of the 12 organisations mentioned participate in the public service so perhaps the Minister is thinking that once they are covered, the public service remit has been fulfilled. Does he intend to look after the other bodies that might not have a role in the public service?</p>
          <p eId="para_682">What is a medical scientist? Is someone working in a pharmaceutical company, in a laboratory in a hospital or a science graduate doing research at university, perhaps controversially on embryos, a medical scientist? We have not teased this out. We must always keep in mind factors external to those we are addressing. If someone is carrying out stem cell or embryo research, would he or she come under this legislation and would he or she break the law if doing something that this House had not approved?</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Has the Minister named the representative bodies for the 12 professions mentioned in the legislation? Physiotherapists are represented by two organisations. Which will be nominated as responsible for looking after physiotherapists? Many of the bodies have at least two representative organisations and there could be conflict if one is chosen above another. We should examine this on Committee stage because the Bill is unclear at present on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">All of the organisations named in the Minister of State's speech are involved in either the health or social welfare services. Why, then, are the ministerial nominees for these bodies named by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment? That is strange. Why is the Minister for Health and Children not nominating them? Perhaps I have a problem with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, nominating people because his nominations to the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service left lingering problems that the Tánaiste might still have to address before the next election.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The sections on registration, education and training, complaints, inquiries and disciplinary procedures are mostly fine; they follow the criteria used by the Irish Medical Council on making complaints. The council, however, is moving towards all professional conduct committee hearings being heard in public. That has created anxiety for members of the medical profession because if there is a committee hearing in public, it can be reported in the media. If the committee finds all charges baseless, however, the media is not concerned about reporting that. Many of the professions will find themselves in a unique position when complaints are made about them. It is difficult for patients to get a hearing and many of the professionals will be in for a surprise when this legislation is enacted. At least the health committees will be held in private because they cover emotional subjects for everyone involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Under section 58, there is provision that each committee of inquiry has the powers, rights and privilege vested in the High Court or a judge of the High Court relating to enforcing the attendance of witnesses, examining witnesses on oath and compelling the production of records. In the discussions by the Joint Committee on Health and Children on illegal nursing home charges, attempts were made to ascertain Deputy Martin's responsibilities as Minister for Health and Children and those of the Ministers of State and special advisers. We hit a stone wall as nothing had been committed in writing. When we sought legal opinion during the course of our inquiries, we were referred to the case of the Abbeylara incident sub-committee and whether Members can make judgments on people that have a negative outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Has this been explored in how the Medical Council works or how this committee will work given that it is not part of the Judiciary? Are there aspects of the Abbeylara incident sub-committee case where negative findings cannot be made on an individual? Has this been cleared with the Attorney General? The Medical Council is the only one that functions to any significant degree. However, the Bill will see the establishment of 12 more similar bodies. Has legal opinion been sought as to whether these committees can operate on this basis and make negative findings?</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Section 61 states: "A committee of inquiry may, at any time after a complaint is referred to it, request the registrant concerned to do one or more of the following ... consent to being admonished or censured by the Council." I will ask for this provision to be clarified on Committee Stage. It is almost saying that one must consent to whatever punishment is meted out by the committee before the opportunity is given to hear what the complaint is or make a defence case. An individual should be allowed to wait to hear the full facts of the case against him or her before consenting to being censured by the council looking after his or her professional interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">While my points are to ensure the legislation works, it is welcome. There is no point in going through all this rigmarole, establishing one council and 12 regulatory bodies with 189 people being taken on in the administrative set-up, if it will not work properly. The Government must examine whistleblowers legislation as it will make this Bill work in protecting patients in the legal environment. While much of the legislation passed by the House never finds its way into public discussion, it is still our role to ensure legislation protects people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_293">
          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_690">Many people will be surprised to learn that many disciplines in the health sector are not already regulated by law. This Bill has taken a long time to come before the House. It has been mirrored in the long wait for the medical practitioners Bill, sought for many years. I only hope we are not going to have the same drawn-out process for legislation to establish an inspectorate of institutions caring for the elderly. Unfortunately, the track record indicates these matters take some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">The Bill presents an elaborate structure with 180 appointments to be made. The Health Service Executive does not have a role in this, although it was established to manage the health service, implement Government policy and ensure services ran in a streamlined way. Instead, the Minister for Health and Children will make the bulk of appointments and, in some cases, with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This type of structure provides rich and fertile ground for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to extend their patronage far and wide.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">We need to be conscious of this when ensuring best practice is followed. The record is not very reassuring, particularly when the Minister has total power in making appointments across a whole swathe of disciplines. In recent times, we saw the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, refuse to accept any responsibility for duties he should have discharged and clearly did not. It does not augur well, not because the legislation is wrong but because we have bad government in good times. This presents the possibility of extending that bad government into new areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The complaints procedures set out in the Bill have been carefully thought out. However, it shows up that, for some time, there has been a lacuna whereby there is no complaints authority. Legislation was promised but was absorbed into the Health Service Executive. It is difficult for people to see where and how they can make a complaint against any treatment or care they have received.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Already the Bill's terms will have to be extended because so many disciplines have developed at community and primary care level for which provision must be made. We all recognise this is a process that must be continued. One example is the role psychotherapy plays in health care. It is being widely availed of where people can afford it. It plays a significant part in providing therapy for people and it needs to be recognised in a statutory way.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The points made about a whistleblowers Bill are valid but have not been answered. Recently, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, said that a whistleblowers Bill was proceeding when he rejected an amendment to the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill. On the other hand, both the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance said on the Order of Business that the Government had determined there would be no whistleblowers Bill. Instead it will be done on a sectorial basis. The Government cannot have it both ways. By trying to do so, it is simply looking foolish. That is not to reduce the importance of the issue. The Labour Party presented the Government with an opportunity to provide a much-needed whistleblowers Bill. However, it is regrettable that this state of affairs continues. When one examines health care provision, we have terrible examples of where whistleblowing would have saved people from suffering and, in some cases, death. However, this did not happen because people felt unprotected and unsure about their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">In general, I welcome this legislation which seeks to introduce a system of statutory registration for health and social care in Ireland. The stated purpose of this Bill is to establish a system to ensure that members of the public are protected and informed so that they may be confident that the professional providing the service is properly qualified, competent and of good standing. It is vital that the legitimate concerns of members of the public are addressed and legislated for in this way. The proposed system rightly seeks to ensure professional conduct and the promotion of a high standard of professional education and training among health and social care professionals. A health and social care professionals council will be established to facilitate this.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">No one would argue with the stated aim of this council, which is "to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions".</p>
          <p eId="para_698">All this is to be welcomed by both the public it seeks to protect and the professions it targets as it will help to ensure the protection of their name and reputation and offers a new level of transparency and accountability. The Labour Party's health policies and documents have long advocated a health service that delivers the best quality of care efficiently to all citizens as a right.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">However, there are issues of quantity as well as quality which the Government must address and which are not covered by this Bill such as the delays caused by a shortage of occupational therapists at health board level and the costs levied, at times unfairly, on medical card patients for scarce chiropody services. It is not acceptable that there is a wide variation in the level of services available in different parts of the country. While there are instances — this requires further clarification — where medical card holders are entitled to community care services, it is not always possible to get the required services. Community care services include the public health nursing service, home help, day care, respite care and so on. These are the services which one would normally consider to be community care. The rules about which community care services must be provided differ in accordance with the different services. In some cases, health boards are obliged to provide services, while in others, they have discretion about whether to make the service available. This entire area must be clarified and clear guidelines must be published.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">There is a lack of clarity about eligibility and entitlement to the services. Health boards were established to provide certain services, set out in statute. That function now belongs to the HSE. The omnibus term "health and personal social services" is undefined but is used to cover all services provided under previous legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">On the one hand, Members are familiar with the issue of health services to which there is statutory entitlement but which are not provided, while on the other hand, the statutory basis of some services which are provided by the HSE is uncertain, to put it mildly.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The Department of Health and Children appears to be aware of the problem and there are hopes it will address it in a comprehensive way, in the context of a general updating and clarification of the health service framework. My concerns are, first, that chronic structural problems, which are left unresolved, are prone to explode in an acute manner. The nursing homes debacle must have taught us that. Second, the programme of health service reform seems to have concentrated on assessing what services need to be delivered and what mechanism should be adopted for their delivery, to the complete exclusion of the question as to what services must be delivered by statutory mandate and the need to review and update that mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">I do not argue that unauthorised personal social services should be immediately cancelled. On the contrary, these are vital services and are provided for people with the highest degrees of dependency. My point is that the failure to legislate properly can only result in <i>ad hoc</i>, non-statutory service provision that is piecemeal, disjointed and entirely inadequate to satisfy widespread unmet needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">I wish to conclude this point by quoting from the famous legal opinion on nursing home charges provided to the South Eastern Health Board in October 2002: "It is a remarkable feature of the health services in Ireland that such vast sums of money are expended on a system, the statutory basis for which is so confused and haphazard and where practice seems so dislocated from statutory theory."</p>
          <p eId="para_705">I will now address some other outstanding issues concerning this Bill, which it is important to put on the record. The Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, the professional body representing physiotherapists in Ireland, has expressed its concerns to me regarding the issue of protection of title. Since the early 1980s the ISCP has worked with successive Ministers and departmental officials regarding statutory registration for the profession and hence for the protection of the public. However, due to the slow progress of this work, the present difficulties have arisen, which essentially pertain to the use or lack of use of the term "physical therapist".</p>
          <p eId="para_706">There are grave concerns about the issue of title as it appears in the present Bill and there may be serious implications to the detriment of the public which it does not address. These must be considered further and the Government must address it when we deal with this legislation on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">Within Great Britain and Northern Ireland and possibly some other countries, the titles "physical therapist" and "physiotherapist" apply to the same profession with the same professional qualifications. The titles are interchangeable and the professional qualifications and requirements are the same for both titles. This possible area of confusion must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">In Ireland in recent years a group of practitioners has begun to use the title "physical therapist". In the absence of relevant legislation protecting title up to now, Irish physiotherapists could not prevent this perceived misuse of their associated title. The use of the title "physical therapist" in Ireland by a group with less education and training standards has led to confusion among the public. Members of the public have, it is claimed, contacted the office of the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists to find out why their physical therapy fees had not been reimbursed by VHI or BUPA, only to discover that the practitioner they attended was not a physiotherapist. This is a possible area of confusion in the public eye concerning the two practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The ISCP commissioned Millward Brown IMS to carry out a survey of public opinion on this issue. The results showed that only one person in every three surveyed stated that he or she knew the difference between a physiotherapist and a physical therapist, the latter title being that used incorrectly in Ireland at present. The results also showed that more than one in four believe that a physical therapist requires a university qualification, which is not the case. When representatives of the older population were asked how similar or different they thought a physiotherapist and a physical therapist might be, half of those aged 65 and over answered that they did not know.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">This demonstrates an even greater degree of confusion among a potentially more vulnerable, older population. The ISCP believes that the best way to protect the public would be to protect both titles for the profession of physiotherapy in Ireland in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">There are differences between the two bodies currently practising in Ireland, both in terms of the level of education requirements and the extent of involvement and interaction with the medical profession and other allied health professions.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">While the ISCP states that it respects the rights of the groups currently calling themselves "physical therapists" to practise and to their livelihood, the issue is not about livelihood or practice but the use of title and the confusion it causes.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The practitioners who have adopted the title "physical therapist" could continue to carry out their practice, possibly under a different title, because they also have legitimate concerns which no one would disregard. However, confusion of this type does not benefit the person availing of the services and it is important that this is not disregarded by the Minister. Various arguments have been put forward about using different titles such as "State registered physiotherapists" or "certified physical therapists". This is an area that we must address.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Senator Henry raised an issue highlighted by the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists in Ireland. While an amendment to delete the word "chiropodist" and substitute the word "podiatrist" was not accepted by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, there was some confusion over the issue. The reason for the proposed amendment from the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists is as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_715">The reason we seek to have this amended is that professionals wishing to register are required to have a Bachelor of Science in Podiatry — qualifications required by existing practitioners, thus it would be anomalous to retain the name "Chiropodist" only. Both titles have been in use for over 20 years now. This degree qualification has succeeded the Diploma since the early eighties. If the name Podiatry is not so well known in Ireland this is because we do not yet have a School of Podiatry in Ireland and those wishing to study Podiatry do so at one of the Universities in the UK. Recent legislation in the UK has protected both titles "Chiropodist" and Podiatrist". Indeed we risk losing Irish graduates in Podiatry to the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">I would have thought such a Bill would have provided an opportunity to deal with that type of practical issue of title.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">There are 12 professionals the Minister of State mentioned. They are all core professionals within the primary community care sector and are employed in the acute hospital sector. They have been selected for registration in this Bill because they are long-established providers of health and social care. In most instances, they have a system of self-regulation. However, it leaves scope for concern about the newer and increasingly popular disciplines of which people are availing, whether counselling or therapy. We need to discuss how standards are to be maintained in those areas which are relatively new, but which are growing and can be of benefit to many people who seek them out. However, people need some type of safeguard that the service of which they avail meets best practice and is regulated in a way that will protect the patient in terms of care. One hears stories of counsellors who are not properly trained and who in some cases do more damage than good. There are enough examples in the area of complementary medicine, of serious misdemeanours and damage being done which is not good for complementary medical practitioners and people in the area of complementary health who are trying to maintain good standards, to provide a service and who are seeking registration and regulation to protect their particular discipline.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The university providers of the State's four professional social work education and training programmes have also raised concerns. Again, while they welcome the registration and public protection aspects of the Bill, they have raised concerns about the implications of the Bill for social work education and accreditation. Social workers represent one of the largest groups among the 12 professionals covered by this Bill and is the only group to have an established statutory qualifications board as opposed to self-regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">The National Social Work Qualification Board has developed highly respected standards, procedures and expertise in the monitoring and regulation of professional education prior to awarding professional qualification. It has also developed its other functions of assessment of non-national qualifications, strategic manpower planning, research into the education and training of social workers, facilitating cross-border mobility, provision of induction training and the collection and publication of statistical information. There are concerns that the proposed social work registration board could have significantly reduced functions, capacity and resources in comparison with the NSWQB and that this change could have a detrimental effect on social work education and, therefore, ultimately on the quality of social work services. Disruption or delays in strategic manpower planning and accreditation of non-national qualifications may also generate considerable costs for public bodies and employers. This is an important point.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The area of social work has expanded enormously and, generally speaking, people will recognise the universities have performed an important role in developing that sector and in ensuring good standards, research and planning. It would be most regrettable if the impact of any change in the law was to downgrade standards. When statutory change is being made, there is always the possibility of an impact where a highly developed sector is being regulated or registered for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">There are many examples of people who have, or who have tried to come here from abroad to work but who have faced all kinds of obstacles. Nurses, doctors and other health professionals from abroad, who we desperately need, cannot get registration to practise here for one reason or another. Most of us will have had the experience of a highly qualified health professional coming to our clinics to say he or she cannot get over a particular hurdle even though he or she has something to contribute. It may not be the fault of the Medical Council — there may be other reasons. It is an aspect of the registration of health professionals that we need to keep in mind now that we are living in this new Ireland with the new Irish. The multi cultural basis of much of our health and social care service is something of which we need to be aware. Generally speaking, it is something I welcome. It is wonderful to see people coming here providing us with the expertise. Irish people, particularly in the nursing profession, return the compliment. However, we need to ensure standards are maintained, registration is in place and people are not disadvantaged or exploited because they were not born and reared here.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">This is a good, practical step forward. It is certainly a slow step in that we have been waiting a long time for it. However, generally speaking, there is support in this House for this type of regulation and registration. However, it places a responsibility on this Government. I go back to the point I made earlier about Government appointments. We need to see a serious commitment to ensuring best practice and the highest standards and that applies to Ministers, how they make appointments and how they live up to their obligations. Regrettably in the Department of Health and Children in particular there are serious questions about Ministers' lack of responsibilities and the resultant cost to the taxpayer, which was of enormous proportions. I hope in this instance, we will see legislation that will be of benefit not only to taxpayers but, specifically, to people who avail of services. People should be confident that they will get a good service from a competent, registered practitioner and that if something goes wrong — inevitably things go wrong but I hope they will go wrong with less frequency when this legislation is in place — proper recourse and safeguards are in place.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_723">I wish to share time with Deputy Catherine Murphy. I welcome the publication of this legislation of which there are a number of aspects I wish to address. We have waited for this Bill for some time. We also await similar legislation in other branches, such as the medical practitioners Bill for which the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children has asked repeatedly and which has been called for in this House. Legislation for which I have called repeatedly concerns the area of complementary and alternative medicine. Unfortunately, there is a number of charlatans operating in this area who have given the area of complementary and alternative medicine a bad name. Some tragic cases have emerged where people have been robbed of their money. These were people suffering from terminal cancer who were looking for a cure and were only too happy to dispense with their money. They were ripped off and treated in an appalling way. I will not mention the specific cases; we know them.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">People practising in this area have asked again and again for regulation. A committee has met in this regard, of which the Tánaiste is aware. Under the then Minister, Deputy Martin, a group was set up under Terry Garvey to examine this area to enable it to be properly regulated. Practitioners operating in this area want and have sought regulation to enable members of the public to have confidence in their work. We are talking of therapies ranging from aromatherapy to shiatsu and others which have been recognised as having enormous benefits. The benefits of holistic medicine are there to be seen but it requires legislation. People need to know they have some redress.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">In this legislation we are giving the client some means of redress. However, like the previous speaker, I have concerns about appointments to a plethora of boards that will now emerge. The Opposition has concerns about perceived patronage in terms of the way these appointments can be handed out. I am not sure what remuneration applies to these positions. I suppose it is a nice way of assisting the party faithful in many cases and such appointments are handed out. There must be greater transparency and accountability in the way these appointments are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Much of the discussion on this Bill in the Seanad and in this House centred on the distinction, or lack of it, between physical therapists and physiotherapists. I listened to what Deputy McManus said on this. It must be acknowledged on the floor of the House that we have been lobbied by physiotherapists and physical therapists. It seems to be a case of claim and counter claim. It is important to record all the available information.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">This Bill proposes to register by statute 12 named health care professions, including physiotherapy. Physiotherapists are asking to be allowed to protect for their exclusive use the title "physical therapy" in addition to "physiotherapy". The Institute of Physical Therapy and the Irish Association of Physical Therapists are resisting this because they believe it will undermine their existence as a competitor in the provision of physio-therapeutic health care. Physiotherapy and physical therapy have operated successfully here for the past 15 years as distinct entities with distinct training courses, professional representative associations, treatment approaches, functions, scopes of practice and opportunities for employment. Legislation restricting practise might conflict with the constitutional rights of physical therapists to earn a living. This is their concern as the Minister of State is probably aware. The effective loss of the entire physical therapy profession would eliminate competition and restrict the choice of patients without offering them any guarantee of an improved quality of service.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The Bacon report of 2001 advocates the recruitment of physical therapists to hospitals to alleviate an agreed and existing shortage. The removal of up to 350 physical therapists from the health service would worsen this situation for many decades according to the physical therapists.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">Irish physiotherapists claim the titles "physiotherapists" and "physical therapist" are interchangeable, yet there has been a clear differentiation between the two separate groups here for the past 15 years. "Physical therapy" and "physiotherapy" are generic titles and should not both be available to one group to own. Appropriation of two titles by one group facilitates regulatory capture. Although physiotherapists argue that internationally physiotherapy is exactly the same as physical therapy, they do not recognise physical therapists from many English speaking countries such as the United States and the Philippines.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The qualification awarded by the Institute of Physical Therapy in Ireland is recognised at home and abroad for the purposes of academic progression and access to master programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The Competition Authority argues that auxiliary professions, such as physical therapy, should be free to emerge which, it says, would not happen in the event of such regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">Deputy McManus quoted from what was stated by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists in its position paper. It stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_733">Members of the public often contact the ISCP office to find out why their physical therapy fees have not been reimbursed by VHI or BUPA only to discover that the practitioner they attended was not a physiotherapist. The confusion in the public eye surrounding the two practices is constantly being reinforced to our members through their contact with members of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">There is a rebuttal to that by the physical therapists. They state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_735">This is nothing more than hearsay. Both VHI and BUPA have officially confirmed ... [this was in November 2004] that they have no record of any such claims for reimbursement being made — proof that physical therapists explain the nature of the care and profession fully to their patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">To return to what Deputy McManus said on this matter, the ISCP commissioned a Millward Brown IMS poll. The idea was to find out whether people knew the difference between a physiotherapist and a physical therapist. The results showed that only one in three people surveyed knew that difference. The point was made as to whether people know the difference between a certified accountant and a chartered accountant or a podiatrist and chiropodist. I confess that in many cases I do not know the difference between all these professionals. Such confusion exists which I fully recognise.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">With these differences having emerged over the past 15 years, we face the problem of how we should deal with this issue. We could consider a number of means. I do not know if changing names is possible. The potential for confusion could be minimised by the Irish Association of Physical Therapists and the Irish Society for Chartered Physiotherapists obliging their members to explain their agreed differences between physical therapy and physiotherapy to potential clients at their first consultation. It should be part of the legislation that the differences are made clear. This is what both branches of the professions would like to happen. It is clear that the professional qualifications required for physiotherapy are much higher than for physical therapy. I understand why physiotherapists might feel aggrieved that practitioners are coming in from the side and taking some of their business and that confusion has grown because they have acquired the name physical therapists. It is up to us for the sake of the patient to ensure the differences are clarified. It would not help to have one title for both therapies because there is no question but they are different. An amendment to this effect will be tabled on Committee Stage by Green Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">As to the fees that can be claimed and reclaimed, members of the public can reclaim physiotherapy fees from the VHI and BUPA has said the position is under review.</p>

          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_739">Generally I welcome the Bill. Much discussion has taken place in the public arena about regulation and the term "nanny State" has been used. Clearly that has to do with regulation of personal behaviour. If anything there has been under-regulation of professions, organisations and institutions. There is much catching up to be done and this Bill attempts to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">I have been contacted about this matter by physiotherapists. While I do not wish to repeat the points made by previous speakers, there is a substantial difference between the two disciplines. It is obvious they have co-existed, albeit in different areas of specialty. A four-year degree course is required for one discipline while for the other discipline, according to the documentation, the course ranges from a part-time 40 weekend course to short distance learning without any clinical practice. Clearly there is a difference in the level of qualification required and what they do is quite different.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">The Bill is intended to protect the public. The area about which I would be concerned is the confusion among the public in regard to the service they are getting. One in two in the over 65 age group said they did not know the difference between the two disciplines. That is a gigantic level of confusion and it cannot be ignored. In the younger age group the level of confusion is one in three. Very often these are people who are vulnerable. Often those over 55 take a professional qualification as an absolute guarantee of the service in which they are engaging. It is important the Bill regulates that area. That issue needs to be addressed during other Stages of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The Bill draws attention to the fact that this is not the only area that requires regulation. Some ten or 12 areas are listed as requiring regulation while others are not listed — almost everyone can think of areas that are not listed. Given that it has taken a long time for the Bill to get to this stage it is fair to say the list is not complete. The longer the timeframe without regulation the more professions appear to emerge.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">It is in the interest of the profession to maintain good professional standards but I am not certain that self-enforcement achieves that aim. One would imagine there would be a vested interest in maintaining good standards. There are plenty of examples where good standards have not resulted from self-enforcement. I will be interested to see what happens on Committee Stage in terms of adding to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">There are others who operate in the social care area who are not included in the Bill but should be included. The public is entitled to and has an expectation that it will be protected. There is much in the Bill that is good from that point of view. For example, the Bill makes it an offence to use the title of any registered practitioner as set out in the Act or as prescribed by regulation, and that is worthwhile. The problem is that if some professions are excluded it almost makes it worse for them. That is the reason the list needs to be complete as it provides some comfort and protection to the public. It is important also that standards are not just set but maintained. I would welcome the inclusion of education and training and discipline, albeit with the proviso that I am not an absolute fan of the mechanism of self-enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">A plethora of people practise in the health care area in complementary and alternative medicine, some of whom provide services which people swear by and consider them wonderful. There are others who are chancers and prey on the vulnerable. It is important that issue is addressed and obviously regulation and legislation is needed. Sometimes people turn to complementary medicine and they need protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">I am concerned about the perception of legislation such as this, worthwhile as it is. There is a perception that if one regulates for something, the service is there to be regulated. In many of the areas that will be regulated there will be those who will work in private practice. Similarly, there will be those who work for agencies such as the Health Service Executive. The expectation is that if one regulates for speech therapists, there are speech therapists. I can speak only of the experience in Kildare and I am fortunate that it will be readily understood by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power, who is present, given that we share the same region in terms of the Health Service Executive. The reality is that there are no speech therapists in the Kildare area, particularly for people with intellectual disabilities, even though that area was part of the old Eastern Regional Health Authority. The position is different in Dublin which is within the same Health Service Executive region.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">It is fair for the public to ask if this regulation is an academic exercise and what use are regulations if a person has a child who requires speech therapy at a critical time and the service is not available, irrespective of whether it is regulated. A number of other professions are listed which fall within the same category. While the Bill is important it will create a perception that there will be movement on the services provided. There could be disappointment that this is an academic exercise for many who cannot avail of those services that are being regulated. I avail of this opportunity to make that point and use Kildare as the example.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_296">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_748">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. There must be proper availability of professionals in the health service no matter what kind of register is in place. The ruination of the health service has been the lack of professionals needed to do the job adequately. The capacity in hospitals must be improved and there must be proper development of primary health care to ensure the people of this island have a proper health service. The news today is that Professor Drumm has finally agreed to take on the job. I wish him well. As someone working in the health service, I have no doubt Professor Drumm will have a very good indepth knowledge of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The Medical Council registers medical practitioners. As a GP I am registered with the council and I pay my subscription and health insurance. However, this Bill does not take into account the alternative medicine practitioners. I have spoken in the House on a number of occasions about the disgraceful situation in my locality. A lady whom I call a killer continues to practice unfettered. If I do something wrong I am liable to be struck off the medical register and I am insured so that my patients can sue me. This practitioner whom I call a killer as I did before, is still carrying out her trade and already two people have died through her utter negligence of their situation and the utter failure of the system to protect vulnerable people. This Bill does nothing to address this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">The Government has considered this for several years by means of a working group but I do not know what they are working at. It is clear there needs to be a proper recognition of the problems. Certain people are not subject to the laws of the land and not even subject to the Coroner's Court. They have been summoned on two occasions to the Coroner's Court. The coroner investigated the case of the death of a young man who left a wife and family. This woman is practising in my area, seeing children with various illnesses and giving them placebo drugs which are useless, homoeopathic type drugs, which after analysis by the State chemical laboratory have been proved to be just sugar. This continues and I regret the Bill does not address this disgraceful situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Nor will this Bill do anything for the people waiting for speech therapy and different types of services because the professionals are not available. This Bill will do nothing about the embargo the Government will deny exists. That embargo exists. The people who are needed such as the speech therapists, nurses and the consultants will not be hired because of the ceiling on recruitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">I am familiar with the case of a man awaiting urology services who would be well capable of doing a day's work, but he cannot do anything because he must put up with the discomfort of a tube that he must carry with him day and night. That man must wait in the queue for urology services and compete with people who have been waiting since 1998 because such is the waiting time for urology services. The national treatment purchase fund is of no use to him because his problem had an acute onset. A 20-minute operation would sort this man's problem. He needs professional help but this Bill has nothing to offer him.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">When will this man receive treatment? If I make inquiries I will be told he will be waiting for five years. Must this man carry a bag around with him for five years? Chemical analysis shows that he is pre-cancerous and if he is to wait any longer he will probably develop cancer. He may well not survive the cancer. I have seen many men who will not survive, whose life expectancy has been shortened and who will die an early death purely because they have been left on this urology list.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The answer is not to put services into the bigger hospitals and I hope Professor Drumm gets my message. The answer is to support the local services. When people criticise the Hanly report and its recommendation for centralisation, which is just the Fitzgerald report under another name, the Government asks if they have an alternative. The alternative is to support the local services and hospitals. Where there are consultants in Mayo General Hospital there are little or no waiting lists. Where there are no consultants the lists stretch back to 1998, which is a scandal. A urologist in Mayo General Hospital would enable that man to be treated and he would not have to endure many years of discomfort. He has to get up seven or eight times at night. This is something that happens to older men in particular but this is a younger man who should not be in this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">There are many actions the Government could take to provide services at local level. Twelve trolleys are in use in Mayo General Hospital today because there are no available beds. Some people have been waiting up to five days on trolleys. I visited the accident and emergency department in Castlebar the other day. A 90-year old man was on a trolley with tears in his eyes. I asked him what the matter was. He said he was not feeling at all well and that it was his birthday that day. A young man had chest pains and should probably be treated in the intensive care unit but he was also on a trolley. Trolleys and people were everywhere. How could the staff do their work properly when there was not sufficient room even for them to move around, never mind treat a patient? The resuscitation room for use following serious traffic accidents is jammed full of people. I wonder what would happen in an emergency. The staff would not be able to cope. I am all in favour of the registration of professionals but the professionals should be there in the first place to allow them to be registered. I hope the Government will examine this situation in Mayo General Hospital, which is like Dante's "Inferno", pure hell, pure terror, pure chaos for people who have to deal with it. I pay tribute to the nurses and doctors working under very difficult conditions. I hope the Government gives them the support they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">How is it possible to support people at home if the facilities are not provided? I refer to centres and homes for older people. When people need to convalesce they cannot return to their area because there is no place for them to go. I know of one situation in Ballinrobe where the land has been bought for many years. In County Mayo we are waiting for completion of the design stage of a home for older people in Ballinrobe, which would cost approximately €200,000. This is not a great deal of money but the centre would give people hope for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Many current difficult situations could be easily sorted out. Proof that health apartheid exists is demonstrated in that people have been forced to march to Dublin to lobby for BreastCheck services for the south and west. There is much in this Bill but it should contain much more.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Mr. Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_758">With the permission of the House, I wish to share time with my colleague, Deputy Devins.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The statutory registration of health care professionals is a necessary and welcome development from all points of view. It will benefit practitioners and the general public alike. I wish to respond to a point made by Deputy Catherine Murphy in her contribution with which I agree. The registration is but one aspect of this matter and I had intended returning to it during my remarks and I hope to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">Apart from registration, which is acutely important, yesterday's High Court judgment regarding autism highlights the need for ceilings to be lifted in the numbers of occupational and speech therapists being trained. Even more urgent is the need for relevant sectors to talk to each other. Independently the education and health sectors do significant work. However, Deputy Catherine Murphy has outlined the situation in Kildare and the same applies in my area. While there is considerable goodwill to provide services for children with autism it is proving quite intractable to get coherence in the provision of services between the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children. Even with the enactment of the Bill we urgently need protocols so that what happened in the High Court yesterday does not continue to occur. Significant numbers of children with conditions across the autism spectrum are in need of support and the sooner those protocols are put in place the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The statutory registration will give recognition by an authorised body to all members of the relevant sectors and pronounce them as competent to practise within that line of work. By placing registration of the listed professions on a statutory footing, the Bill will give these professions the commendation they deserve. At present, only a handful of health care staff are subject to statutory regulation, including doctors, nurses, dentists, opticians and pharmacists. This new system will regulate the activities of a further 12 separate professions involving more than 11,500 people in the public sector and thousands more in the private sector. While I support the Bill as published, I take this opportunity to show how this may guide and direct us as we tackle some of the more contentious areas of the health care sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">The legislative framework before us will allow for the appraisal and approval of education and training courses, examinations, qualifications and institutions, and ensuring the proper and timely development of education and training facilities. Improving quality in the health care system requires implementation of internationally recognised and evidence-based guidelines and protocols, and ongoing education and commitment from health care institutions and professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">An example of the need for coherence is in the service delivered by chiropodists. At least two organisations represent chiropodists with two avenues for qualification. In Dublin it is proving very difficult for medical card holders, particularly older ones, to get chiropody services. It is now common for chiropodists to charge a top-up fee of up to €15 in addition to the GMS fee paid by the Health Service Executive. Despite my attempts and those of many colleagues in the House to raise the matter in various ways, all I have ascertained from parliamentary questions is that the Department of Health and Children wrote to the HSE in January reminding it of its obligations in this area. While it may be a small and niggling matter in the context of the overall budget and service delivery of the Department of Health and Children, to the recipients of that service it is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">While I congratulate the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children on the proposal, I call on her to consider the number of college and training places compared with demand in these areas. For example, when I see that psychologists, social workers and social care workers are included on this list, the first thing that comes to mind is the dire need for increased staff and services for adolescents, particularly in counselling services, and for families, particularly in family conferencing facilities. When we consider the level of adolescent suicide or the increase in anti-social behaviour, this regulation should aim to improve services in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">I again reiterate the urgency of providing greater numbers of places for those who wish to train as occupational and speech therapists. I also highlight the significant lack of provision of psychiatric services for adolescents, which is completely inadequate and needs to be addressed. We also need to address the issue of psychiatry for older people. The referral procedures are extraordinarily complicated. While I am sure these are appropriate and ethical, I know of a reclusive couple who everybody recognises are in need of psychiatric intervention. However, because no general practitioner referral has been made, the consultant psychiatrist for the HSE is not prepared to intervene in their case. These people live in appalling conditions. I have rarely if ever come across anything like it before. It is incumbent on the HSE to be able to direct professionals to intervene in serious cases of abject neglect such as this one.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">I appeal to the Tánaiste the urge these new bodies to increase both the number of courses that give recognition to these professions and the number of courses that are approved to remove the cap on numbers taking these subjects. The legislation also allows for greater consistency in the application of EU directives concerned with the mutual recognition of third level qualifications. I know this has caused disruption in many of these professions and in many more. Therefore, by including it in this legislation, it will inform how best we can go about such recognition in other areas. While the mutual recognition of qualifications has been addressed reasonably well in the education profession, it has been dealt with unsatisfactorily in many others and some significant gaps need to be filled.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">As outlined in the 2001 health strategy, gaining people's trust in a health system is about guaranteeing quality. Statutory registration such as this is in line with this goal as it guarantees that people receive proper treatment when they enter a particular practice. People want to know the service they receive meets approved and certified standards. This system will ease their legitimate concerns that they are visiting health professionals who are properly trained and competent to look after their ailments or injuries. Extending this statutory registration to other professions will increase the trust the public has in our health care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The Bill is also good for the professionals as regulation will protect their good name and reputation and allow them to stand over their titles. Established professionals are not afraid of being part of a regulatory system whereby they must uphold standards because that is what is meant by being a professional. Many realise that the good name and reputation of the majority can be damaged by the actions of a very small minority and that a profession can be brought into disrepute without a mechanism for sanctioning professional misconduct and misdemeanour. In this way, the Bill gives the professionals and the public protection from those working in specific health areas without any proper qualifications and from those who provide substandard or questionable services.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">Extending this system to other areas will provide the same protection. For example, we are all aware of the tragic death of a Limerick woman earlier this year following plastic surgery in New York at the hands of someone who was under investigation for negligence at that time. We all want to ensure that such tragedies are prevented and, by ensuring that all major health care professions are adequately trained and regulated, we can achieve this. I also note what Deputy Cowley said about people in the non-medical area.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">A proper registration system gives the public and the professions increased protection because it allows for the investigation of allegations of misconduct or incompetence. Any complaints can be followed up and rectified and in an extreme case a person's name can be erased from the register.</p>

        <b>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</b>

          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism" eId="spk_298">
            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_772">Legal proceedings have been taken by Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited in the commercial court against Dublin Waterworld for breaches of the lease on the National Aquatic Centre. As this issue relates to proceedings before the commercial court at present, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment or statement on these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">However, I take this opportunity to indicate my disappointment that Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited has been left with no option but to instigate these proceedings to ensure compliance with the obligations of the lease on the National Aquatic Centre. I had no part in the awarding of the contract for the operation of the National Aquatic Centre, the contract for which was placed prior to my appointment as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. The awarding authority was CSID and the contract was signed early in 2002. The award of the contract for the National Aquatic Centre was the subject of an investigation by the Attorney General in March 2002 and the report was discussed at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts during that month. However, as soon as it was brought to my attention that the lease obligations were not being fulfilled, I decided that legal proceedings should be initiated and fully support the course of action taken by CSID in my role as shareholder of the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">In developing the National Aquatic Centre at Abbotstown, the State undertook a very worthwhile and necessary investment. The capital expenditure of €62 million excluding VAT on the provision of the facility represents money very well spent. In addition, €3 million was spent on the original sports campus project on site preparation and surveys of the land at Abbotstown. This work has already proved very useful in the preparation of a development control plan for the site and will be further drawn upon when work on the wider campus concept begins. This is the total capital sum spent in connection with the development of the sporting facilities at Abbotstown. The notion that €200 million was wasted is simply nonsense. The National Aquatic Centre has been fully operational since 20 May when extensive repair work to the roof was completed, following the storm damage that occurred on 1 January 2005.</p>

            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_775">What lease obligations were not fulfilled by Dublin Waterworld? How did the €10 million VAT liability arise? Why does Dublin Waterworld have to pay this liability? Is the Minister satisfied this VAT was owed?</p>
            <p eId="para_776">One of the reasons Dublin Waterworld refused to pay rent was because it claimed the building was defective. It has forwarded a number of defects in the building to Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited. The company had sought in the past to have these defects corrected and it refused to pay rent until the issue was resolved. The rent money was held in a fund and now some of this money is being paid. Can the Minister clarify that the building was defective in some aspects? Who supervised the design and construction of the centre on behalf of the Government? Who signed off on the design and construction of the roof on behalf of the Government? The judge in the case made reference to Dublin Waterworld not being a substantial company. Why did CSID sign a contract with such a company at that time? Did Dublin Waterworld fulfil all the criteria? Were the proper procedures followed through? It seems Dublin Waterworld won the competition set out by the Department.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_777">I am limited in what I can say because there are matters before the commercial court. I am advised that it would be inappropriate to make any comment which might prejudice the outcome of a matter which is <i>sub judice</i>. CSID has instituted proceedings against Dublin Waterworld Limited, which is due to the failure of Dublin Waterworld to fulfil fundamental obligations of its lease. These have included the failure to pay rent and insurance, failure to provide audited accounts, failure to provide to establish a sinking fund, failure to agree a capital maintenance programme, as well as failure to discharge a VAT bill on the lease of over €10 million. Following repeated requests for payment, CSID began legal action against Dublin Waterworld to seek redress.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">There is a sum of €10, 254,600 due on the grant of the lease. The issue has been referred by the court to Mr. Dermot O'Brien, deputy president of the Institute for Taxation, for arbitration under clause 10 of the lease. My view on the repair work is that the taxpayer should not be asked to foot the bill for any repairs carried out to the National Aquatic Centre. These are issues of liability between various parties. The Government rejects any liability for damage to the aquatic centre. All of these issues must be resolved in proceedings which are taking place in different fora.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">The usual contracting parties normally find that differences arise in the interpretation of contracts and these issues are resolved by the courts or by arbitration. I await the outcome of the proceedings and I have little else to add.</p>

            <p eId="para_783">I have no statutory responsibility for the Abbey, which is operated by the National Theatre Society Limited, a private company limited by guarantee. My Department maintains liaison with the Abbey at various levels, and I have been briefed on recent developments regarding the theatre's finances and financial accounts. State subvention to the Abbey is provided by the Arts Council, which is a statutory agency under the aegis of my Department, independent in the disbursement of its funds under the provisions of the Arts Act 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">The Abbey is a key part of Ireland's cultural fabric, and it is imperative that it be placed on a sustainable basis for the future. This was the background to the decision of the Arts Council late last year to allocate an additional €2 million to the theatre. The release of this funding was conditional on the implementation by the Abbey of a wide-ranging change management programme as agreed with the council. Good progress is being made on many fronts with the delivery of this programme. I was very disappointed to hear last month of the shortcomings in the Abbey's financial management system to which the Deputy referred in his question and on which my Department was given a courtesy briefing by the chairman of the board of the theatre and the Arts Council. I welcome the decision of the board of the theatre to engage independent financial expertise to carry out a root and branch evaluation of the Abbey's finances. I understand a report should be available by the end of the month. The report will be discussed with the Arts Council and appropriate corrective action will then be taken.</p>

            <p eId="para_785">Does the Minister agree that, in its centenary year, the national theatre, which was the theatre of Yeats, Synge, O'Casey and Lady Gregory, got into a very sad state? Has a decision been reached on the restructuring of the Abbey's governance structures, which the Minister described as Victorian in character? Does the Minister propose to make changes to the Arts Council's role in funding the Abbey Theatre? He was quoted as considering direct funding of the theatre rather than its funding through the council. Does the Minister intend his Department will play a more hands-on role on the monitoring of the theatre's finances?</p>
            <p eId="para_786">I take it the report to which the Minister referred is that which was presented as the report of an independent consultant charged to consider why there was such an overrun from touring plays which travelled internally and to the USA and Australia last year.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_787">I confirm that I described the governance arrangements at the Abbey as Victorian. The theatre is owned and operated by the National Theatre Society Limited, a private company limited by share capital whose shareholders are the nine members of the board of directors and no fewer than 23 others who are now collectively termed the advisory council. The term "shareholder" when used publicly refers generally to advisory council members, which is to say those shareholders who are not members of the board. The shares issued are purely nominal and have no economic value.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">It is necessary to change the governance which obtains at the Abbey, in which context I await recommendations from the Arts Council. I am very conscious of the need to retain the independence of the Abbey in the context of its artistic contribution and have no wish to interfere with a heavy hand. While I considered direct funding of the theatre in the aftermath of the discovery of an increased deficit, on further consideration and in the final analysis it is probably best for the Arts Council to continue to fund the Abbey. The council has greater discretion in the funding it can provide from time to time. With the independence of the theatre in terms of its artistic contribution to the forefront of my mind, I consider that the arms-length principle should be retained.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">Future governance arrangements will be brought before the Government after discussions have been completed between the Arts Council and me and it is anticipated there will be change. I hope it is change everyone accepts for the better. Having given a great deal of consideration to future practice in the keeping of accounts, rather than become directly involved in the funding of the Abbey, it would be better to appoint an officer of the Department to the finance committee of the national theatre to ensure there is no recurrence of previous events.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">I am very disappointed at what happened, which did not represent the most professional accounting performance I have witnessed. I have no doubt, having had dealings with them, that the two gentlemen who have departed operated in good faith at all times. Unfortunately, there were errors in the theatre's accounts which came to light.</p>

            <p eId="para_791">While I understand the Minister's points, it is difficult to understand how a shortfall of almost €1 million created by the tours of seven cities and towns in Ireland last June and July, Australia in September and America in October did not come to light until May 2005. The systems in place must be appalling to say the least to allow that to happen. While I have no doubt the Minister is right that the people at the Abbey acted with the greatest honesty and integrity, it is incredible how such a substantial shortfall could go undetected, especially when the finance and audit committee met more than monthly during 2004.</p>

            <p eId="para_792">I agree fully with Deputy O'Shea's observations. I cannot defend the errors, nor do I seek to do so. My aim is to ensure there is no recurrence of such errors and I feel sure that in placing an official of my Department on the finance committee I am making a positive contribution. In addition, we have asked consultants to examine the procedures which were extant at the Abbey with a view to amending accounting practices. I assure the Deputy that things will be done more professionally in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_794">The national lottery-funded sports capital programme administered by my Department allocates funding to sporting, voluntary and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis. Applications for funding under the 2005 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 5 and 6 December last and the closing date for their receipt was 4 February 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">A total of 1,362 applications were received before the deadline, including one from the organisation in question, all of which are being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria. The criteria are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce grant allocations under the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_796">While I thank the Minister for his reply, I had hoped for a more specific answer. I accept he is still reviewing the applications. Ballycroy is a Mayo village which has suffered very heavily from depopulation to the extent that it has lost half of its people over the years. The community is fighting hard to come back and has done trojan work to reclaim from a bog a sports pitch that has been rolled and seeded. The community is a great tribute to the country. The work needs to be completed and while the community has done its best to raise funds, further help is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">Essential off-pitch facilities require plumbing for toilets and electrical and carpentry work. I will give the Minister an idea of how essential is the work. I attended the recent sad occasion of the death of the referee Mr. John Mulligan, to whose commitment to the GAA and hard work over the years I pay tribute. While Mr. Mulligan's passing was inevitable in the circumstances, it would have been better if the off-pitch facilities had been available to provide some privacy.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">I hope the Minister will look favourably on the application in question. There is one toilet at the field whereas seven are needed. All sports are played in the field and I hope the Minister will support people who have done their best.</p>

            <p eId="para_799">I remind Deputy Cowley that Ballycroy field management was allocated a grant of €30,000 under the 2002 sports capital programme to help fund the construction of a multi-purpose sports area, clubhouse and installation of floodlighting.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">The grant was fully paid early in 2004. It applied unsuccessfully under the 2004 programme and I understand it has made a new application under the 2005 programme which is or will be measured against the criteria in the Department and assessed. I understand the estimate of the cost of the new works is €99,600 and that the amount sought is €71,680.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_805">As I have previously informed the House on a number of occasions, I was authorised by Government to invite expressions of interest by way of public invitation from the private sector in participating, on the basis of a PPP, in the capital redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre in and-or around the vicinity of the site of the existing theatre. With successive proposals for redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre at its existing location, at the site of the former Carlton Cinema in O'Connell Street or on the former Coláiste Mhuire site in Parnell Square having to be ruled out for a variety of reasons, options for progressing the project were clearly narrowing.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">Against this background, I authorised negotiations with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in connection with its offer of a site for the theatre at George's Dock. The Office of Public Works engaged in detailed discussions with the DDDA over recent months to clarify issues around the availability of this site. These consultations have progressed to the point where I am in a position to say that a potentially suitable site at George's Dock capable of satisfying the accommodation brief for the Abbey Theatre is now on offer subject to clarification of some points of detail with the DDDA.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">My Department has been in contact with the chair of the board of the Abbey Theatre to seek confirmation of the detail of the accommodation brief preparatory to a submission to Government requesting formal approval to proceed with the redevelopment project at George's Dock.</p>

            <p eId="para_808">I welcome this significant and potentially historic announcement by the Minister. I hope it will not be a re-occurrence of the unfortunate announcement on Coláiste Mhuire. I recognise that this announcement is important. Like the Minister, I would have preferred if the Abbey Theatre could have been reconstructed on its current site or relocated to the Carlton site on O'Connell Street but that was not to be.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">Nevertheless, I consider George's Dock a fitting location for the new Abbey Theatre. It will be a landmark building that will make a statement about our nation and how we have progressed to this stage. It is right in the centre of the most vibrant and exciting part of the city and the country. It will make its own statement as regards the success of the Financial Services Centre over the years. It is an ideal location approximately 300 m from O'Connell Street and around the corner from the current location of the Abbey Theatre. I compliment the DDDA and thank it for offering this building to the nation. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that the site has been offered more or less free of charge. It is a welcome announcement that will be positively greeted by the arts community. We can ensure we will have a theatre that will compare with any theatre in the world, that we will have new governance over it, and that the Abbey Theatre can have proper funding in future.</p>

If the site is finally approved I would consider it an appropriate one for what is a great national cultural institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">I have said on many occasions in the past that while this generation of Irish people is among the most creative and imaginative we have ever had, there is no public architecture which gives expression to that same imagination and creativity.

         asked the

        if he will consider making a formal request to his British counterpart for the return of the documents that were removed from Dublin Castle in 1922.
        [20423/05]

          </question>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_316" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_813">In 1922, the departing British authorities removed considerable quantities of records from the Chief Secretary's Office in Dublin Castle to the Irish Office in London. While some of these records dated back to the mid-19th century, it is believed that most were concerned with the early 20th century. Unfortunately, it is understood that a large portion of the transferred records were destroyed as a health risk in the mid-1930s following the flooding of the basement in which they were held. Other records, including the Fenian papers, were returned to the State Paper Office in Dublin and are now held in the National Archives. Records remaining in England are now held among the records of the Colonial Office in the British National Archives at Kew, near London. Many of the most important of these records were published on microfilm in the 1990s. Copies of the microfilm publication are available in our National Archives in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">Prior to the development of modern information technology a strong case existed to seek the physical return of some of the records held at Kew. However, as it is increasingly the case that archival institutions worldwide are publishing their most important holdings in digital format, the physical location of the original material is not of as much relevance to historians and other researchers.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">The National Archives is currently engaged in a number of major digital publication projects and, once these are well advanced, has undertaken to investigate the possibility of a co-operative digital publication programme of the early 20th century records it holds from the former Chief Secretary's Office and those records held in the British National Archives. I will endeavour to facilitate such a co-operative programme.</p>

          <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_317">
            <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_816">The Minister has responsibility for the National Archives. There is also tourism potential for some of the material held as there would be long lists of records relating to the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">I accept the point that new methods of technology allow for material to be looked at in remote locations. I have come across fascinating information on going through most of the boxes in Kew. My interest was in family history. However, a significant amount of the material I encountered, some of which was confiscated, would not transfer well to microfilm or CD-ROM. Some of the material is quite amusing. Song books feature among seditious material. Some of the information and records would be considered low level.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">For a long time we were not in a position to request this material as there was not a normal relationship between the two countries. Now that the relationship has normalised, some of those records could usefully be returned. Does the Minister have any knowledge of the timeframe that Kew is working to in regard to microfilming or transferring these documents to an accessible format? The Public Record Office has an extensive and ongoing programme for First World War records.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">The British National Archives at Kew is working to its own timeframe. Does the Minister know the timeframe to which it is working in respect of the Irish records? If they are to be available in the format that has been specified, the timeframe will be important. An important anniversary will fall next year and in this regard the records would be quite useful to students of history. I am sure the history curriculum will reflect this and the primary source of information should be available to students who may well want to look at the relevant documents.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_820">I will inquire into the intentions of the British National Archives regarding this matter and find out what it has done. It is fair to say that prior to the development of modern technology, there was a very strong case for the return to Ireland of at least some of the records of the chief secretary's office now held in the British National Archives at Kew, although this was always likely to have been resisted by the British authorities, mainly because they would have felt it would set a precedent setting in train requests for the return of records from many other British colonies that obtained independence in the mid-20th century. If I may put it as kindly as possible, there may have been what I would describe as a run on the cultural bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">It is increasingly the case that archival institutions across the world are publishing their most important holdings in digital format, either on CD-ROM or on the Internet. Once this is done, the location of original archives will be of very little importance to historians and other researchers. However, I appreciate Deputy Catherine Murphy's point that it is important that records be made available in the format she specified so people can have access to them. I will inquire whether this has been done in respect of the documents in question and, if not, when it will be done and how long it will take.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_319" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_824">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 14 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">I refer the Deputies to my detailed reply to Questions Nos. 89 and 114 on 10 May last about progress on the implementation of the two-year tourism action plan. The seven key barriers to tourism development highlighted by the tourism action plan implementation group in its most recent progress report centre on concerns about competitiveness, the rate of progress in the negotiation of an EU-US open skies arrangement, additional pier and terminal facilities at Dublin Airport, restoring growth from the British market, the absence of a national conference centre, continuing uncertainty about access to the countryside and significant gaps in Dublin's cultural infrastructure. Copies of the report are available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">There have been further developments on some of these issues since the group reported, such as Government approval of the aviation action plan on 18 May last, the submission of tenders by two consortia for the provision of a national conference centre in Dublin on 20 May and the appointment of the interim board of the National Consumer Agency on 6 June, which will ensure that the consumer agenda will be embedded more effectively in our current economic model.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">The implementation group will continue its activities over the remainder of the period of the initial two-year action plan and, later this year, will convene the second forum of the tourism industry, the outcome of which will inform its final report to me. Undoubtedly, the issue of competitiveness and value for money has been the Irish tourism industry's greatest challenge over recent years. I have spoken about this frequently since I took on the tourism portfolio.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">The survey referred to by the Deputy, which is neither scientific nor robust and does not include the price of access or accommodation, found that the prices of a limited number of goods were higher in Ireland than elsewhere. This does not come as any surprise. One can easily see how prices for these same goods can vary within Ireland itself. However, price and value for money are not the same. Ireland has never been promoted as a cheap holiday destination but has in the past compared well in terms of value for money when measured against other locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">The Irish tourism industry has been working hard over the past two years or so to improve visitors' perception of value for money. Some concrete examples of its initiatives include the hundreds of special offers for overseas and domestic customers alike on the websites of the tourism agencies and the value deals offered by accommodation providers, tour operators and restaurants. Perhaps reflecting their efforts, Fáilte Ireland's visitor attitudes survey of 2004 found that in contrast with the trend of recent years, there was no deterioration over the previous year in the level of satisfaction among visitors about the cost of access, accommodation or tourism-specific services such as car hire.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">We need to recognise the positive response of the industry and to be careful in our use of language. Repetitive use of negative terminology, which tars everybody with the same brush, can undermine our efforts to market Ireland abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">I know I am not alone in believing it is hard to beat the Irish tourism experience. We should remember that 97% of overseas visitors surveyed last year said they would recommend Ireland as a holiday destination.</p>

            <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
            <p eId="para_832">Without engaging in party politics, I must state my party and I welcome the steps the Minister has been taking to deal with some of the key barriers to tourism. Some of the positive developments in the tourism sector over recent years testify to his work. However, in leaner times, given the rise in oil prices and the fact that other cheaper destinations are beginning to market their unique selling points more aggressively, we can no longer afford to rest on our laurels and we need to do a little extra.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">What will the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, as opposed to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, do about the policy vacuum in respect of access to the countryside, given that there has been a consistent decline in those taking walking holidays? This is a key area.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">Concerns have been expressed about a lack of proper product development and innovation and also about the regional spread of tourism. I am still concerned that the midlands and south east are not getting the same crack of the whip as the western region.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_835">I thank Deputy Gogarty for his comments. I appreciate the constructive manner in which he approaches questions on tourism. Walkways are the responsibility of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs because they are connected to rural development. He set up Comhairle na Tuaithe which it was hoped would resolve outstanding issues between landowners and the tourism industry. We have lost share in terms of walkers entering the country because not all our walkways are open. I appeal to all landowners to whom this applies to co-operate because it is in the interest of everybody.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">We have had a very sophisticated product development model in operation for some time. Some €50 million was allocated to the independent board dealing with applications and €12 million has been re-advertised and sanctioned and has yet to be allocated. The applications have arrived in the Department and are being evaluated to improve the tourism product further.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">I am concerned about the regional spread of tourism. Although numbers have increased considerably, unfortunately the regional spread that obtained in the past is no longer evident. Accordingly, we have changed the marketing strategy pertaining to all our markets with a view to promoting the regions. For example, if a region has access to a given city or cities in Britain or elsewhere, we try to concentrate marketing of that region in that city or cities. Other such measures are being taken and, with a view to helping the regions, I intend to bring substantive proposals on regional tourism authorities to Government in the very near future.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_838">I take the Minister's point as regards highlighting the negative in respect of any aspect of the country's life. However, we should not close our eyes to negative developments that can lead to a deterioration in any particular area. Here we are talking about tourism. As regards the particular survey that was the subject of Question No. 14, I know the Minister said it did not deal with accommodation. When we see, however, that the cost of holidaying in Ireland went up by 26% last year as against a decrease of 20% in the US, and an item such as film costing €6.20 here compared to €1 in South Africa, it is something that should give us pause for thought.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">One of the important areas where we are losing out is as regards the English motorist. Since duty-free was abolished, there is very little attraction in coming to Ireland that way. It was pointed out at our committee last week, however, that Irish tourists going to France can purchase wine and bring it back here duty-free. Has the Minister or his colleague, the Minister for Finance, been reviewing any initiatives to make it more attractive for motorists to come here on car ferries? Essentially, is the Minister saying there is not a real problem in terms of the tourism cost base in Ireland? Is he dismissing completely the figures revealed in the survey that is the subject of Question No. 14?</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_840">I am not dismissing the figures, but they relate to specific goods so the survey could not possibly be an accurate reflection of the average cost. Some 97% of visitors to the country have stated they would recommend Ireland to a friend, which is very encouraging. I am not denying Deputy O'Shea's contention that there is a competitiveness issue. Of course there is and I am the first to acknowledge it. I agree there is no point in burying one's head in the sand, although emotive terms as regards our competitiveness are no help to the tourism industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">As regards motorists from Britain, we would very much like to attract more because, as mentioned earlier, they go to the regions. As I indicated, a major campaign is taking place in our main markets and in particular in Britain. Only this week I launched a campaign for the tourism authorities in the west, north west and Shannon Development, which encourages people to go west. We also conducted one of the most comprehensive surveys ever undertaken on the British market last year to see how we could improve our marketing. We have done that across all sectors, and I have no doubt this will impact on the motorist as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_842">On the issue of key barriers to tourism development, does the Minister share my concerns and those of many people, about the high cost for tourists when they visit the island? Has the impact of the smoking ban led to a decrease in the numbers visiting Ireland? I have been talking to a number of tourists from Spain and Portugal who assert the potential to lose between 20% and 25% of the European market exists because of the smoking ban.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">Will the Minister say whether it is unacceptable to have tourists and Irish citizens standing in the rain having a cigarette and a drink? Finally, as regards the 97% of tourists who are satisfied, that is a particularly high figure. Who did the survey and what type of questions were asked?</p>

Is there a national programme in place to improve signposting, especially in this city where signposts were erected and taken down? People are very confused when they come to Dublin, especially if they are driving——</p>

            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_846">Dingle is another question. The signs have not yet been changed, but people are getting lost. Also, the Luas, while it is welcome, is creating problems around St. Stephen's Green, for example, which is a focal point for motorists if they are going to the northside of the city. I met a group of French tourists outside the Dáil the other day who were totally confused. They had been travelling around town for about an hour. They were simply trying to get to the northside and they could not get there. The Minister might update the House as to what is happening with signposts, because this was one of the key recommendations of the tourism policy group.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">Perhaps the Minister would also address the whole cohesion question as regards Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland. There are concerns in the tourism industry that there is no real cohesion between the two agencies. It is said that one agency is selling the whole island and that Fáilte Ireland's role is restricted.</p>

            <p eId="para_848">On the smoking ban, as mentioned by Deputy Finian McGrath, this is not a negative factor at all. In fact the indications coming back are that it is positive. Far from people recoiling from the country as regards this issue, Ireland has set a precedent for other countries, which will all be following in due course.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_850">These are the indications. We carried out a survey before the introduction of the smoking ban in the American market, to find that it is a positive feature. As regards the question of competitiveness, I have outlined my position. Offering value for money to visitors is an issue. To be fair, the industry is responding well to the challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">Surveys are carried out on a regular basis by Fáilte Ireland. They are presented and I am rather taken aback that Deputy Finian McGrath should be surprised that 97% of visitors would recommend a holiday in Ireland to a friend. It does not surprise me in the slightest, having been in other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">As regards signposting, that is obviously a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. A highly ambitious programme was embarked upon in many counties. In County Kerry, at least, an excellent job was done in conjunction with Kerry County Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">Of course there is cohesion between Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland. Very often, for example, as regards the sports initiative, Tourism Ireland on the international stage is the agent for Fáilte Ireland. Fáilte Ireland's role is necessarily restricted as a result of the establishment of Tourism Ireland which has responsibility for marketing the whole island of Ireland on the international stage and is doing so with a tremendous degree of success.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">Visitor numbers are up overall. We certainly are at record levels. Visitor satisfaction levels are high, but surveys show there is an issue in particular as regards pricing when it comes to eating out, and also the price of drink. This affects Irish holidaymakers as well as visitors from abroad and everybody has to be extremely conscious of it. In the 2004 overseas visitor attitude survey, although satisfaction with overall value for money had not deteriorated further — it had levelled out — value for money was still the most critically rated aspect of the Irish holiday experience. I have no doubt about that.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_331" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_857">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 11 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">My Department has an excellent, long-standing and productive relationship with the Institute for Leisure and Amenity Management, ILAM Ireland, with regard to the network of high quality, appropriate and sustainable leisure sports facilities available throughout the country. My Department and ILAM have co-operated in various initiatives over the years to help promulgate standards of best practice pertaining to the provision, management and maintenance of sports and leisure facilities. Department officials have participated in numerous ILAM public seminars to consult, inform and assist local authorities, sports organisations, voluntary bodies and community organisations on details of Government sports policy and funding programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">Ministers have publicly endorsed ILAM's initiative in introducing the white flag awards aimed at swimming pools, sports halls, gymnasiums and other indoor leisure facilities in the public and private sectors. The awards have been welcomed and commended as an important instrument to promote the highest standards in facility management and maintenance to meet present day requirements and demands of an increasingly discerning public.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">I am also pleased to congratulate ILAM and An Taisce on this scheme and its success to date. However, as I have already indicated informally to ILAM, I cannot envisage any direct role which would be appropriate for my Department in what is essentially an internal leisure industry standard, adjudication on which would be outside the role, function and expertise of the Department. I will arrange to have this position conveyed formally to ILAM.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_332">
            <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
            <p eId="para_861">I thank the Minister for the final sentence of his reply. He will be aware that in March 2004 he met the chief executive officer of ILAM, Mr. Killian Fisher, who recalls that at the end of a 26 minute meeting, the Minister indicated he would give the discussion due consideration before getting back to ILAM. Is he aware of ILAM's concern that he did not do so, although this may have been an oversight on the part of his Department?</p>
            <p eId="para_862">Notwithstanding his comments on the lack of a direct involvement by his Department, will the Minister formally endorse the white flag system? The awards are no longer made by An Taisce, as I mistakenly indicated in my question. Given that leisure facilities are not subject to legislation or regulation, does the Minister intend in the near future to introduce legislation to regulate the sector? If so, will he use the opportunity to formalise the white flag awards? If not, will he categorically and formally endorse the awards and allow ILAM and the 11 organisations involved in the white flag jury to proceed with their important work of promoting good standards in leisure management?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_333" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_863">I am pleased to endorse the initiative ILAM has undertaken which I welcome and commend as an important instrument to promote the highest standards in facility management and maintenance to meet today's requirements. To that extent, the initiative is welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">As I stated, I indicated informally to ILAM that I did not envisage any direct role which would be appropriate for my Department in what is essentially an internal leisure industry standard. Given the level of regular contact and ongoing open communication between my Department and ILAM, it is worth noting that the latter has not pursued the question of the Department's closer involvement in the operation of the white flag scheme. This indicates that the Department's participation in the adjudication process is not a critical success factor for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">This is not, incidentally, an excuse for the Department's oversight in not writing formally to ILAM on the matter. However, it appears to provide an indicator that an internal industry scheme based on functions and criteria well outside the Department's remit and expertise should flourish without the involvement of a Department. For example, the blue flag awards do not have a direct input from the Department which does not have the level of expertise required to enable examinations and testing to take place or to benchmark against relevant criteria. Unfortunately, this is also true of indoor facilities.</p>

         asked the

         further to previous parliamentary questions, if an additional tranche of funding will be made available for swimming pools.

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_869">As I indicated in replies to similar parliamentary questions on the subject on 1 December 2004 and 17 February 2005, the local authority swimming pool programme administered by my Department has been closed to new applicants since 31 July 2000. Moneys provided under my Department's multi-annual capital envelope for the programme are being committed to completing projects being progressed under that programme. The financial provision for the programme in 2005 is €32 million, an 82% increase on the 2004 expenditure of €17.6 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">As no application was made by South Dublin County Council by the closing date of 31 July 2000, the current programme does not include the provision of a swimming pool for Lucan. My Department is carrying out an expenditure review of the programme which will assist in the formulation of future policy, including the question of the introduction of a new swimming pool programme. The review is expected to be completed later this year.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_337">
            <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
            <p eId="para_871">Given that the question was tabled primarily to elicit an update of the position, will the Minister give a definitive timeframe on how long it will take for additional funding to come on stream in the event that the review's recommendations in this regard are in the affirmative? How quickly would local authorities be able to apply for such funding? Would it, for example, be available in the lifetime of the Government?</p>
            <p eId="para_872">The Minister referred to the position with regard to Lucan, a matter I specifically raised on previous occasions. As he is aware, the town has a large population, far in excess of towns with a swimming pool such as Birr. Carlow will get two swimming pools whereas other rapidly growing urban areas, for example, Douglas in Deputy Boyle's constituency, lack swimming pools. If the outcome of the review is positive, will it be possible to make funding available within four months of the end of the year in order that local authorities can complete the process quickly and in the lifetime of the Government to avoid being caught up in pre-election posturing?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_338" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_873">God forbid that any of us should ever become involved in pre-election posturing. Priority must be given to the large number of swimming pools still being processed. It is not proposed to re-open the swimming pools programme at present. However, the question of doing so will be considered following an expenditure review of the programme being carried out by my Department and which is expected to be completed later this year. The review is examining issues such as how the programme has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to areas in which pools have been built and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">The current programme, under which 55 projects are being or will be dealt with, has been singularly successful. Local communities have benefited considerably. Twenty-five projects have been allocated grant aid, of which 15 have been completed. Construction work has been completed on two others which are due to open shortly and a further eight are under construction. Six projects are at tender stage, 15 at contract document stage and nine at preliminary report stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">There are 73 local authority pool facilities throughout the country, of which 63 are indoor and ten outdoor. Some, however, are open only on a seasonal basis or are not operational, with several having been closed for some time. I have no doubt a new programme will be required once we have substantially proceeded through the current programme. I sincerely hope this will take place during the course of my term as Minister or that of my successor.</p>

            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_876">If and when the Department is designing a new swimming pool programme, will consideration be given to including dry facilities such as gymnasia, sports facilities and crèches in swimming pool projects? Funding is currently restricted to wet facilities. It is important to have a broad range of facilities available within health and leisure complexes. Will the Minister consider including other elements as qualifying for funding?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_340" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_877">The maximum grant that can be allocated for a swimming pool is €3.8 million and this does not provide the dry facilities. The problem is that there are not enough resources to go around. When facilities are being put in place, local authorities must come up with funding and if they want dry facilities they must provide them themselves. The only other vehicle for dry facilities at present is the sports capital programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">One of the main difficulties I have experienced in the Department in recent years is that each year the demands on funds increase. This is not just due to inflation but to the fact that people's requirements are greater. Where a club was satisfied with £10,000 in 1990, today €100,000 would be the minimum demand and often clubs come looking for €1 million. The sports capital programme simply cannot sustain that sort of demand. In the same way the swimming pool programme cannot sustain the demand upon it. In any swimming pool programme that comes forward it must be ensured there is a co-operative arrangement whereby local authorities will bear a portion of the burden. Otherwise we will not be able to provide any facilities. It will not be possible for me or any future Minister to include the dry facilities with the swimming pool because of lack of resources.</p>

EU funding of €500,000 has been provided, the event has a sponsorship target of €3.975 million and Cork City Council is to provide €3.175 million. Cork City Council has also underwritten a further €3.175 million of Cork 2005's sponsorship target. This brings the total budget for Cork 2005 to €15.5 million All Government funding to Cork 2005 is channelled through Cork City Council. To date my Department has made payments totalling €6 million to Cork City Council in respect of Cork 2005 expenditure.

            <p eId="para_882">We have been generous in terms of Cork City of Culture. It is proving to be a wonderful success, despite forebodings which were vented in some quarters, not least in Cork. The organising committee has done a superb, professional job and the figures, which do not lie, bear that out. In the first three months of 2005, 300,000 people attended events under Cork City of Culture, an astounding figure. Visits to cultural institutions in Cork were up 30% across the city. The number of passengers coming in through Cork Airport is up by 25% on the same period last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">Cork City of Culture projects are now moving outdoors for the summer, with theatre and other activities that will ensure the participation of people across the city and beyond. Cork has done Ireland proud and while a review would not be appropriate now, when we look back on the year, we will be able to say that Cork did what it always does — its best — and that is usually good enough.</p>

            <p eId="para_885">The Cork City of Culture organisers knew precisely what the funding would be. Far from staying with the original figure, the Government increased its investment. Sponsorship and benefit in kind have exceeded €5.5 million and are heading for €6 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">It is true that when we make international comparisons with larger cities that have held the title of European City of Culture, Cork's budget is not as high but if we compare the spend per head of population the amount being spent in Cork is above the average. An event like this is not just about money, it is also about participation, community and involvement. The involvement that was anticipated and sought is happening and I am pleased about that. It should be remembered that this is a two-way track. It is not a question of Cork exhibiting its own cultural heritage, it is also about Europe doing likewise in Cork.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_891">In July 2004, the Irish Sports Council, in conjunction with the Olympic Council of Ireland and the Paralympic Council of Ireland, commissioned the Athens review to produce an objective assessment of the preparation and performance of the Irish Teams at the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Athens 2004. The review was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of all aspects of the programmes and structures over the course of the four-year cycle leading into the Athens games with a view to making recommendations for the development of programmes for the 2008 Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games. The final report, which was published on 2 March 2005, draws on the lessons of the past four years and on international experience to set out how we can achieve consistent success at Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">The Irish Sports Council has completed its assessment of the conclusions and recommendations of the Athens review and has prepared its operational plan, which addresses key performance indicators, timescales and costings and identifies the roles of the various agencies, as it supports Ireland's Olympic and Paralympic preparations for Beijing.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">I have just received the council's detailed proposals and my Department is undertaking its consideration of the operational plan. The plan encompasses elements such as the introduction of targeted sport performance plans, including prioritising junior, development and elite athletes; a review of the international carding scheme; proposals for the development of an Irish institute of sport; maintaining and enhancing the role of the Olympic and Paralympic performance committees to ensure optimum co-operation in the preparation and performance of the Irish team for the Beijing Olympic Games; and the strengthening of the Olympic Council of Ireland's administrative capacities.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">I will ensure that the details of the plan are given immediate attention in my Department, including any associated funding implications. I will then be in touch with the Sports Council at the earliest possible date to help ensure that appropriate, effective interventions will underpin Ireland's preparations for Beijing and beyond.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_895">I welcome that the detailed proposals from the Irish Sports Council's assessments of the conclusions and recommendations of the Athens review are with the Minister. Does he intend to publish the report? On the Minister's reply to a similar question on 10 May 2005, what does he consider a reasonable timescale to achieve a major benefit from improved and sustained investment, focused on the most talented athletes? Will he expand on his statement of 10 May 2005 that there must be a focus on junior and developing athletes? What discussions, if any, has he had with the Minister for Education and Science in this regard?</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_896">There is no difficulty in publishing the report. The development of high performance athletes requires a long-term approach. There is no point in believing it can be done overnight. Research indicates it takes ten years of training to develop an elite athlete. It must be remembered that the Irish Sports Council's high performance strategy was only published in 2002. Our strategy is a long-term one. I do not want this misinterpreted, as it was before, to mean that Ireland will not win an Olympic medal for the next 16 years. If we are to make a meaningful input into the development of our sportsmen and women, it will take time.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">The timescale involved is at least ten years. If we are to have success across a range of disciplines on a consistent basis, we need to implement the high performance athletes strategy. This includes the international carding scheme and enhancement programmes. I hope we will see further developments on an infrastructural level, in particular in the sports medicine context. The strategy being pursued is the correct one and will yield results. In the interim, we may have success of a more sporadic nature. However, the plan in place is a good one.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">For example, New Zealand, a country of a similar size to Ireland, embarked on a strategy 20 years ago to ensure that it had a good yield at major international sporting events such as the Olympics. It has happened on a consistent basis for New Zealand since then. I aim to ensure that Ireland does the same. Whoever succeeds me in this position will seek to do likewise.</p>

            <p eId="para_899">There are three years to go to the Beijing games. It is important that the strategy and the various recommendations be put in place as soon as possible.

            <from>Mr. O’Connor</from>
            <p eId="para_904">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this serious issue. He will know, as other Members do, that I often raise issues relating to Tallaght. I am positive about the town, the third largest population centre in the State. Tallaght has often been described as having the population of a city but the status of a village. Thankfully, over the past 14 years, there has been much progress in this regard. Tallaght now has the facilities and infrastructure one expects in a new town. These include the town square, the hospital, the civic centre and the institute of technology. On an ongoing basis, it is the local Members' role to highlight the needs of Tallaght as a new town and look for the facilities and services required.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">This issue I have raised relates to a women's refuge project which has been under consideration for some time. Over the years, a strong case was made for a women's refuge in Tallaght. The need was highlighted by the Saoirse group working towards the building of the refuge for the last ten years. It was identified as a necessity in numerous reports and plans for the area, including the 1997 report of the task force on violence against women, the eastern regional planning committee on violence against women development plan, the South Dublin County Council development plan, the RAPID plan for west Tallaght, the Health Service Executive's south-west area service plan and the Homeless Agency plan. Organisations including Saoirse, the Swan group and Tallaght Welfare have made the argument for the refuge for some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">Much progress was made to the extent that South Dublin County Council identified a building and offered it to the refuge committee. It also received funding from the RAPID programme for the building's refurbishment. All was well until the Health Service Executive dropped the bombshell that it is not in a position to offer funding for the refuge. I hope that whatever his prepared script tells him, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will tell his departmental officials that this is a serious issue for Tallaght. It would only take a small amount of money to get the project running. There is a strong demand in Tallaght for this particular service.</p>

          <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_356">
            <from>Mr. O’Connor</from>
            <p eId="para_909">In an editorial last week, it claimed the decision of the Health Service Executive to withdraw funding for the women's refuge in south Dublin for victims of domestic violence is a disgrace and should be reversed immediately. I do not want to pile it all on the Minister of State but this is a serious issue. On a day when the Health Service Executive is applauding its new chief executive, it must be able to respond to this situation. If funding is not made available, if this building reverts to South Dublin County Council and if the RAPID funding is returned, those involved in the campaign for the refuge claim the project will never happen. This would be a shame.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">I hope the Department of Health and Children, under the leadership of the Tánaiste and the Ministers of State, including Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is present, will help us. The women of Tallaght seek the assistance of the Department in this regard and I hope it will be forthcoming.</p>

            <p eId="para_911">I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank and congratulate Deputy O'Connor for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to this House the current position regarding the opening of a women's refuge in Tallaght, Dublin 24. I reassure the Deputy that the matter will receive a great degree of attention in both the Department and the Health Service Executive. I take issue with the local journal cited by the Deputy, in that it is not a question of cutbacks but a question of providing funding for a new project.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">The Deputy is aware that the management and delivery of health and personal social services is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.</p>

            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_914">However, I understand from the Health Service Executive that this matter is receiving attention and the issue was discussed as recently as this week by the housing agency funding assessment panel, which is a partnership co-ordinating body of the HSE and local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">I also understand there was a plan to develop a refuge in Tallaght as part of a social housing project which was to be completed in 2006 and that the attendant costs would arise then. The offer of premises by South Dublin County Council, while welcome, was at short notice. In the context of the current year, it has come at a time when there was no financial allocation available for such an initiative. Nonetheless, the HSE remains in discussions with Saoirse and the housing agency on the issue of the Tallaght women's refuge. I have asked the HSE to keep me updated on all developments on this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_916">The issue of violence against women is receiving much attention within the Department. My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, has asked the HSE to undertake a review of funding to all services within this sector and to report findings and recommendations to her. Simultaneously, the national steering committee on violence against women, in which the Department participates, is compiling a strategy for its work over the coming five years. The Department awaits recommendations and attendant funding decisions when this strategy has been completed and agreed upon.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">The policy in regard to such services remains an important issue within the Department and as already stated, the management and delivery of such services is now a matter for the Health Service Executive.</p>

          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_918">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for providing me with this opportunity to raise the issue of the death of Ms Anne Carroll, who took her life in an occupied and staffed six-bed psychiatric ward at Cork University Hospital on Sunday, 17 October 2004. I wish to express my sympathy to the members of Anne Carroll's family and to empathise with them in their sad and traumatic bereavement.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">From her late teens until her death, she suffered from depression and anxiety. However, despite her illness, Anne was a happy and fun-loving person, who took a keen interest in history and horticulture. Her greatest interest was in her family, the home farm, but most of all in her mother who suffered ill-health and for whom she tenderly cared.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">On 29 August 2004, Anne took an overdose and remained in a coma and on life support for four days in the intensive care unit of Cork University Hospital. Thanks to the dedicated medical care of the staff in the intensive care unit at CUH, she regained consciousness and was subsequently rehabilitated in a medical ward at the hospital. On 6 September 2004, she was transferred to ward GF in the acute psychiatric unit at Cork University Hospital. She remained a registered patient in the GF psychiatric ward at Cork University Hospital until her death on 17 October 2004. Throughout this time, she remained in an extremely depressed and anxious state, but had the support of her family at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">From 6 September to 17 October 2004, the family forcefully expressed its concern at Anne's condition to the staff of the GF psychiatric ward at Cork University Hospital. However the staff did not concur with the family's assessment. On 15 October 2004, she was deemed to be fit enough for discharge on a weekend home break, to return on Monday, 18 October with a view to being discharged. The family spent long hours during Friday night and Saturday of this weekend break reassuring her of its support and helping her out due to her severely depressed and anxious state.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">On Sunday, 17 October 2004 Anne was found by her brother, at home, attempting to stab her chest with a knife and subsequently, while he telephoned her sister, she cut her wrist with razor blades. The family immediately rang the GF psychiatric ward at Cork University Hospital to advise the staff of the situation and to state that Anne was being returned to their care immediately. At 2 p.m. on Sunday, 17 October Anne was presented for readmission to the staff of GF Ward in the hospital, even though she was a registered patient on weekend release. She was first seen by a nurse and openly admitted that she had tried to stab herself and cut her wrists, as all she wanted to do was die. A full 90 minutes after arriving at the ward the doctor on duty eventually saw her. Throughout the waiting time of 90 minutes, she was extremely agitated and distressed and continually asked the nurses on duty if a bed was available for her. During her consultation with the doctor on duty, she was in a serious state of agitation, crying and telling him that she simply wished to die. After this consultation, the family outlined the events leading up to her readmission to the doctor and stated clearly that she was a serious danger to herself. The inability of any member of staff in the ward to confirm that she was to be readmitted was of extreme concern to her family and contributed, in the family's opinion, to her becoming more agitated.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">At 4 p.m. the family decided that it was obliged to take action and made the decision to leave Anne at the hospital and return home. This course of action was taken to force the staff of the ward to look after Anne who was extremely ill and a great danger to herself. At 9 p.m. on Sunday, 17 October, a telephone call was received from the GF ward at the hospital, requesting the presence of members of the family. On arrival they were informed of Anne's death. Anne was last seen alive at 7.35 p.m. by nurses in the office. She had gone to the office looking for something or other but was told to return to her ward and that a nurse in the next shift would look after her. At 8 p.m. Anne was found dead, having taken her life by hanging herself from the rail bar in her wardrobe in an occupied and staffed six-bed psychiatric ward at Cork University Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">In the opinion of Anne's family and me, this death was totally avoidable. She was taken into the GF ward in the hospital, having attempted suicide at home that day on two occasions. She had a very serious psychiatric condition and was crying out for professional care.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">She should have been on 24 hour suicide watch and such treatment would have been the proper approach to her condition. The family entrusted the care of its sister to the Southern Health Board and is extremely upset at the situation. I appreciate that anything that can be done will not return Anne Carroll to her family. However, my desire and that of her family is to ensure that no other family can be exposed to this situation. We ask for an inquiry independent of the Southern Health Board to examine the facts of the case.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_926">I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter on the adjournment this afternoon. The case to which the Deputy referred is a tragic one and I extend my condolences to the family concerned. Every sudden death, from whatever cause, of a patient in psychiatric care is most regrettable. It would be inappropriate for me to comment in detail on any individual case. However, I am aware that in line with standard practice, the clinical director of the South Lee Mental Health Service submitted a report on the circumstances surrounding the death to which Deputy Neville referred to the Inspector of Mental Health Services.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">Upon receipt of correspondence from a relative of the deceased in March 2005, my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'MaIley, sought a report in the matter from the Mental Health Commission. One of the statutory functions of the commission is to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">On 9 May, the Mental Health Commission informed the Department that it was seeking further information regarding this case from the southern area of the Health Service Executive. The commission has since confirmed that it has received the additional information requested and that it expects to be in a position to provide a report to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'MaIley, in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">As Deputy Neville is aware, the Minister of State has already indicated that he has decided to await completion of the final report of the Mental Health Commission before considering what further action may be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">The Mental Health Commission has indicated that should recommendations arise which are applicable to all mental health service providers, they will be incorporated into the quality framework currently being developed by the commission. This framework includes the development of standards for mental health care, clinical governance and codes of practice. The inspections by the inspectorate of mental health services provide for the ongoing monitoring of such policies and standards by the Mental Health Commission.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_932">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter, and I do not raise it lightly. When a group of workers at a company approached me with allegations of exploitation, intimidation, breaches of employee rights, dismissals, failure to pay staff, mandatory working, the use of sleepers, threats and allegations of sexual harassment, I had no alternative but to speak out and demand the truth. This is Ireland 2005, not Dublin 1913.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">I met other members of the company on Tuesday, 14 June at 11.30 p.m. and they denied all the allegations, except the non-payment of staff issue. It is important we get to the bottom of these allegations and I hope the Minister will conduct a proper and accurate investigation. We cannot tolerate exploitation of staff at any company and it is crucial we get to the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">I have no vested interest in this company but I wish to ensure all staff get fair play, equality and justice. Moreover, I also wish to ensure that all the allegations are dealt with in a fair manner. I received information that there were to be ten plus constructive dismissals. According to the terms and agreements of employment, salaries were to be paid monthly by electronic transfer on the first of the month, but this never happened. Payslips were received without payment or payslips were received when payment was made which, more often than not, was towards the end of the month. Payslips were dated differently from the date of receipt of payment, if received. Some employees, on commencing employment, were expected to work a month in hand and were only notified of this when they queried the lack of payment to their account. There were instances where new employees were expected to work between eight and ten weeks without payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">Some employees, although working with this company in 2004, never received a P60. Some employees and ex-employees, on contacting the tax office, were told they were not registered against any company for tax purposes, although they had been working for one of these companies for a number of weeks and, in some cases, a number of months. Employees who questioned the lateness of payment were usually isolated, subjected to bully-type behaviour or let go.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">There were instances where an employee who was let go was escorted off the premises as per instructions by management or they were called in to a meeting to be told they were being let go and on leaving the management office, they noted that their hard drives were removed from their desks. A policy of silence is enforced in some of the offices which ensures dismissals are kept quiet. Staff are discouraged from airing complaints and, as a result, employee concerns are rarely discussed, probably for fear of dismissal or not being paid. There are also instances where staff are expected to give management a hug, specifically female employees. On commencement of employment, employees feel they have very few work duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">Due to the current experience of this company, I call on the Government to implement, and urgently amend, legislation. According to some members of the company, their difficulties and conditions have been extreme. As a result of their collective experiences, I have learned just how unprotected are Irish workers. They are completely vulnerable to employer abuse and to the inadequacies of the law, including company law. Workers must have greater protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">I call for fundamental rights for workers from the day of commencing employment, including breach of contract, non-payment of wages, constructive dismissal, freedom from harassment, discrimination and victimisation and health and safety. I urge the Minister to listen and to investigate this matter which is in the interests of the staff, the company and, above all, the future of employment in this country.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_939">I thank Deputy Finian McGrath for raising this issue. I take it from the Ceann Comhairle's ruling that there is to be no specific reference to the company concerned but that I can refer to the body as the company concerned. I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">A prohibition on sexual and other harassment in the workplace has been in place since 1999 under sections 23 and 32 of the Employment Equality Act 1998. This Act is administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. With effect from 18 July 2004, these provisions have been replaced by a new provision, section 14A of the Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004, inserted by section 8 of the Equality Act 2004. The new provision is in line with Articles 2 of EU directives 2000/43/EC, the race directive, 2000178/EC, the framework employment directive, and 2002/73/EC, the gender equal treatment amendment directive. In both cases, harassment and sexual harassment constitute discrimination for the purpose of the Acts and are open to orders for redress in accordance with section 82 thereof. If an individual wishes to refer such a claim under either Act, he or she may do so to the Director of the Equality Tribunal, 3 Clonmel Street, Dublin 2.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">Matters relating to allegations of workplace bullying are dealt with by the Health and Safety Authority, Temple Court, 10 Hogan Place, Dublin 2, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I understand that there is no record of a bullying complaint in the HSA against the company. However, the Health and Safety Authority is involved in a health and safety welfare aspect with the company under safety, health and welfare legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Matters relating to dismissal generally are more appropriate to either the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission or the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts or Industrial Relations Acts. Both bodies operate under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Any such complaints should be addressed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Davitt House, Adelaide Road, Dublin 2, or to the Rights Commissioner Service, Labour Relations Commission, Tom Johnson House, Haddington Road, Dublin 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">Complaints relating to changes to terms and conditions of employment or delays in pay should be addressed to the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission at the above-mentioned address. Matters relating to P45 and taxation generally should be addressed to the Revenue Commissioners, Taxes Central Registration Office, 9-15 Upper O'Connell Street, Dublin 1.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">Issues regarding alleged irregularities in relation to payslips are dealt with under the Payment of Wages Act 1991. That legislation provides that employers must give to each employee with every wage packet, a written statement of gross wages — a payslip — itemising each deduction. The labour inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for monitoring compliance with this provision and in this regard I understand that an arrangement has been made for a labour inspector to carry out an early investigation regarding these concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">I understand that neither Enterprise Ireland nor lDA Ireland, the industrial development agencies under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has approved grants or paid out grants to the company concerned. I also understand that neither FÁS nor the relevant county enterprise board provided funding for the company concerned. In regard to the equal community initiative, no moneys have been paid to the company nor has any European Social Fund money been paid.</p>

            <from>Ms Harkin</from>
            <p eId="para_946">I wish to raise the proposed loss of a second mainstream teacher in Carramore national school in Killasser, Swinford, County Mayo. While I accept there were 45 students on the roll last September, the projected number for the next three years is 50 plus. It is extremely difficult to understand why there are three teachers teaching 45 pupils this year but it is expected that only two teachers will teach 50 plus pupils next year. That seems to be planning backwards not forwards. In recent weeks two new families have moved to the area and enrolled their children in the school, so there are now 50 plus students in the school. As a result, I ask the Minister to grant the school a hearing so that it will not lose its second mainstream teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">This is a small school in a rural area. If the number of teachers is reduced from three to two, it will have a huge impact on the quality of education for the children and on the morale of the school and the teachers. I could understand it if the trend was downwards but it is upwards. There was a slight dip last September but that has changed. As I said, there are now 50 plus students on the roll. There are real grounds for appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">We hear much about rural regeneration and development etc., but if basic services such as primary education are hit, especially when the trend is upwards, I do not see what chance there is for a school in a rural area. Many new houses are being built in the area and that means there will be more pupils in the school. The system must respond to current and future enrolment figures in the school rather than to past figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">As well as the prospect of losing the teacher, the school has been told that a prefab, which came with the third teacher and which is very badly needed, will have to go. It has been told it will be entitled to get it back the following year when the third teacher is restored. This causes severe disruption.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">Conditions in the school are poor. There are no outside facilities for play — it has a very small yard. It has been turned down for funding from the Department to renovate a playing field. The facilities are poor enough but if the prefab and the third teacher are taken away, I agree with the parents that it will be an injustice to the children who deserve better.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">The possibility of a school such as this gaining the status of a developing school whereby it increases its enrolment by 25 or more pupils is not relevant because it is a small school in a rural area. To apply such rules to schools such as this does not make sense. The idea that one size fits all discriminates against small schools, particularly small schools in rural areas. I ask the Minister of State to consider the appeal regarding the proposed loss of the second mainstream teacher.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_366">
            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_952">I thank Deputy Harkin for affording me the opportunity on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science to outline the position regarding Carramore national school, Swinford, County Mayo, concerning temporary accommodation and staffing at the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September in the previous year. The number of mainstream posts is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions between the Department and the education partners. The staffing schedule is set out in a circular which issues from the Department to all primary school boards of management. Accordingly, all boards are aware of the staffing position for their school in any particular school year. The schedule for the coming year issued in May 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">In the current school year the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises a principal and two mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 50 pupils at 30 September 2003. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will consist of a principal and one mainstream class teaching post. This is based on an enrolment of 45 pupils at 30 September 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">To ensure transparency and openness in the system, an independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The staffing of this school for the 2005-06 school year was considered by the appeal board on 14 June 2005. The board, having considered the appeal with regard to the criteria outlined in the Department circular 19/02, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule was not warranted in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">The board of management of the school was notified in writing of the decision of the appeal board on 15 June 2005. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate it would not be appropriate for the Minister for Education and Science to intervene in the operations of the independent appeal board.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">The school referred to by the Deputy has made a request to retain the temporary accommodation which is in use by the third teacher. The school planning section of my Department is considering the school's proposal and officials will be in contact with the board of management on the matter in due course. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_962">I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 19, 30 and 44 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">As I advised the House on 10 May 2005, there has been a major reform of Irish tourism structures in recent years with the setting up of Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland. Reform of the function, role and operational structure of regional tourism is the third and final leg of that reform process.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">The House will be aware that I have no direct responsibility in relation to the most appropriate regional structures for the discharge of Fáilte Ireland's functions and the relationships and arrangements that should apply at regional level — this is effectively a day-to-day matter for Fáilte Ireland itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">The House will also be aware that, in response to a recommendation in the tourism action plan set out in the Report of the Tourism Policy Review Group, Fáilte Ireland commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC, to conduct a major consultancy study of regional tourism structures as it sought to determine how best to carry out its new development mandate countrywide. I received a copy of that report on 13 April last, together with a letter from the chair of the Fáilte Ireland Authority indicating that the authority endorsed the recommendations in the report at its meeting on Thursday, 7 April. This report has been published and widely circulated by Fáilte Ireland and is available on its website.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">I have been informed by Fáilte Ireland that the PWC report highlights the need for a much wider brief for regional tourism, playing a strategic rather than administrative role and inputting more directly into national policy. It recommends a greatly increased emphasis on targeted marketing, product development and enterprise support. It suggests establishing an integrated linkage between regional tourism strategy and national policy and exploiting avenues to leverage increased resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">As far as the Dublin region is concerned, the authority arranged for a short engagement with the relevant parties in order to satisfy interests in the Dublin region that the mechanisms of consultation were complete. A small independent group, chaired by Mr. John Travers, facilitated this process and I understand that the issue was discussed yesterday at a meeting of the Fáilte Ireland Authority. I also understand that Mr. Travers will be submitting his group's report shortly to Fáilte Ireland, following which the authority will make known its views to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">My consideration of the policy implications of these views, together with the views of the industry, will continue over the coming weeks. I will be discussing the issue with the regional tourism authorities prior to the implementation by Fáilte Ireland of any changes to the existing regional arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">As I have said previously, there will be changes on foot of the PWC report. My key concern is to ensure that whatever changes are made result in more efficient and effective regional structures to service the needs of the visitor and the needs of the industry. The background work towards achieving this objective has been substantially completed and I expect to be in a position to take further steps towards implementation in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_972">I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 40 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">As Minister, I have no statutory responsibility for the Abbey, which is operated by the National Theatre Society Limited, a private company limited by guarantee. My Department and I maintain liaison with the Abbey at various levels, and I have been briefed on recent developments regarding the theatre's finances and financial accounts.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">State subvention to the Abbey is provided by the Arts Council, which is a statutory agency under the aegis of my Department, and one that is independent in the disbursement of its funds under the provisions of the Arts Act 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">The Abbey is a key part of Ireland's cultural fabric, and it is imperative that it be placed on a sustainable basis for the future. This was the background to the decision of the Arts Council late last year to allocate an additional €2 million to the theatre. The release of this funding was conditional on the implementation by the Abbey of a wide-ranging change management programme as agreed with the council. I understand that good progress is being made on many fronts with the delivery of this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">I was very disappointed to hear last month of the shortcomings in the Abbey's financial management system to which the Deputy refers and on which my Department was given a courtesy briefing both by the chair of the board of the Abbey and the Arts Council. That said, I welcome the decision of the board of the theatre to engage independent financial expertise to carry out a root and branch evaluation of the Abbey's finances. I understand that this report should be available by the end of this month and that it will then be discussed with the Arts Council following which appropriate corrective action will be taken.</p>

            <p eId="para_980">As I have advised the House previously, officials from my Department and the Office of Public Works over several years engaged in extensive consultations and investigations with a view to identifying a suitable location for a state-of-the-art National Concert Hall in Dublin. When last year it emerged that the university authorities were intent on completing the relocation of University College Dublin from Earlsfort Terrace to Belfield and had taken practical steps in that direction, the Office of Public Works advised me that reconfiguration of the site at Earlsfort Terrace, part of which is currently occupied by the Concert Hall, would provide opportunity for implementation of an imaginative design concept involving the provision of three separate performance spaces and access to the Iveagh Gardens. This innovative and exciting design concept has caught the public imagination as is evident from the positive public reaction to the proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">Officials of my Department met some time ago with the university authorities to register strong interest in having the site at Earlsfort Terrace transferred to the State as soon as it was vacated by UCD. The financial parameters within which such a transaction might take place have now been clarified with the Department of Education and Science and, accordingly, I intend in the near future to seek Government approval to proceed with the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall at Earlsfort Terrace.</p>

            <p eId="para_983">The objective of the "per cent for art" scheme is to ensure that an art work is commissioned as part of every capital project undertaken by public agencies, including Departments, with the cost provided for from the outset of project planning. Although implementation has been somewhat uneven, the fruits of the scheme can be seen all around the country, from the "Perpetual Motion" exhibit outside Naas, to Kiltimagh in County Mayo, to Waterford Regional Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">The national guidelines for the per cent for art scheme seek to standardise practice and approaches to facilitate the application of the scheme in a coherent and consistent way across Departments and agencies. The guidelines were launched in December 2004 and have been circulated by my Department to other Departments, local authorities and public bodies to ensure their implementation on as wide a basis as possible. A review of the implementation of the scheme will be undertaken when the guidelines have been in operation for a full year.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">It should be borne in mind that the purpose of the guidelines is to assist project managers. They are not mandatory and so there is no role for the Department in enforcing them. Reaction to the scheme has been generally positive and the guidelines are seen as practical and workable.</p>

            <p eId="para_995">The project to redevelop Lansdowne Road Stadium has already commenced. The end of 2005 has been set as a target date by which to have lodged an application for planning permission. It is not possible at this stage to guage exactly how long it may take to secure full planning permission. However, in anticipation of an early and favourable outcome to the planning application, I would expect that construction work on the stadium would begin during 2007. The period of construction is projected to be 29 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">The total cost of the project has been estimated at €292 million, of which €191 million has been committed by the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">As regards a venue for international and home soccer and rugby matches when the redevelopment project gets under way, I am aware that the IRFU and the FAI have considered a number of contingency options for rugby and soccer matches during the period when the existing pitch at Lansdowne Road stadium will be unavailable. It is a matter for these autonomous sporting bodies to make the necessary arrangements to ensure their match commitments are met. In this regard, I wish to place on record my appreciation of the readiness of the Gaelic Football Association to facilitate the IRFU and the FAI by making Croke Park available for major fixtures during the construction phase at Lansdowne Road.</p>

            <p eId="para_1004">Under the national lottery-funded sports capital programme administered by my Department, funding is allocated to projects that provide sports and recreational facilities at local, regional and national level.

The nature of the data created in relation to the sports capital programme does not lend itself to easy identification of particular facilities such as floodlighting.

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_1007">The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding for sporting and recreational facilities and equipment. While responsibility for the provision of facilities in national and secondary schools rests with the Department of Education and Science, applications from schools and colleges may be considered under the programme in certain circumstances. Such applications must be made jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must: provide for significant levels of usage by the local community during periods when the facilities are not being used by the school itself — at least 30 hours per week throughout the year; and demonstrate that the facilities concerned will meet an identified deficiency in that locality, as formally agreed with other local groups and-or the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">In this regard, it has been the practice of my officials to engage in discussions with the Department of Education and Science when considering applications involving schools received under the sports capital programme. Under the 2004 sports capital programme, grants totalling €1.327 million were allocated to ten such projects where the proposed facilities were to be clearly shared between schools and other community groups, including local basketball, GAA and soccer clubs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">Applications for funding under the 2005 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 5 and 6 December last. The closing date for receipt of applications was 4 February 2005. All of the 1,362 applications received before that deadline, including 30 related to facilities in primary and secondary schools, are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme at an early date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">The programme for Government includes a commitment to putting in place a long-term strategic plan to ensure the development of local sports facilities throughout the country. I wish to advise the Deputy that an inter-agency steering group has been established to oversee the development of such a strategy and is commencing its work. The group is comprised of representatives from my Department along with officials from the Departments of Education and Science, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance, in addition to representatives of the Irish Sports Council, Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited and the County and City Managers' Association.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">One of the issues likely to be considered by this group will be potential for greater co-operation between the Departments to ensure that the resources from all sources available to facility provision are maximised, including optimum usage of existing sports facilities by local communities and, in particular, those located in schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_1016">In January 2004 the Government decided to proceed with the development of a sports campus on the State-owned lands at Abbotstown. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, having consulted widely with the major governing bodies of sport, stakeholders and interest groups, put forward proposals for the development of a sports campus.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">This development control plan represents phase one of a wider programme for the provision of sports facilities. It proposes the development of pitches and ancillary accommodation catering mainly for the three major field sports — rugby, soccer and Gaelic games — as well as an indoor sports centre to cater for a range of indoor sports with spectator accommodation and also includes publicly accessible all weather floodlit synthetic pitches.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">I have considered the development control plan for a sports campus at Abbotstown in detail and it has my full support. I have consulted Cabinet colleagues on the proposals and will be seeking formal Government approval for them in the very near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">Between 2001 and 2003, a sum of €3 million was spent on site development works and site surveys; these surveys will be used when the project commences. Other than this sum there has been no capital expenditure on the Abbotstown Campus project at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">I am committed to ensuring that sports facilities of the highest quality should be in place at this time for the support of Irish sports men and women but I recognise that thorough planning and preparation are a prerequisite for a major investment of this nature.</p>

The programme is advertised on an annual basis. Applications for funding under the 2005 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 5 and 6 December 2004. The closing date for receipt of applications was 4 February 2005. The 1,362 applications received are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the 2005 programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">I have no plans to transfer responsibility for the allocation of sports capital funding to an independent authority. The current arrangements for administering the sports capital programme, which have been applied by successive governments over many years, have been extremely successful in ensuring that the programme is responsive to local needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">It is entirely appropriate that the Minister for sport should be in a position to use this important instrument of sporting policy to achieve objectives such as supporting projects of particular local or regional significance or encouraging the development of as many sports as possible. From 1998 to 2004 a total of €331.55 million has been allocated to 4,273 sports capital projects. This massive investment in the creation of a sporting infrastructure is now yielding benefits both in terms of local community developments and increased participation in sport. The scheme is administered in accordance with pre-determined eligibility criteria, all of which must be satisfied before projects may access funding allocated to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">I would remind the Deputy that as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, I am directly accountable to Dáil Éireann for the operation of the sports capital programme. This accountability is ongoing and finds expression, for example, through parliamentary questions, Adjournment debates, Estimates debates and engagement with Dáil committees. This is a feature which would be notably absent were the administration of the sports capital programme to be made the responsibility of an independent board. Apart from the obvious issue of how one determines 'independence', experience elsewhere has shown that decisions by independent boards do not always receive universal acceptance. Where a grant scheme attracts a level of applications well in excess of available funding, as is the case with the sports capital programme, unsuccessful applicants will always experience an understandable sense of disappointment whatever the decision-making process.</p>

A special purpose vehicle, the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company, LRSDC, has been established by the IRFU and the FAI to carry out the development project. The project is overseen by a steering group, chaired by my Department and comprising officials of my own Department, the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works as well as representatives of the IRFU and the FAI. Work on the project is already under way and to this purpose, earlier this year, LRSDC appointed a number of consortia to discharge various elements of the work. Of these, the design contract and the project management contracts are the two largest and key contracts at this stage of the stadium development.</p>

On that basis I am satisfied that the contracts have been awarded following an appropriate process in which full cognisance was taken of the circumstances outlined by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1150">It should be noted that appropriations in aid received in excess of the voted sum must be surrendered to the Exchequer under public financial procedures. Appropriations in aid in respect of health contributions are calculated based on an estimate and the actual receipts can fluctuate due to the trends in pay and taxation returns. Under the terms of the administrative budget agreement savings in one year are carried forward to the following year. The remaining surplus is a combination of a number of items covering minor headings and is due to timing issues in respect of items such as legal costs, the cost of the Hepatitis C and HIV compensation tribunal and payments to the State claims agency for the clinical indemnity scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1184">The report by Deloitte, A Financial Assessment of Decentralisation Costs and Savings, published in October 2004 included the broad areas of costs and savings likely to arise with the decentralisation programme. While the OSI plan did not attempt to identify or assess any specific cost savings that might be made, it should be noted that the current OSI headquarters office complex attracts a higher than normal level of expenditure on maintenance and repairs due to the ageing nature of the buildings. At some point the acquisition of a new building or a major refurbishment project for the existing buildings would have become unavoidable. This would be a factor in any assessment of costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">The data from the central applications facility, CAF, published in September 2004 showed that a total of 15 staff, three general service and 12 non-general service, within OSI have indicted a desire to move to Dungarvan with the OSI while 66, six general service and 60 non-general service, have indicated a desire to decentralise elsewhere in the country to other State bodies or Departments. Recruitment procedures for routine vacancies, which currently arise, ensure that the incoming employees are willing to decentralise to Dungarvan with the OSI. The OSI's implementation plan includes material on all issues to be addressed and incorporates specific risk assessment and mitigation strategies. Possible risk areas referred to in the plan range from transfer of knowledge and migration of IT systems to a new location.</p>

            <p eId="para_1236">The stamp duty arises irrespective of the age of the person who holds the account. I do not regard these charges to be excessive, and there is no evidence they significantly discourage people from using these forms of transaction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">Stamp duties on ATM, laser and combined cards are significant contributors to the Exchequer and are in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base to keep direct tax rates low. In 2004, the stamp duty on ATM, laser and combined cards contributed €35.3 million to the Exchequer. I have no plans to introduce exemptions from stamp duty on such cards for any category of individual.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">As the Deputy knows, the Government has done much to help those aged 65 and over. The income tax age exemption limits have been increased by approximately 150% since 1997 removing 75,500 elderly people from the tax net. In addition, the current rate of payment for old age pensions has increased by more than 80% above the rate payable in 1997. This is well ahead of the rate of inflation and represents a very significant improvement in provision for our older citizens.</p>

            <p eId="para_1246">I announced in my Budget Statement that my Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners would be undertaking a detailed review of certain tax incentive schemes and tax exemptions in 2005. I subsequently announced that my Department had appointed two external consultants to review separately four area based tax incentive schemes: urban, rural and town renewal as well as the living-over-the-shop schemes and the sectoral property based schemes; multi-storey car parks; park and ride; student accommodation, third level buildings, hotels and holiday cottages. All of these are scheduled to terminate on 31 July 2006 as set out in the Finance Act 2004. The consultants are also examining the reliefs for nursing homes, private hospitals, sports injuries clinics, child care facilities and the countrywide refurbishment scheme; these five reliefs are not time limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">I also made it clear at the time of my last budget that the tax exemptions for stallion and greyhound stud fees as well as commercially managed woodlands and the artists exemption would also be reviewed. Others which I have decided should be looked at for the 2006 budget are the reliefs for interest on loans taken out by individuals to invest in companies or partnerships, significant buildings and gardens, donations and patent income and the tonnage tax scheme and certain pension tax reliefs. None of these tax reliefs are time limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">As the Deputy is aware, a breakdown of the costs of most of these individual schemes and reliefs is not currently available, consequently, neither is the other related information which he seeks in respect of the aforementioned reliefs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">Following are the reliefs under review for which some statistical information is available to the Revenue Commissioners:</p>

It should be noted that as PAYE taxpayers were charged to tax on their earnings in the period from 6 April to 31 December 2001 and self-employed taxpayers were assessed to tax for the short year on 74% of the profits earned in a 12-month accounting period, data provided for the "short" tax year 2001 may not be directly comparable with those of earlier and later years.</p>

The names of those qualifying for the relief with effect from the 21 April 1998 are available and the list is set out in alphabetical order in each of the five categories of work covered by the exemption: (a) a book or other writing; (b) a play; (c) a musical composition; (d) a painting or like picture; and (e) a sculpture.

It is not possible to estimate the cost for first-time buyers purchasing residential property in excess of €635,000 as the stamp duty rate for such residential property transactions is the same for all purchasers and it is not possible to distinguish first time buyer transactions from other transactions in excess of that value.</p>

        <b>Mr. Bruton</b>
         asked the

        the outstanding recommendations of the Revenue powers group and their present status (details supplied).
        [20565/05]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_424">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1340">The revenue powers group was established in March 2003 to review Revenue's main powers and recommend changes. The group reported in late 2003 and its report was published in February 2004. At the time of publication of the report, the then Minister for Finance indicated his intention to allow a period for public debate and reflection on many of the wide-ranging issues raised by the recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">The group's main recommendations were as follows: some new powers for Revenue; automatic reporting of interest and payments by Departments; improvements in Revenue's off-shore information powers; enhanced powers of criminal investigation, such as access to telephone records, and the right of Revenue officials to question persons in Garda custody; reform of the statutory interest and penalties regime; reduction in interest rate from 11.75% to 10% and revision of publication limit from €12,700 to €50,000; improving the safeguards and preconditions for the use of certain existing powers, as well as extended appeal provisions; establishing current practice with regard to voluntary disclosure in legislation; and controlled information disclosure from Revenue to other official agencies such as ODCE and no disclosure where voluntary disclosure is made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342">In this year's Finance Act, I initiated the first measures in a process of reforms in the area of Revenue powers including a number of the recommendations of the revenue powers group. In brief, these included the publication limit for settlements with tax defaulters being increased from €12,700 to €30,000, the interest rate on underpaid tax being reduced to a daily simple interest rate equivalent to 10% per annum for non-fiduciary taxes and the repeal of the 2% per month interest charge for fraud and neglect, and the 200% tax-geared penalty for fraud from a current date. I also addressed a number of other issues within the general area of Revenue powers which did not arise from the recommendations of the Revenue powers group, such as the introduction of a statutory offence for aiding and abetting tax evasion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">Other recommendations of the group will also be administratively implemented or have already been implemented by the Revenue Commissioners. These include the following. The Revenue powers group had concerns regarding the modalities of exchange of information between Revenue and other agencies, in particular the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Revenue and the ODCE have recently concluded negotiations and signed a memorandum of understanding which will govern this information exchange and this largely meets the group's concerns. The targeting of audits will be continually improved through greater focus on risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">Regional powers officers have been appointed within Revenue to manage the use of powers in the new regions. Compliance costs will be reduced wherever possible and the cost of compliance will continue to be weighed up when considering the introduction of new powers. Revenue will aim to examine records at the taxpayer's premises where the removal of records would prevent the business carrying on in an orderly manner. Revenue will give more prominence to the external reviewers and in future will have them appointed using the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">I intend to return to some of the remaining recommendations, which require further consultation and careful consideration, for future implementation.</p>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the precise information requested by the Deputy is not available. The information available is a proportional breakdown by reference to asset types of the aggregate consideration underlying capital gains tax computations for tax year 2003, that is, the total selling price prior to allowing any offsets or deductions. The figures, which are based on CGT returns filed through the ROS system in late 2004, are as follows.</p>

        <b>Mr. Bruton</b>
         asked the

        his estimate of the cost of increasing pension relief to a standard credit equivalent to relief at 42% plus 2% health levy plus social insurance levy 3%/4% to the appropriate ceiling.

            <p eId="para_1527">Tax relief on individual pension contributions is allowed at a taxpayer's marginal tax rate, which is the standard or higher rate as appropriate in each case. It is assumed that the change mentioned by the Deputy is to provide tax relief at the top rate of tax for all pension contributions by individuals, including those currently relieved at the standard rate. It is not possible to provide an estimate in respect of employee and employer contributions to occupational pensions because the relevant data in relation to contributions is not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling this information. Tax relief for pension contributions by employees is normally given by way of a deduction from total income in arriving at income for tax purposes. This means the income for tax purposes of employees is net of their pension contributions, which is the net pay arrangement. An employer's contributions are an allowable deduction from profits and are not specifically recorded in Revenue statistics.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">Provisions were included in Finance Act 2004 requiring employers to provide data on superannuation contributions in the P35 form to be filled by employers in February 2006. Preliminary information should become available in mid-2006, bearing in mind the Revenue Commissioners have to carry out a programme to check the quality, consistency and accuracy of the returns. These changes will yield additional information on the overall cost of tax relief for pension contributions. As the returns will be aggregated at employer level, however, they will not provide a precise basis for measuring the potential impact on the Exchequer of proposals for changes at individual level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">For self-employed and certain other employees in pensionable employment, there is data available on relief on contributions for retirement annuity contracts, RACs, for the short tax year 2001. RACs are subject to a current contribution cap of €254,000. On that basis, the full year cost to the Exchequer, adjusted for a 12-month year, of the change mentioned in relation to the income tax change is tentatively estimated at about €23 million. It could, however, be considerably higher if the change resulted in new pension contributors claiming the relief. Generally, relief from the health levy and PRSI is available to employees only. It is not possible to estimate the cost of extending the relief to employers and the self employed as figures for their current liabilities in respect of these are not currently available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">The operation of and adjustments to the PRSI system fall within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. As such, questions relating to the matter should be directed to him.</p>

        <b>Mr. Bruton</b>

            <p eId="para_1532">Tax relief for mortgage interest and health insurance already operate as, in effect, refundable tax credits as relief is given at source to all, irrespective of tax liability. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost of making refundable the unused portion of the tax credits for home carers, one-parent families, widowed persons and rent paid in private tenancies is broadly in the region of €100 million annually. Tax relief for health expenses is allowable as a deduction against income at a taxpayer's marginal rate for annual expenses incurred in excess of €125 per person. There is no specified limit to the amount that a person may claim. Accordingly, the extent to which individual claims might exceed the tax liability arising in each case cannot be sufficiently measured centrally within Revenue to provide the necessary statistical basis on which to estimate the potential cost to the Exchequer of refunding the tax equivalent of the unused portion of claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">The relevant information is not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted investigation of the Revenue's records. In this regard, the Deputy will note that in 2001, the latest year for which actual data are available, 105,600 medical expenses claims were allowed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1535">Table 1 shows the budgets and outturns for expenditure and receipts together with the amounts surrendered to the Exchequer in the period 1997 to 2004. As the surrender to the Exchequer in any one year is a function of both expenditure and receipts in that year, it is not possible to identify the projects in respect of which the surrenders in the years 1997 to 2004, inclusive, were earmarked. Table 2 sets out details of planned expenditure which did not take place in each of those years and which contributed to overall gross savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">In general, savings under the annual Vote provisions arise within capital expenditure programmes. Prior to the introduction of multi-annual capital investment framework in 2004, Departments were allocated, within the annual Estimates process, a capital budget for the current year. No provision was made for the carryover of any capital savings to future years. The process did not facilitate best practice multi-annual project planning or guarantee future allocations for capital projects. The multi-annual capital investment framework announced by the Minister for Finance in the December 2003 budget, provides for five-year multi-annual capital envelopes and year-to-year carryovers and addresses these difficulties by enabling Departments and their agencies to plan and manage more efficiently and effectively their capital investment programmes. Savings arising on one year can now be carried forward to fund future requirements as part of a multi-annual capital investment plan. The framework will also ensure that both a proper balance is maintained between different areas of investment and that value for money is obtained from capital investment.</p>

Cork County Council submitted a proposal to the Department in 2003 for works to Garnish Pier at an estimated cost of €750,000. A programme for the funding of small harbours within the overall 2005 fishery harbours development programme is under consideration. Funding for Garnish Pier will be considered under the programme taking into account the amount of Exchequer funding available and overall national priorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1742">On 1 November 2001, the Colombian Ministry for Foreign Affairs notified the Department of Foreign Affairs that Irish nationals travelling to Colombia, including those travelling as tourists, would henceforth require a visitor's visa. Colombian nationals travelling to Ireland also require a visa to enter this country. I am not aware of any changes in visa requirements since 2001.</p>

            <p eId="para_1744">Under the local authority swimming pool programme administered by my Department, there are four principal stages in the grants process. These are feasibility study, preliminary report, contract documents and tender approval followed by construction. Specific ministerial approval is required before a project can move from one stage to the next. The original proposal submitted to the Department by North Tipperary County Council and Roscrea Community and Tourism Leisure Centre was to build a swimming pool on a site in the grounds of the former Convent of the Sacred Heart in Roscrea. However, in February of this year and on the basis of advice from their consultants, the council submitted a new feasibility study and preliminary report proposing that the project should instead proceed on lands owned by the council on the old Dublin Road. The proposal is under consideration in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1746">The local authority swimming pool programme administered by my Department is designed to make grant aid available to local authorities for the building or refurbishment of public swimming pools. In either case, the programme provides for a maximum grant level of 80% of eligible costs or 90% in the case of disadvantaged areas subject to a maximum of €3.8 million. There are no plans at present to increase this grant amount.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">In 2000, Thurles Town Council proposed to refurbish the existing swimming pool in the town. The preliminary report for the proposal was approved in October 2000. However, in August 2003 Thurles Town Council submitted a revised preliminary report proposing the construction of a replacement pool on the existing site on the basis that refurbishment of the existing pool would not then have been economically viable. The revised preliminary report was approved in July 2004, which allowed Thurles Town Council to prepare contract documents for the project. I approved the contract documents in May 2005. Approval allowed the town council to invite tenders for the work proposed. It is the responsibility of Thurles Town Council to meet any balance of costs between the grant and the tender price for the project. Thurles Town Council has not advised my Department of any difficulty in meeting this responsibility.</p>

            <p eId="para_1777">Two points must be borne in mind when considering these figures. First, the Department was reconfigured in 2002 as the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, having formerly been the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Second, the surplus figures shown represent the net end-of-year position, taking into account the reallocation of savings achieved within the Vote and the offsetting of any shortfall in appropriations-in-aid, where necessary. Net surpluses arose from savings on a variety of schemes and projects, due to factors outside the control of the Department. Full explanations for significant variations between Estimate provision and outcome for each of the subheads within my Department's Vote are contained in the annual appropriation accounts and report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, volume 2.</p>

            <p eId="para_1814">My Department supports the film industry in Ireland at a number of levels. The Irish Film Board, an independent statutory agency under my Department's aegis, provides a broad range of supports for all stages of the industry, from up-and-coming producers to more well-established players operating at the international level. The board is also responsible for overseas marketing of Ireland as a filming location. My Department's support for the Irish Film Board increased from €11.85 million in 2004 to €14.45 million in 2005, an increase of 22%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">My Department also has responsibility for section 481 of the Taxes (Consolidation) Act 1997 incentive for investment in film production. This incentive is a critical part of what we can offer international film producers, and it has now been extended to at least 2008, with the amount that can be raised increased to €15 million per film from 1 January 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">I am aware that residual difficulties remain because of the euro-dollar exchange rate, and increasing competition from lower-cost jurisdictions. My Department and the film board will be carefully monitoring this situation as it develops with a view to ensuring that Ireland remains an attractive location in which to make films.</p>

            <p eId="para_1818">The national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sport clubs and to sporting and voluntary and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. Between 1998 and 2004, €331.55 million was allocated under the programme to 4,273 projects throughout Ireland. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">Applications for funding under the 2005 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 5 and 6 December last. The closing date for receipt of applications was 4 February 2005. A total of 1,362 applications were received before that deadline. All of the applications received are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the 2005 grant allocations under the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1827">My Department supported the "ReJoyce — Dublin 2004" festival, which took place between April 2004 and August 2004. I established the Bloomsday centenary co-ordinating committee early in 2003, on which my Department was represented, with a view to co-ordinating and augmenting the many events planned to celebrate the centenary of the day on which the events in <i>Ulysses</i> took place. The festival was very successful in terms of enhancing a wide range of Joyce-related activities of both specialist and mass appeal, and as a quality cultural tourism initiative. Funding for the festival amounted to just under €200,000 in 2003 and just under €1 million in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">My Department also funded the China Festival, which was organised under the memorandum of understanding on cultural co-operation with China, signed in September 2001. Funding for the China Festival amounted to €20,000 in 2002, €707,000 in 2003 and €2,040,000 in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">The Deputy might also wish to note that Fáilte Ireland administers the festivals and cultural events initiative; a scheme was set up some years ago to expand regional tourism through festivals and cultural events by assisting with the marketing activities of existing festivals as well as promoting new events. The dissemination of information about the number of festivals supported by Fáilte Ireland under the scheme, which includes the national St. Patrick's festival in Dublin, is a day-to-day operational matter for that body. Full particulars about the initiative are available on Fáilte Ireland's website, <i>www.failteireland.ie</i>. The Arts Council also provides support for certain festivals, details of which are available on its website, <i>www.artscouncil.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_1876">FÁS employment programmes, which comprise community employment, CE, social economy and job initiative schemes, will provide 25,000 places in 2005. CE provides work experience and training opportunities for the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups with the aim of assisting participants to progress to jobs in the open labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1877">On foot of a review of FÁS employment schemes, which included detailed consultations with the social partners, I decided that with effect from 10 November 2004 the three-year cap would be removed for CE participants aged 55 or over. This category of participants is now eligible to participate on CE for a maximum of six years. The extension of the participation period from three to six years for over-55s should ensure that there will be sufficient clients to fill the available places and will help to secure the continuity of community services generally. Employees who leave the social economy programme are being replaced.</p>

            <p eId="para_1915">The National Development Plan 2000-2006, NDP, set out an ambitious programme for the development of Ireland's road infrastructure. It prioritised the development of the five key inter-urban routes: Dublin to Belfast, Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Galway, Dublin to Limerick, and Dublin to Waterford. In addition, it provided for the delivery of key schemes in the Dublin area including the Dublin Port tunnel and the remaining sections of the M50 motorway. Very significant progress has been made on the delivery of the objectives of the NDP during the period since its inception.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">In assessing performance of the five major inter-urban routes in terms of key indicators against the NDP, it can be reported that all sections of these inter-urban routes will have completed their statutory approvals prior to the end of 2006; 45% of the construction schemes on these routes will be completed and opened to traffic by the end of 2006; in particular, 90% of the Dublin to Belfast corridor will be completed to motorway standard by the end of the current year; the Dublin region projects — Dublin Port tunnel and the M50 — set out in the NDP will have been completed by the end of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1917">In respect of the remainder of the national primary road network, the NDP estimated that the planned investment would achieve a level of service of 80 km/h on inter-urban journeys on 90% of the routes involved. By the end of 2006, it is anticipated that 76% of these portions of the national primary network will have achieved this standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">This overall investment in Ireland's road infrastructure is already paying dividends in terms of improved accessibility, removal of congestion problems, enhanced commercial competitiveness and safety. It is intended to build on this success in further improving the national road infrastructure over the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1962">I wish to advise the Deputy that the responsibility for the development of rail freight operations at particular locations rests with Iarnród Éireann itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_1963">It is my policy that Iarnród Éireann should remain in the rail freight business and the company has made significant progress in growing the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, such as in the carriage of sugar beet, cement and pulpwood. The company continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present. However, as in all businesses, it must adjust the freight business from time to time to reflect market realities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1964">Iarnród Éireann has developed a business plan based on a strategy with regard to freight which is to: break even by 2006; increase the profitability of the existing profitable business; withdraw from those businesses that are heavily loss-making; and target trainload container traffic. In formulating its plan, the company has held wide-ranging consultations with business interests around the country to identify those freight activities which are best suited to rail transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">The strategic rail review, commissioned by my Department, and published in 2003, contained a comprehensive examination of the rail freight business and its realistic potential to support economic development and contribute to a sustainable environment. This review has assisted the company in formulating its business plan.</p>

In general, expenditure under my Department's Vote is on programmes and grant schemes rather than specific projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2038">Most of the Department's expenditure relates to demand-led schemes, animal disease control measures and technical and financial costs relating to intervention. Expenditure in these areas is difficult to predict because it is demand or market-led, or dependent on the incidence of animal disease. Savings in 2004 related primarily to demand-led schemes including REPS, farm waste management, and forestry, and to the animal health area, where there was a significant reduction in the incidence of BSE, TB and brucellosis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2039">In the other years referred to by the Deputy in which there were significant savings, the main areas were are as follows: 2003 — the main savings arose in the market intervention area due to lower purchases than anticipated, in the animal health area due to lower levels of BSE and scrapie than anticipated, and in the early retirement scheme due to fewer applications than anticipated, 2001 — the main savings related to the purchase for destruction scheme because of lower than anticipated take-up, REPS, which is demand-led, and grant scheme payments under the national development plan, due largely to the foot and mouth crisis; 2000 — the main savings related to agricultural and rural development schemes under the national development plan because of the late approval of the plan, REPS, due to lower take-up than anticipated; and market intervention; and 1999 — savings related primarily to REPS and farm diversification measures, both of which are demand-led, and to expenses under the tribunal of inquiry into the beef processing industry, expenditure under which was contingent on decisions of the taxing master and the number of claims received.</p>

            <p eId="para_2091">The Deputy refers to two non-EEA nationals in his parliamentary question and states that the first person in question has applied for naturalisation and seeks to be joined in the State by his wife. My Department's records show that this person received a multi-journey, D-type residence visa in June 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">Unfortunately, the Deputy omitted to supply a visa application reference number in respect of the second person referred to. Consequently, it has not been possible to identify any application for the wife of the person in question. A search based on the name of the applicant as supplied by the Deputy did not yield any probable matches. If the Deputy would care to contact my Department with the correct visa application number, the status of the application will be determined.</p>

            <p eId="para_2094">I am informed by the Office of Public Works that the current temporary letting of the premises in Ashford used by the Garda will expire on 30 June 2005. Accordingly, at the request of the Garda authorities, my Department has asked the Office of Public Works to arrange for the renewal of the lease. Renovation or refurbishment of the old Garda station, which was badly damaged by fire, is one of the options that will require to be fully considered in the context of providing Ashford with a new, permanent Garda station for the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2100">In relation to crime figures the Deputy will be aware that, on becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I arranged for the publication of headline crime statistics on a quarterly basis to improve the quality of information available to the public. While caution should be exercised in interpreting levels of crime between quarters, I am pleased to note that during my term of office as Minister, the quarterly crime rate has decreased from 6.7 per 1,000 population to 6 per 1,000 over the longer period of 11 quarters for which figures are available. This trend is reflected throughout most Garda districts. In interpreting these figures, account must also be taken of the introduction by the Garda Síochána in 1999 of the new PULSE computer system, which led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case. In addition, taking into account the significant increase in our population since 1995, the headline crime rate has fallen from 29 per 1,000 population in 1995 to 25 per 1,000 population in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2101">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the attached tables show the headline offences, for the years 2000 to 2004 inclusive, for the Lucan Garda district which covers the Leixlip area and Naas Garda district which includes Maynooth and Celbridge areas. Figures prior to 2000 are not comparable with the figures from 2000 onwards.</p>

            <p eId="para_2400">It is not practical to put on the record of the House details of the entire careers of members of the Garda Síochána, apart altogether from the security implications which might arise. However, several members of the Garda Síochána most directly implicated by the findings of the second report of the Morris tribunal of either grave misconduct or grossly negligent management have been dismissed or have retired since publication of the first report last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2401">Some serving members of the force are severely criticised in the second report. The disciplinary implications of this are under urgent consideration by the Garda Commissioner. Furthermore, two senior members criticised in the report will retire with effect from 31 July. An additional five members, all of whom are of Garda rank, are to be transferred by the Garda Commissioner from Donegal to posts in Dublin with effect from 24 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_2402">No inference should be drawn from these transfers that the members in question are not liable to disciplinary procedure under the Garda Síochána code and the relevant regulations, or to criminal prosecution should the Director of Public Prosecutions decide to initiate any such prosecutions.</p>

Contractors employed by Bus Éireann are contractually obliged to keep their nominated vehicle in a safe and roadworthy condition at all times. I am satisfied, from information available to me from Bus Éireann, which administers the scheme, that these regulations are being adhered to and that, in consequence, the school bus fleet is roadworthy and safe.</p>

            <p eId="para_2408">Special needs assistants are assigned to schools to meet the care needs of individual children who have been assessed by a psychologist as needing this type of support. There has been no change to the criteria or guidelines for allocating special needs assistant support to schools and there are no plans to review the criteria or guidelines under which special needs assistant support is allocated.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">Applications for special needs assistant support are now dealt with by the National Council for Special Education, which processes all applications for support from schools and communicate the decisions directly to the schools. At this stage, the council has dealt with all new applications from schools for special needs assistants that will be required from the beginning of September 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2410">In order to ensure that resources are used in the most effective manner, a review has been conducted in recent months to establish whether primary schools have the level of special needs assistant support that they need for children in their care, whether they have resources which they no longer need or whether they need extra resources. The review has found that some schools no longer have the care needs for which the special needs assistant was originally sanctioned, that is, in some cases the child may have left the school while in other cases the care needs of the child have diminished as the child has progressed through the school. In this regard, the schools where surplus special needs assistant support was identified have been advised that they may retain this surplus until the end of the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2411">A review of special needs assistant support has recently been completed in the school in question. The outcome of the review determined that the pupil concerned should have shared access to a full-time special needs assistant. The level of support recommended was 20 hours per week. The school authorities were notified accordingly on 18 March 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2412">The Government has put in place an unprecedented level of support for children with special needs. Since 1998, the number of special needs assistants has increased from under 300 to over 6,300 nationally. In addition to this, more effective systems, such as the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, have been put in place to ensure that children get support as early as possible.</p>

The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis starting in the next school year. It will involve an additional annual investment of €40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2416">A key element of this new action plan is the better identification of levels of disadvantage in our schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The first stage of the identification process, conducted on behalf of my Department by the Educational Research Centre, is under way. Questionnaires issued to all mainstream primary schools and were due to be returned to the centre by 31 May 2005. The identification process is being supported by an advisory group which includes representation from the INTO and the Irish Primary Principals' Network.</p>

            <p eId="para_2421">In recent years many improvements have been made to enable principal teachers in primary schools to perform their administrative duties. Up until the 1999-2000 school year, principals were released from teaching duties to become an administrative principal where the school had a staffing of eight or more mainstream class teachers. From the commencement of the 2000-01 school year, administrative principals were appointed to ordinary schools with seven mainstream class teachers and in schools with a principal plus eleven or more teachers including <i>ex quota</i> posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2422">Since the 2002-03 school year, administrative principals may be appointed to schools where there is a principal plus nine or more teachers, including <i>ex quota</i> posts. The introduction of the release time scheme for principals of smaller primary schools for the 2000-01 school year marked a significant improvement in the conditions of service for the principals in those schools. This scheme enables teaching principals of primary schools to be released from their teaching duties for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative leadership and management functions. The number of days release time granted is determined by the number of mainstream class teachers in the school as outlined in primary circular 25/02. Paid substitution is approved by my Department for the days that principals are on release time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2423">Arising from the implementation of the PCW agreement, significant improvements were introduced to the management structure of primary schools through the allocation of additional posts of responsibility. It is a matter for the boards of management of schools to delegate functions to post of responsibility holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_2424">My Department is engaged in the development of a computerised on-line system for the submission of claims for the payment of certain categories of teachers.

            <p eId="para_2428">The school referred to by the Deputy opened in September 1996 with provisional recognition. Having met the criteria for recognition and proven its viability, the school was granted permanent recognition in 2000. Standard practice is that the school authorities are responsible for the securing of interim accommodation which is grant aided by the Department, pending the securing of permanent recognition. On being granted permanent recognition, a school becomes eligible for capital funding. The rate of progress towards a permanent accommodation solution depends on a number of factors including availability of sites and the Department's budgetary capacity to meet the level of demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_2429">The school is currently accommodated in prefabricated classrooms on a site of 0.75 acres in the town. The rental costs of the site and classroom accommodation is grant aided by my Department at the rate of 95%. My Department is advised that the lease on the site is due to expire in June 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2430">I want to assure the Deputy that we are acutely aware of the urgent need for an accommodation solution for this school particularly given the limitations on the existing arrangement and my Department is doing its utmost to achieve a satisfactory outcome at the earliest possible date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2431">To that end, the property management section of the Office of Public Works has been actively engaged in seeking a suitable site for a new school building.

The result of the tests and final assessment of site suitability is expected to be concluded and with my Department in a week or two.</p>
            <p eId="para_2432">As the board and patron are already aware, the provision of interim accommodation remains the responsibility of the board until such time as my Department is in a position to provide a permanent solution. However, I am sure that all partners will work together to secure alternative interim accommodation should that be required pending the provision of permanent accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2434">Details of the total annual budget for my Department and the percentage of the budget that was underspent in each year are given in the table below. The Deputy should note that the annual Estimates and budgetary process is not generally constructed on the basis of individual projects but that total expenditure is broken into a number of subheads. Underspends and overspends can occur in any of the Department's expenditure subheads for a number of reasons such as an over-run or an under-run in demand-led expenditure such as pensions or the student support schemes. The published annual Appropriation Accounts indicate for each subhead where the full allocation has not been utilised. Should the Deputy require more information on a particular aspect of my Department's budget, I would be happy to provide it.</p>

            <p eId="para_2480">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule is outlined in primary circular 15/05 which issued to all primary schools recently. This is in line with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. In the current school year the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises of a principal and 12 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 328 pupils on 30 September 2003. The school also has a learning support post and the services of a shared resource post based in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2481">The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005 to 2006 school year will consist of a principal and 11 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 311 pupils at 30 September 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2482">The staffing schedule is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. School authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_2483">To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02. The board of management of the school has submitted an appeal to the staffing appeals board under developing school criteria. As outlined in the relevant application form, this appeal will be considered by the appeals board at its meeting in October 2005. The board of management will be notified of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2497">No additional educational psychologists have been assigned to national schools in County Kildare so far in 2005. At present, a total of 72 national schools in County Kildare do not have a National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologist assigned to them. However, it is important to note that all schools in the county have access to psychological assessments, either directly through NEPS or, for those that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them, through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2498">Under this scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologists concerned. Details of this scheme, including the conditions that apply to it, are available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2499">NEPS also provides assistance to all schools that suffer from critical incidents, regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. Also, in respect of all schools, NEPS responds to queries regarding individual children from other sections and agencies of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2500">On behalf of my Department, the Public Appointments Service has recently initiated a new recruitment competition for NEPS. Any increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS must take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</p>

        <b>Ms Enright</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
        the reason there has been a change in the criteria for supporting a resource teacher to a school (details supplied) in County Offaly from one resource teacher per 80 pupils to one resource teacher per 135 pupils with the resulting loss of 60% of a teaching post; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that this has happened in a school that is an all boys’ school and has designated disadvantaged status; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2546">The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS, and the Giving Children an Even Break, GCEB, programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2547">Under the disadvantaged areas scheme the school benefits from one additional <i>ex quota</i> teaching post, additional capitation grants of €38.09 <i>per capita</i>, a refund of the television licence fee and eligibility for 95% building grants for building projects. Designated disadvantaged schools are included in the home school community liaison scheme and the school has access to the services of a shared home school community liaison co-ordinator.</p>
            <p eId="para_2548">Under the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, the school is benefiting from supplementary funding to provide additional educational supports for pupils who are considered to be at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The level of funding provided under this scheme is commensurate with the number of "at risk" pupils in the school. The school is not considered eligible for additional teaching staff under this scheme, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils within its enrolment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2549">As the Deputy is aware, a new general allocation scheme has been announced under which schools will be provided with resourcing teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2550">The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system and to ensure continuity of service for children who have previously been given an individual allocation until those children leave the primary school system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2551">The general allocation for the school in question is one teaching post and ten part-time hours. In addition, the school may be entitled to retain part-time hours under transitional arrangements to cater for the needs of individual pupils with high incidence special needs until such time as these pupils leave the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2552">I can confirm that the school's resource teaching allocation under the new scheme is based on its status as a boys' school, that is, the first post is allocated at 135:1. Schools whose allocations are based on 80:1 are those disadvantaged schools that are specifically eligible for additional staffing under the urban dimension of the Giving Children an Even Break scheme. This school is not eligible for such additional staffing and so does not qualify for the special 80:1 ratio for resource teacher allocation. I can confirm that this school was never eligible for the 80:1 ratio.</p>

The majority of authorities have reviewed their schemes over the past two years with a view to streamlining their operation. The introduction of systems of medical prioritisation as well as standardisation of costs and improved arrangements for the use of occupational therapists has enabled authorities to manage the schemes more efficiently and has allowed them to tackle the backlog of applications which had been allowed to build in a number of areas.</p>
