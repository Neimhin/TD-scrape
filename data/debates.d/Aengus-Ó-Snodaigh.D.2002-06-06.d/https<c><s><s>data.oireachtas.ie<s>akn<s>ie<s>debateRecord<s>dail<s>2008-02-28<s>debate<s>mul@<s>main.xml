The high number of off-licences opening in communities with little or no consultation with the community is in need of particular attention as is the selling of alcohol in shops and supermarkets.  Communities should be consulted on how best to tackle the serving of alcohol to minors by proxy or otherwise.  The role of the Garda Síochána and the measures it should take with regard to offending licence holders should also be debated.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_9">I object to this.  The all-party Oireachtas committee dealing with this matter discussed it for two and a half days and it would have made very good public television.  At the end, it emerged the Minister for Health and Children gave an instruction to the HSE to get on with the implementation of her proposals for 1 March.  Two proposals were voted on by the committee, one tabled by the Labour Party and one tabled by Fine Gael.  Both were voted down.  A bland amendment was then tabled which had to be accepted unanimously.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Genuine concern exists among the vulnerable and the elderly that arising from this they may not be able to obtain their prescription drugs.  The Minister made an arrangement for what she states is an independent audit.  The pharmacists state they will not break their contract.  It should have been possible to have had rational discussions on this and to reach a conclusion without the mess which may emerge on 1 March.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I would prefer to have a motion tabled on this matter.  One after another, Fianna Fáil speakers have blamed the HSE and stated it is terrible that vulnerable people may be faced with pharmacists withdrawing their services from the scheme.  Having a series of statements again today merely reiterates what many speakers already stated at the Oireachtas committee.  Therefore, I object to this and state it should be a motion upon which the House can vote after hearing what speakers have to say.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_13">The Labour Party is opposed to the proposal for dealing with this matter for two reasons.  The first of these is that the format is not satisfactory.  Last week, I called for a debate in the House on a report from the committee which spent a great deal of time considering and discussing this matter.  Such a debate should be accompanied by a resolution on which the House could agree.  This would give a direction to the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE on what is to be done about this long drawn-out dispute which should have been settled long ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The second reason is that while the debate proposed will be useful to ventilate opinions on the dispute, it will not deal with the problem which will arise at the weekend, namely, that this new contract will be implemented by the HSE on 1 March irrespective of what is stated here and irrespective of the consideration given to the matter by the independent body established under Mr. Sean Dorgan.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">When the matter was before the committee, my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, proposed the following motion:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16">That no changes be made to contracts between the HSE and community pharmacists in advance of the setting up and reporting of an independent body, whose remit will be to make recommendations on the reimbursement to pharmacists for drugs supplied under the State's community drugs schemes, in consultation with the interests concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">All week I have been listening to the Tánaiste and Ministers saying we should not prejudge independent bodies set up to examine various matters.  An independent body has been set up to examine this dispute which has been going on for a long time, which threatens the future of many community pharmacists and which is causing enormous concern to medical card holders, pensioners and people who do not know whether they will get their prescriptions where they normally get them.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The changing of the contract on 1 March should be put on hold until the independent body has examined this.  Will the Tánaiste change the format of today's statements so that we can debate a resolution, perhaps the one proposed by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan at the committee last week?  If not, will the Tánaiste give an assurance that the implementation of this measure will be put on hold until the independent body has done its work?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_19">Deputy Kenny referred to motions that were put before the Joint Committee on Health and Children by both Labour and Fine Gael, but that is only part of the story.  A motion had been put before the committee by the chairman of the committee, Deputy John Moloney, which had the indication of support of all opinions in the committee.  I commend Deputy Moloney's preparation of that motion because it demonstrated he has good instincts on this issue.  On the following day, however, his motion was withdrawn and that brought about a forced division in the committee.  There could have been unanimous support for the chairman's proposition because it met, as I recall, the views of all opinions, including those of this Deputy who attends those committee meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Why was Deputy Moloney's motion not allowed to stand?  What interference took place?  Why was it withdrawn and why was a much diluted amendment presented from the Government bloc in relation to the committee's deliberations?  That is a serious matter.  I very much regret that was the case because the committee had been working very much as a single, unified body in addressing this issue.  The divisions were both unnecessary and unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">It is imperative that we have a motion that gives clear direction in today's debate.  Statements simply will not suffice.  There should be a motion before this House.  It is within the gift of Government to present a motion along the lines as that drafted by Deputy Moloney and to put it before this House that clearly outlines the necessary actions to avert the crisis that will undoubtedly loom, particularly for those dependent on medical cards and the drugs payment scheme to access their medication.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">This is a very serious matter.  Many people, in particular older people, are very concerned as to what will happen in the outworking of all that is threatened as of 1 March.  This very serious issue requires the intervention of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  So far she has refused to address this issue in any substantive way.  Today's statements and a question and answer session will not suffice because there is no opportunity to direct the Minister to specific actions.  That is what is required today to avert a very serious situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">I oppose the proposal for No. 17 and appeal again to the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children to accept the collective view of the Opposition that we need to go forward with one voice from this House on this issue.  A motion must be put down that clearly demonstrates not only Opposition voices but those of Government Members — it has been demonstrated to me at the Joint Committee on Health and Children that Government voices on that committee also concur with that view.  From where is the interference coming and the silencing gag being applied and why is that happening?</p>

          <p eId="para_26">We discussed this issue yesterday morning and, as has been said, it was  well ventilated for three days at the Joint Committee on Health and Children under the chairmanship of Deputy John Moloney.  Today's statements will give an opportunity for the Minister for Health and Children to update the House and the public on the situation and to explain precisely what is envisaged.  As a result of ongoing discussions, an independent process to deal with the issue of the prescription fee has been set up.  It will examine how we can help smaller pharmacies, particularly those with a high dependence on medical card holders, to be better looked after financially than under the present arrangements.  The wholesalers have agreed to this on the basis of a fair return for their product and on foot of an Indecon report that sets out the situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">Perhaps the Tánaiste would ask the Taoiseach, who is meeting with the Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Donald Tusk, to express our sympathy to the Polish people on the death of the two young Polish men, Pawel Kalite and Marius Szwajkos, who were victims of an unfortunate and savage attack in Drimnagh.  This shames us all.  I ask the Tánaiste to communicate the sympathy of the Irish people to the Polish community in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Today's newspapers carry a report on a citizen who defended his wife and family at 4 a.m. yesterday in another savage attack.  During the last Dáil, Fine Gael brought forward a Private Members' Bill to rebalance the law in favour of the victim of crime.  The Government voted against that Bill and promised to introduce a Bill to vindicate the rights of the homeowner.  According to the then Minister, the heads of a Bill were already agreed.  Yesterday, however, the Tánaiste, in reply to Deputy Charles Flanagan, said that the promised Bill is not on the Government's legislative programme.  Who dropped it from the programme?  Why is it not included in the programme given the huge interest in this issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_155">The criminal law (defence of life and property) Bill will amend existing legislation regarding the defence of the person and the person's home.  The heads of the Bill were approved and we expect the Bill to be dealt with later this year.  The Deputy can be sure that the Taoiseach will, in the appropriate way, convey the sympathies of all Irish people at the savage killings of these two Polish citizens, who were contributing very positively to their community in this country.</p>

Yesterday he said the Bill was not on the legislative programme but today he says it will be taken this year.  Which is correct?  Is the Bill on the legislative programme?  Yesterday he said it was dropped.  If it is back on the programme, it might have been better if the Tánaiste had said as much before being asked.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">I join Deputy Kenny in expressing sympathy to the families of the two young Polish men who were so savagely murdered some nights ago.  Unfortunately, this is not the first time there has been this type of occurrence on our streets.  We have discussed it in the House previously.  The House and Irish society must have a serious discussion about the random violence that is occurring and the degree to which people are unsafe going about their business on our streets.  I hope the Garda is successful in apprehending the culprits and bringing them to justice.  I express my sympathy to the families on their really awful loss.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">I wish to raise two matters.  On Tuesday, a roof tile blew off a building on Pearse Street and traffic throughout the city ground to a halt.  On Wednesday, the safety system in the port tunnel crashed and traffic in the city again ground to a halt.  The Government has been promising the Dublin transport authority Bill since 2006.  The then Minister, Deputy Martin Cullen, promised in 2006 that the Bill would be published by Christmas that year.  Christmas 2006 came and went but there was no Bill.  It was the same story with Christmas 2007.  The Bill is still on the legislative programme.  When will it be introduced to provide for some co-ordination of traffic in Dublin?</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Second, it is reported that the Health Service Executive has frozen funding for the homeless sector.  According to the report, 60 new projects which were assessed for funding by the Homeless Agency cannot proceed in 2008.  A total of 55 homeless people died on our streets in 2006.  Money has been spent in this country on voting machines, equestrian centres and computer systems that never worked.</p>

If the economic fortunes of this country are turning and revenues are beginning to tighten, the first thing that will not be cut are services to homeless people.  I want an assurance from the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance — the Minister for Health and Children is sitting beside him and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is the line Minister, was present earlier — that the funding for the provision of services for the homeless will be continued.  A great deal of work was put into formulating a homelessness strategy, which all parties supported, with the objective of ending homelessness in 2010.  Much work was done at national and local level on securing locations and so forth.  Now, however, the Health Service Executive, presumably at the direction of the Government, is cutting the funding.  It will not happen, a Cheann Comhairle.  It must not happen to the homeless.</p>

I am not aware of any cutbacks in the existing level of services, which themselves have been considerably enhanced in recent years.

The Act was described by the Government, of which the Tánaiste was a member, as being the most draconian response to crime ever.  Is the Tánaiste aware that fewer than half of the Act's sections have been the subject of commencement orders?  In light of this and given that the Government appeared tough on crime by enacting criminal legislation described by it as "draconian" and unprecedented, does he agree there is an element of deception?  Will the Tánaiste ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to sign the commencement orders to bring the Act into force?  It is meaningless without such orders.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_273">I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the pharmacy reform programme, which one cannot isolate from the overall health transformation programme that has been under way for the past number of years.  The purpose of the latter is to deliver better services to patients and clients of the health service to ensure that we place a higher emphasis on quality of care and that people have access to health services at primary care level or in the acute system when necessary.  Since the establishment of the HSE at the start of 2005, the increase in the organisation's expenditure of more than €4 billion is greater than the total sum used to support the health service in, for example, 1996.  I want to put this fact in context.  That notwithstanding, we hear frequent references to cutbacks and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">One of the greatest increases in health budgets, in Ireland as in other places, is the rising cost of drugs.  We want to ensure that, as new therapies and innovations appear on the market, they are accessible to patients.  There are three main groups in the pharmacy chain, namely, the producers of medicine, the distributors to the retail sector and the pharmacists, the dispensers of medicine to patients.  Reform and better value for money have been recommended by many reports.  The most recent, the Brennan commission, was highly critical of our system of reimbursements under the drugs payment scheme, which I shall address.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">In terms of seeking better value for patients who purchase drugs and for taxpayers who pay more than 70% of the State's drugs bill, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children began to negotiate with the various components of the supply chain.  They began with the producers of medicine and achieved a successful outcome.  Heretofore, Ireland was in a basket of five countries, generally the most expensive in Europe, and paid the average price of the five.  We are now in a basket of nine countries, including Spain, and will pay the basket's average price to the producers of drugs, leading to a 10% reduction in our payment for new drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Drugs go off patent.  When drugs are on patent, companies that innovate are entitled to a return on their investments, which are significant in the area of pharmaceutical development.  Many investments never come to fruition.  When drugs go off patent, we will get a reduction of at least 35%.  Over four years, this represents a saving of €260 million.  Some have stated that it would have been better to move to generic prescribing.  According to the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics at Trinity College, we have done better as a result of the reduction of at least 35% than we would have had we moved to generics.  Our negotiated agreement with the producers of medicine is a good one and will benefit taxpayers and patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">In good faith, the HSE and the Department entered into negotiations with the wholesalers.  Our constant opinion, which I hold strongly, has been to seek to negotiate where possible.  However, in the course of the negotiations, the wholesalers produced legal advice suggesting that negotiating prices with any group was against competition policy in Ireland and at European level.  This was the first time the issue was raised.  When the HSE sought legal advice and I asked the Attorney General's office to reflect on the matter, it was confirmed that we are not free under Irish and European law to set down and effectively fix prices with any group.  This being the case, the negotiations on the price for the wholesale margin came to an end.  In Ireland, the wholesale margin was just under 18%, twice the rate in Europe.  To put this in context, in Ireland just over €1 billion was spent on community drugs in 2007 and it cost €600 million to take those drugs to patients.  It is incredible that it should cost an extra 60% to take products to patients and such a situation exists nowhere else in the world.  The wholesale margin of 17.8%, double the European Union average, was regarded as excessive.  Indecon was asked, as an independent consultancy firm, to evaluate this area on behalf of the Health Service Executive, HSE, and following its evaluation it was accepted that from 1 December 2007 the margin should be reduced from 17.8%, to 8% and then to 7% next year.  This reduction was delayed for three months to facilitate a Shipsey process that, unfortunately, went nowhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The wholesale margin will, effectively, be halved, which will save about €100 million in a full calendar year, or about €9 million per month.  The wholesalers accept that an 8% margin can allow for a quality service and give them a reasonable profit.  Recently when the HSE went to tender for the distribution of a particular product——</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_281">We are paying a wholesale margin that is roughly double the level of other European countries but it is now to be halved to 8% from 1 March 2008 and it will be 7% from 1 January 2009.  Independent analysis has confirmed that this is a fair return for a quality, frequent service that comes to many pharmacies twice daily that can deliver a reasonable profit to wholesalers.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">There is a virtual market here because the three main wholesalers have a huge interest in pharmacies; one has invested €300 million in pharmacies, another owns over 400 pharmacies and a third owns over 70.  There is a conflict of interest in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The State has a contract with pharmacists and for general medical service, GMS, patients, those who hold a medical card, pays a dispensing fee per item of roughly €3.26.  The drug payment scheme sees the State paying a dispensing fee of €2.68 with a mark-up of 50%; there is a discount back of 8% from wholesalers.  This comes to a gross margin in the region of 60% to 70% and I know of no companies, other than those with very innovative products, that have margins like this.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The Brennan commission was highly critical of the anomalies in how we pay for medical card prescriptions and how we pay through the drug payment scheme, DPS.  We must move away from cost escalators like mark-ups, which lead to spiralling drug costs.  It is not sustainable that more expensive drugs see a 50% mark-up and a dispensing fee.  For some years many pharmacies representatives have said there should be a flat fee for all services, whether obtained through the DPS or through medical card services, and I strongly support this.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">We must separate the price of the commodity from the price of the professional service provided by pharmacists.  Pharmacists are among the best educated and most highly skilled professionals in the country.  They are an important part of our health service and I want to see their role developed more fully than in the past, particularly regarding the management of chronic illnesses, preventative health measures and the like.  We want to negotiate a new contract with pharmacists through a process like the Shipsey process that is fairly priced by an independent group.  At the moment we are at a staging post to a new dynamic and new contract, to which I am committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">There will be no changes on 1 March in how pharmacists are paid nor in the contract between the State and pharmacists.  I am satisfied that nothing will happen next Saturday that will preclude pharmacists from paying staff and meeting business overheads.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">In 2002 we sought to change pharmacies in Ireland when the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Micheál Martin, lifted regulations that restricted where pharmacies could open.  The Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, felt this would be the death knell for rural pharmacies but there has since been an increase of 26% in the number of pharmacies in the country.  When I published the Pharmacy Bill in 2005, which sought to liberalise the pharmacy sector, I was again told it would lead to the closure of pharmacies but there has been an increase of 10% since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">There are roughly 1,600 pharmacies in the country and, on average, each received approximately €234,000 last year.  Many caveats apply to different jurisdictions but, on average, that is €100,000 more than pharmacists in Northern Ireland received.  In Northern Ireland there is a wholesale margin of 12.5% up to the first £180,000 and after that the level is 4%.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">This matter is not about reducing the price of drugs; it is rising all the time.  More people are entitled to medication, the population is aging and there is greater innovation.  If we want better value for money for taxpayers and patients we cannot justify paying €100 million more to distribute products than other European countries would.  Many Deputies have suggested to me that up to 200 pharmacies may close but I do not accept that.  Even if we were to support as many as 200 pharmacies, we are surely not suggesting it costs €5 million per annum per pharmacy to keep those 200 pharmacies in business.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Regarding contingency arrangements, I am anxious to ensure no patient is put at risk of not receiving medication.  If this happens it will be because of the game between the two sides — there is no other reason for it to happen.  Pharmacies must give three months' notice to withdraw from their contracts.  I understand two pharmacies in the entire country have said they will not dispense to the medical card patients on Saturday.  The HSE has a freephone line which it has advertised widely and will continue.  It has had 200 calls from patients.  In regard to every patient, it has been able to reassure them.  It has reassured me that if there is any patient on Saturday, Sunday, Monday or Tuesday who cannot get access to their medication the HSE will ensure they get that medication.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">We are being told that pharmacists will be charged more than they will get from the HSE.  That is not the case.  The manufacturers and the wholesalers have made that clear.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">I do not expect anyone to do business with somebody who will charge them more than they will get.  Any pharmacist who is charged more at the end of the month should contact the HSE and the manufacturers and that will be sorted out.  Of that I am certain.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">What we are talking about is getting a fairer deal for taxpayers and a fairer deal for patients and, hopefully, we can move very quickly into negotiating under Mr. Shipsey, or a process like that, a new contract that develops the role of pharmacist in our health care system.  That is something I and the Government want to see happen.  When that happens it will be priced independently.  In the meantime, as a temporary measure, €5 is being offered as a base fee for dispensing which is an increase of 70% over the current fee of €3.26.  The Sean Dorgan process has been put in place.  It includes Sean Dorgan, a well respected former Secretary General of two Departments and a director general of the IDA; Mark Moran, former chief executive of the Mater Private Hospital, who worked in the pharmaceutical industry; and Mary O'Dea, the director of consumer affairs with IFSRA, three highly respected independent people.  We have put no limit on what they can recommend.  We have further said, subject to Government approval, that whatever they recommend will be backdated to 1 March.  That process was put in place after a meeting I held with the IPU this day two weeks ago, because it considered there was a necessity to have an independent process look at the dispensing fee.  We have that process in place.  It has had its first meeting and will be advertising for submissions and will be meeting the various groups.  It is a matter for those groups to put, as forcefully as they can, to those independent persons their views on how pharmacists are to be paid a decent return for the service they provide.</p>

          <p eId="para_295">The Minister has just contradicted herself.  She wants a new contract negotiated and no changes to occur in the current contract.  Is changing remuneration not a basic and major change in any contract?  She would, of course, say she does not accept that, but she will find herself in a minority.  The survey carried out by the HSE was answered by something like 18 pharmacists, out of 1,600.  However, that is not the substance of what I want to speak about.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">I wish to put on record what the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children circulated:</p>
          <p eId="para_297">That no change be made to contracts between the HSE and community pharmacists in advance of the setting up, and reporting, of an independent body whose remit will be to make recommendations on the reimbursement to pharmacists for drugs supplied under the State's Community Drug Schemes, in consultation with the interests concerned;</p>
          <p eId="para_298">recognises the vital role the community pharmacists play in the delivery of the health service;</p>
          <p eId="para_299">further recognises that proposed changes to the contracts between the HSE and the pharmacists should be designed to allow for financial sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I had an addendum, which is not relevant here, but the first part of that is very relevant.  Why did that disappear from the floor of the Joint Committee on Health and Children?  What happened?</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_313">This morning's statements, apart from highlighting the situation, appear to be somewhat meaningless and we have had a vote on the Order of Business already.  What should be before the House is a motion calling on the IPU and the HSE to stand back from any precipitative action that would endanger continuity of supply of medicines to the most vulnerable in our society, that is, the elderly, the chronically ill and those with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I have already commended, on a number of occasions, the HSE on its quest for cheaper medicines for our people.  We all want value for the taxpayer.  We all want to see that but the manner as to how we achieve it is at issue here.  The HSE has sought through unilateral action to bully pharmacists into accepting new pay and conditions that are interfering with their current contract.  On the floor of this House before Christmas, we asked that the IPU and the HSE stand back and that neither would take precipitative action but would allow for an independent individual, Mr. Bill Shipsey, to facilitate a resolution.  My information is that following presentations by each side the HSE felt there was no further negotiation possible.  This, even members of the Government found incredible.  The nature of negotiations is that they are ongoing.  Many backbenchers in Fianna Fáil have expressed dismay at the manner in which the HSE is conducting its business.  Yet the HSE was able to tell us at the committee that it was acting directly under the Minister's instruction.  So, it is the Minister who shall have to take responsibility for the consequences of this unilateral change in the contract for pharmacists.  Let us not confuse the situation.  A new contract was offered over the heads of the IPU during negotiations in January with a rather intimidatory accompanying letter which suggested they would do well to sign the new contract or they could find themselves much worse off after the 1 March deadline.  That showed extremely bad faith.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">This is no way to conduct negotiations.  Furthermore the very "coincidental" involvement of the Competition Authority since this dispute began has bothered and worried many people in what is supposed to be a democracy.  The reality is that the Minister rightly sought to create savings and she has to be congratulated on managing to save €55 million from the manufacturers but she now seeks to take €100 million off the retailers whose gross income is €300 million, a drop of 33%.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The Minister mentioned her own Indecon report.  In that report, which I have read, it is stated that no sudden changes should take place.  Nobody who would consider going from 17% to 8%, a 50% drop, as not sudden — the Minister may not accept that but she will find herself in a minority.  The report also stated that it was unwise to compare the Irish market with other markets in Europe, yet the HSE continued to insist on comparing it to Norway, where I understand the market is controlled by two chains of retail pharmacists.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The Minister mentioned earlier moneys spent by one group, €300 million, on pharmacies and another group who owns 400 pharmacies and another group who owns 75 pharmacies.  There are 1,600 pharmacies in this country and there is a huge mix.  It has been pointed out that there are single operators, group operators, small chains, large chains and multiples.  Surely that is a great mix to have in a market.  The Indecon report also asked for an independent arbitrator to be put in place before any final conclusions were drawn, instead of which the Minister has made the decision to unilaterally implement the changes and then have a report.  What faith can people have in such a process?  The Minister is putting the cart before the horse and prejudging the outcome.  Even if she were not prejudging the outcome, when there is an outcome, after one, two or three months, how many pharmacists will have gone out of business?  What action will have been taken?  I certainly do not think it is in the best interests of the consumer or the market.</p>

There are 23 women, acutely disturbed, many menstruating with one toilet, one shower and one bathroom.  It is an absolute disgrace.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_325">The reality is that what has been attempted does not address the real issue the Minister has raised, which is the margin that wholesalers have, because as she already pointed out the HSE cannot negotiate with wholesalers nor the wholesalers with the HSE, because of the wonderful competition law.  The HSE misled the Joint Committee on Health and Children by telling it that it had a letter from the wholesalers assuring it that pharmacists would not be charged more than the reimbursed cost of drugs by the HSE.  No such letter existed.  What existed was a letter to an individual pharmacist from one of the wholesalers saying that it would "endeavour to ensure", which is a far cry from a guarantee, that drugs would be provided at the reimbursable cost.  No guarantee was given and this letter was certainly not addressed to the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Furthermore, the Joint Committee on Health and Children received a letter from the same wholesalers making it clear they would not be able to supply drugs to some of their community pharmacists, especially the smaller rural ones, under the new arrangements at the costs suggested by the HSE, completely contradicting what the HSE had been saying.  An issue raised by the HSE during the course of the joint committee debate and by the Minister today was that there would be no change to contract structures — what beautiful use of the English language — but that of course does not mean there would be no change to contractual quantums.  It is double speak, if ever there was double speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">I want to lay on the record of this House yet again that my primary concern is for the continuity of care for patients and continuity of medical supply to the most vulnerable citizens in our community, who are the elderly, the chronically ill and the disabled.  Serious illness is a grievous enough burden to carry without having to worry whether one will be able to access medication.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The net effect of this current action at the least will be the closure of many rural pharmacies as they find themselves sandwiched between the HSE and the wholesalers.  Those most vulnerable are the younger pharmacists who have purchased pharmacies in recent years and have serious overheads and loans to repay.  They will go out of business, thus further denuding rural Ireland of essential services.  We have already lost the banks, the post offices and now the pharmacies may go.  Rural GPs will be next, no doubt.  The Minister will complete her agenda, namely, to have corporatised pharmacies in the large urban areas without any regard to the needs of the hundreds of thousands of people who populate our rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">It is interesting that the concerns I have just raised with the Minister are raised in a letter from her ex-colleague and former Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Mr. Tim O'Malley.</p>

It becomes clearer and clearer that the HSE is out of control, which is what we all feel with regard to this monster the Minister has created.  However, when we reflect on what the HSE said at the joint committee, we might wonder if it is actually out of control.  Perhaps it is operating directly as the Minister wishes, under her instruction, and perhaps this is her view of how industrial relations should be conducted and her view of how a democracy should operate, through censorship of national radio by threat by proxy.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">Notwithstanding all the above and despite severe provocation by the HSE, I call on the IPU to ensure there is no diminution of service to patients.  I ask for the forbearance of pharmacists, despite all their frustrations, and hope the Minister will yield to pressure from her backbenchers, who are clearly very ill at ease with her <i>modus operandi</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">In recent weeks, this issue and the issues of cystic fibrosis and autism have been discussed on the floor of the Dáil.  We have heard Government backbenchers, including some senior, experienced Deputies, decry the Government position, yet they vote with the Government.  I find this extraordinary and I find the explanation offered, namely, that this is the way politics works, unacceptable.  It is not the future of politics I see for this country.  It is not what people elect their representatives for.  They expect their representatives to have the courage of their convictions, and the courage of one's convictions is not just to stand up and speak it as it is, but also to use one's vote to ensure that it happens. Whether it be children with autism, young adults with cystic fibrosis, people suffering with chronic illness or others with disabilities who require continuous medication, we need Deputies who will vote to ensure that these services are delivered and maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The pharmacists have a three-month notice clause in their contract and, as a result, the Minister claims patients have nothing to fear.  However, the reality is that methadone dispensing was withdrawn without any such notice being given.  This is scant reassurance to the many people who are worried about their medication.  My colleague, Deputy P. J. Sheehan from Goleen, County Cork, was visited in his clinic last week by an elderly lady in tears because she was so distressed at the prospect of not being able to get her medication.  Deputy Seymour Crawford knows of a lady with a disabled child who similarly wonders how she will manage to get her medication.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">I again implore the Minister to stand back from this action and allow the excellent Mr. Dorgan, whose credentials she has outlined, to come to his conclusions.  She will then be more likely to have the support of the House for her action.  To proceed before this happens will be to possibly put at risk the well-being of many of our most vulnerable citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">I urge the Minister to rethink this issue.  We are fast approaching 1 March, which is only two days away.  The Minister should listen to the voices of the majority of members of the Government parties and to the voice of reason, and not listen to her own political ideology and the bullying tactics of the HSE in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Although the Minister said that nothing will change on 1 March, everything will change.  On 1 March, the amount of money given to pharmacists from the HSE with regard to community drugs schemes will be cut by €100 million.  It is disingenuous of the Minister to suggest, first, that to have this amount of money taken from the income of any sector of society would not make a huge difference and, second, that, somehow, it is being taken from the wholesalers.  It is not being taken from the wholesalers; it is being taken from pharmacists.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">The Minister told us that the wholesalers refused to negotiate and invoked competition law.  At the same time, she told us the wholesalers are taking a cut with regard to their 8% margin.  How can the Minister tell us this when the wholesalers did not negotiate and she and the HSE have no power to in any way interfere with how or what wholesalers provide to pharmacists?  This money is coming from pharmacists.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Just a couple of years ago, as the Minster stated, the market was liberalised and opened up under her Progressive Democrats philosophy.  I understand approximately 300 new pharmacies were opened, largely by young pharmacists, but the Minister is literally cutting the ground from under them through a unilateral €100 million withdrawal from that sector.  Anybody with any sense of reason would have to accept this will have a serious effect and will cause job losses and closures.  I cannot see it happening any other way.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">We all want to see costs controlled for the good of the public purse.  The Minister referred to the providers — the wholesalers — but the cut is being taken directly from the pharmacists.  While we will have an opportunity to question the Minister later, I cannot see that the cut will be made in any other way and it is certain it will have an effect, particularly for patients.  For their sake, I strongly argue that the Minister should withdraw the 1 March deadline.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">We have all met seriously concerned elderly and sick people who visited us.  I am thinking of one woman in particular who came to see me in an extremely distressed state because she will lose the services of her local community pharmacist and there is no other pharmacist nearby.  She is greatly dependent on her personal relationship with this individual pharmacist, who has a very large mortgage.  That person also has a large number of medical card patients.  That is the real issue that the backbenchers sitting behind the Minister are concerned about, which they brought to the health committee and on which we had a long series of discussions.  There was agreement on all sides of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I accept there is disagreement on the exact wording of the motion that came from the Government side of the House but at the end of the committee process there was an agreed motion that called on all the bodies concerned to take action to find a settlement in advance of 1 March.  Even the Government backbenchers will agree that that was the general content of the motion that was finally agreed.  The motion that we proposed was voted down.  This would have ensured that the message from the health committee was that no action should be taken in advance of the report of the independent body.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I wish to voice my serious concern that all we have been provided with today is time for statements and questions.  We do not have an opportunity to vote on this important issue which is getting closer and closer to its deadline.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, will address the issue of rights under competition legislation.  He tabled a motion on behalf of the Labour Party to change the Competition Act, if that is the obstacle.  I again dispute the Minister's statement that European competition law is an element in this issue.  We can change our competition legislation if we want to and we offer that opportunity to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The Labour Party strongly believes in the right of any group of people to have fair process and to representation by their union.  That is being denied pharmacists.  I see in one of the medical journals today that the assistant national director of the primary care reimbursement service has said that will also very quickly be applied to negotiations involving GPs.  It will presumably also be applied to dentists and vets, and it has already been applied to actors under the Government's interpretation of the Competition Act.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  We on this side of the House, especially in the Labour Party, strongly believe in the principle of the right of fair process and representation.  If that is taken away from pharmacists next Saturday, 1 March, we can expect it to be taken away from other sectors of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Even the Indecon report commissioned by the Government stated that this decision should be taken slowly and that there should be consultation and agreement before any change is enacted.  What we have instead is a unilateral, bullying intention to take €100 million out of the incomes of pharmacists without an opportunity for negotiation and in advance of the report of the independent body, which I commend the Minister on setting up.  The Shipsey process was intended to offer that opportunity but, essentially, when the pharmacists got involved in it in good faith and without any preconditions, the process broke down because preconditions were put in place by the Health Service Executive.  The pharmacists said they would accept the outcome, whatever it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">In effect, the HSE approach was that the decision on the outcome would be made before the process even started.  That is not acceptable in any democracy and it is particularly not acceptable to us in the Labour Party.  I urge the Minster to take the opportunity to draw back from this dispute and to inform us when she answers questions later that she will instruct the HSE not to go ahead with the proposed changes on 1 March, but will wait for the outcome of the independent body's process.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">From talking to pharmacists I know they understand there is a need to address cost issues.  They understand that there is an issue for smaller pharmacists in particular.  I fear that if this decision is implemented the big chains will end up running the pharmacy business.  We will end up with a cartel of a very small number of large multinational pharmacy chains running the pharmacy business in Ireland.  The ordinary person who has relied in the past on the advice of his or her community pharmacist will no longer have a community pharmacist in any real sense of that term.  Instead, large chains will take over small pharmacies.  Pharmacists with large mortgages and wage bills have shown me their books and if this change is introduced they will not be able to pay either their mortgages or their staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I do not want Ireland to go in that direction.  It has happened in other parts of our economy that small businesses have been forced out of business and we should not stand over this happening in the pharmacy sector.  One of the aspects of the health service that works is the relationship between community pharmacists and their patients.  There is enough wrong with the health service and Deputy Reilly referred to several aspects of it.  Every day of the week issues arise regarding the health service.  This morning Deputy Gilmore, our party leader, raised the withdrawal of new services for the homeless.  That is an absolute scandal.  Every day of the week issues like this arise about the delivery of health services and how this affects the most vulnerable patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">We should not try to fix what is not broken.  We should not interfere with the relationship between community pharmacists and their patients.  Above all, we should not have this kind of unilateral process without negotiation which will go ahead next March unless the Minister intervenes.  There is general agreement among people on all sides of the House in terms of wanting this matter to be dealt with by the independent body through negotiation and by agreement.  That can be done and it need not take a long time.  It can be done in a month or two.  There is a need for goodwill on the side of the Government and on the side of the Health Service Executive, and I appeal to the Minister to exercise that goodwill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_177">
          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_363">I strongly support the Labour Party spokesperson on health and others who have asked that people stand back and allow the independent body to have a clean slate to make a contribution that will endure and that will protect, in particular, the social role of pharmacists.  In the few minutes remaining I can only list a few issues that I think are important.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The social role of pharmacists is important and it is affected by the diversity of supply.  When deregulation was first mooted the case that was made was based on the importance of allowing young pharmacists into a profession for which they were highly qualified.  Young pharmacists who came in at that time, however — this was revealed in the 26% increase figure referred to by the Minister — had to borrow heavily from banks and lending agencies to go into business.  One of its internal contradictions is that deregulation in itself is defeated when it leads to concentration of ownership.  If one drives on deregulation to a point of concentration of ownership at the cost of diversity of producers and suppliers, in effect, one is sweeping the ground from under the social role of pharmacists and endangering the professional capacity of young pharmacists who came into the business.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">It is not correct to say that the Competition Authority has the rights to which the Minister referred.  There were two possible interpretations of the Competition Authority's role, which stands like an <i>eminence grise</i> on this issue.  The first relates to section 4 of the Competition Act, especially in the light of the Fennelly judgment in the Supreme Court decision on the case appealed by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  That decision explicitly recognised the right of the Irish League of Credit Unions to represent its members on general policy.  No restriction arises except in the case of decisions on price in such a way as would lead to a potential abuse of a dominant position.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The Health Service Executive is entirely wrong in arguing against the right of collective representation.  The most recent case in European law is the Laval case which, while it held in favour in regard to the economic side, was not welcomed by many.  It established the right of collective representation as a fundamental right.  The Health Service Executive is going down a dangerous cul-de-sac in trying to suggest that in section 4 it has some right to strike at collective representation.  This will arise in the case of the contract with dentists and with vets <i>vis-à-vis </i>the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and it is simply wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">The former Attorney General, Mr. Byrne, later Commissioner Byrne, also made another fundamental point in a lecture to the UCD law society some years ago when he suggested that any body, such as the Health Service Executive, to which powers had been transferred, needed an envelope of clear policy directions on the part of the Minister.  He stated that the Minister could not divest himself or herself of existing powers and responsibilities.  I suggest the Health Service Executive has two issues.  The first relates to whether it has the right to use budgeting in such a way as interferes with the statutory floor to which citizens are entitled in the Health Acts.  It does not.  The second interpretation I suggested was that regarding section 4 of the Competition Act.  I provided an opportunity for clarification on this when I produced a Private Members' Bill.  The Government is reviewing the operation of the Competition Authority.  If it had wanted to bring forward proposals it could have, but it did not.  Neither has it fulfilled the Taoiseach's commitment that this issue would be solved in the early stages of the talks between the social partners.  The tragedy of this shambles is that on a bogus reasoning that stopped it concluding negotiations with the wholesalers, the HSE is trying to drive back through the pharmacists something it failed to address with the wholesalers.  I strongly support what my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and others have suggested, that we give the independent body the best chance it has by asking it to do what Indecon suggested.  I state this factually.  If one interprets its report, Indecon suggested the Government deal with the entire situation together, but that is not done by laying down a condition and saying anything can be discussed once the pharmacists have conceded on the fundamental principle.  It is time we examined all these issues in terms of the role of the Parliament, the Minister, citizens and the guarantees from them.  In taking up the reports of outside bodies such as Indecon, let us be true to Indecon and give the independent body the best chance.  Above all let us try to do this because of the anxiety those who need medicines are being put through.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_373">The primary reason this issue is being dealt with in this format — statements — is that the overwhelming majority of Government Deputies would not want a division on it today.  That is regrettable because from working with many of them and speaking to several of them privately I know they hold the same views as voices that will be heard from the Opposition benches in the course of this opportunity.  Since the resumption of the Dáil after the summer recess last year we have demanded that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, seriously address the escalating and critical situation threatening community pharmacies.  We have called for this matter to be addressed in the Dáil in plenary session, yet it is only now, as the 1 March deadline looms, that these statements and questions to follow have been scheduled.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">The Joint Committee on Health and Children has dealt with this matter in detail, meeting over three days recently and hearing detailed submissions followed by a question and answer session with both the HSE and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, IPU.  The committee requested that the Minister attend in advance of those hearings but she did not comply.  The committee requested that the Minister attend in advance of the 1 March deadline, but again she did not comply.  I see this as shirking her responsibility and accountability to the Oireachtas for a serious situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The escalating pharmacy dispute has been a cause of worry and uncertainty to tens of thousands of patients, especially elderly medical card patients.  It has created concern for all users of our health system, whether medical card patients or those dependent on the drugs payment scheme.  I have seldom seen an issue which has led to such extensive and prolonged lobbying of Deputies yet which, in contrast, has featured relatively little in the news media.  Perhaps it is because the details of the dispute are complex.  Nonetheless it is unfortunate that it has not received the attention it deserves.  A more general airing of the issues might have contributed to a solution before now.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The single most aggravating factor in the dispute has been the adherence of the Government and the HSE to the line that they cannot negotiate financial issues with the IPU, allegedly because of the Competition Act.  This, more than anything else, has led to the current impasse.  The Minister and her colleagues in Government must bear full responsibility for this.  They have made no effort to address the legal difficulty by means of their own legislation.  Although it is within the Minister's gift to address this, she has opposed the Competition (Amendment) Bill put forward by Deputy Higgins.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">I previously raised other very negative consequences of this interpretation of the Competition Act.  They include the blocking of negotiations with dentists on publicly funded dental schemes.  Many dentists have withdrawn from the scheme as a result and patients have been left without dental services.  This has received even less public notice than the pharmacy dispute but it is no less serious.  Age Action Ireland, in commenting on the pharmacy dispute, has pointed out that the dispute with dentists has been ongoing for over a year with many older people forced to go without a service, change dentists if they can find one still in the scheme or attend already over-stretched and under-resourced HSE dental clinics.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">If the imposition of new scales of payment for pharmacies goes ahead on 1 March and the IPU withdraws from the medical card and drugs payment schemes, tens of thousands of patients will be adversely affected.  The HSE tells us it believes relatively few pharmacists will withdraw.  That remains to be seen.  There was no need for the Minister and the HSE to escalate the dispute in this way.  The IPU welcomed the announcement by the Minister that an independent body would be established to review the contract issues between the HSE and the pharmacists.  In welcoming the announcement the IPU had asked the Minister and the HSE to avoid making unilateral changes to existing payment arrangements pending the outcome of an agreed independent review.  The Minister and the HSE carried on regardless.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">In all of this there is no dispute about the fact that we require better value for money for drug purchases in the health service.  Prices are far too high but the question must be asked why it took so long for the Government to address this matter and why it has been done in such a ham-fisted manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">On today's Order of Business I referred to the fact that on the eve of the 14 February meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children the Cathaoirleach, Deputy Moloney, who is with us in the Chamber, circulated a motion which was set to receive all-party support at the meeting the next day.  Deputy Reilly also alluded to it in the course of these statements.  I wish to read the motion and hear the Minister's response.  The Cathaoirleach of the committee presented four specific points as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_381">That no changes be made to contracts between the HSE and community pharmacists in advance of the setting up, and reporting, of an independent body whose remit will be to make recommendations on the reimbursement to pharmacists for drugs supplied under the State's community drugs schemes, in consultation with the interests concerned;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_382">that the committee</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_383">recognises the vital role that community-based pharmacies play in the delivery of the health service;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_384">further recognises that the proposed changes to the contracts between the HSE and the pharmacies should be designed to allow financial sustainability;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_385">and that no changes in the current contract or remuneration will take place until such a body reports and likewise pharmacists will refrain from any reduction in services.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I believed then, and said so at committee, and I still believe that encompassed in that motion for which I commended the Cathaoirleach of the committee, was the basis of a solution.  However, at the meeting on 14 February the Cathaoirleach withdrew this motion and the Fianna Fáil committee members proposed a bland motion simply calling on the HSE and the IPU to resolve the dispute.  They divided the committee in order to pass this motion, and the Government spurned another opportunity to help resolve the dispute.  The committee had previously been of one voice on this issue.  It defies credulity that the committee would find itself divided at that critical point.  That raises many questions, which are not for the Cathaoirleach to answer in the first instance, although I have no doubt that he will address the matter.  Why was the sensibly constructed motion not put before the committee members and the opportunity given for unanimous endorsement on 14 February?</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Looking on at all of this are patients who fear that their access to vital medication will be disrupted from 1 March.  The IPU claims that ultimately the changes to be brought in by the HSE on 1 March could result in the closure of more than 300 pharmacies, with smaller and more rural-based pharmacies worst affected.  Age Action Ireland has pointed to the rising concern among older people about  how they will get their medication.  The group has urged all sides to come together to assure older people that there is a contingency plan and, no matter how this dispute develops, they will continue to receive their medication.  Age Action Ireland has stated it is particularly concerned that any such contingency plan would be sufficient to meet the needs of older people living in rural areas, where there are already fewer pharmacies.  Such a contingency plan will not work if it involves older people in rural areas having to travel long distances to fill their prescriptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The IPU has welcomed the call from Age Action Ireland for both sides to come together to deal with the situation.  The IPU states it believes there is still time to resolve the issue and representatives have made themselves available for talks with the HSE.  I urge the Minister and the HSE to avail of that opportunity without delay.  The IPU has called for a comprehensive review of current payments to pharmacists by an independent body and that no cuts in payment be made until that body has made a recommendation on this issue.  The IPU has agreed to work with the HSE to agree contingency arrangements to deal with circumstances which may arise after this weekend, if the HSE proceeds to force through its plans from Saturday.  Everything must be done to ensure that there will be no necessity to put such contingency plans into operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">These issues need to be resolved by agreement and with the aims of ensuring continuity of service to patients, as well as better value for money in the purchase of medicines by the health services.  These expectations are not mutually exclusive, as we can address them both.  The financial aspects of this are quite complex, but it has been the absence of direct dialogue and negotiation on the generality and the detail of the issue that has led to this impasse.  For that, the Government must bear a large share of responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Pharmacies play a vital role in the primary care system, but the current system is fundamentally flawed because the so-called public and private mix so lauded by this and previous Administrations is inequitable and inefficient.  In theory, it involves individual HSE contracts with hundreds of pharmacists around the State.  These vary in size from small independent outlets to multinational chains.  As with GP services and the medical card scheme, I firmly believe that the current system should be replaced by a fully public primary care system, with free care to all at the point of delivery, based on need alone.  The complex public and private system leads to difficulties such as those now convulsing the pharmacy sector, albeit difficulties unnecessarily exacerbated by this Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_392">However, this is not the only part of our primary care sector in severe difficulty.  I already referred to the virtual collapse of the free dental scheme, while much more serious is the rapidly emerging shortage of GPs.  We have an aging general population and an aging GP population, with older doctors retiring and not enough younger doctors coming on stream to replace them.  There are major problems with the medical card scheme as older doctors retire and their complement of medical card patients, many of them elderly, are placed temporarily on another doctor's panel, and they then must find a new doctor to take them on.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">These are all crises either occurring at the moment or looming on the horizon.  They are wider issues which will become increasingly important, but they are all relevant to the pharmacy dispute.  They are part of the pattern of totally inadequate and often diminishing services for patients as a direct result of bad policy pursuit and bad management.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I have made many appeals to the Minister in this House over the past 11 years and I have concluded that it is a futile pursuit.  She clearly has a closed mind and a cold heart where health equality is concerned.  Therefore, I must instead appeal to the Fianna Fáil backbenchers and to whomever they trust in Cabinet.  I also urge the Green Party Members and Independent Deputies, such as Deputy McGrath and others, who support the Government to act in unison——</p>

          <p eId="para_400">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to allow me to speak on this important issue.  All Deputies in the House support and appreciate the work of our local pharmacists and staff.  We commend and value their efforts.  Pharmacies deliver on a very important part of our health service that works, but now pharmacists feel they are being shafted by HSE senior management.  The members of the IPU feel that the HSE is undermining the ability of pharmacists to provide us all with medicines under the Government schemes.  We in this House and the HSE have a responsibility to deal with this high cost issue, especially for patients.  However, I will not take any guff from the senior management of the HSE about efficiency and cost savings.  I stress that I am talking about the senior management, not the staff who are doing an excellent job, often against the odds.  The senior management of the HSE has squandered taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I always look for value for money for taxpayers and for the protection of our citizens, but I will also fight for a quality pharmacy service that members of the IPU provide.  I challenge those who try to damage the good name and integrity of the IPU.  Its members provide a quality service and they deserve our support, which they will get in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Like many of my colleagues, I have been lobbied by patients and local pharmacies.  Mr. Michael Pyne MPSI, from Costello's pharmacy in Marino wrote to me and stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_403">It is with deep concern that I write to you at this time.  The HSE is refusing to engage with an agreed independent process to facilitate the drawing up of a new contract between the HSE and local independent pharmacies.  The HSE has issued to this pharmacy a proposal that will have a devastating impact on the service levels, staffing levels and opening hours we provide to this community at present.  This is why I am appealing to you all at this time to help me protect Costello's Pharmacy from the HSE.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_404">Cathal, Kate, Margaret, Denisa and I work hard to keep this pharmacy open 65 hours a week and provide the highest levels of general advice and pharmacy care to each and every person who comes through the door.  The proposed action which the HSE is due to introduce on March 1st 2008 will in my opinion seriously undermine these services and the jobs of the people that are employed there. This is our community resource.  Please help me to keep it open.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Many Deputies will have received hundreds of similar letters.  Our local pharmacy provides vital services for our community, dispensing medicine, personal care, reinsurance and expert medical advice.  The pharmacist knows the people in our community and takes care of them.  This service, which cannot be replaced once it has been lost, is vital for the health care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I urge the parties involved to show common sense, have open minds and engage in independent arbitration.  Above all, I urge support for the excellent service provided by pharmacies and for the patients in our health service.</p>

While I had hoped to speak on the proposals, I propose to give a brief outline of the position of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on the issue.  The joint committee spent considerable time discussing pharmacy regulation and I invited the Health Service Executive and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to make presentations.  A meeting with delegations from both bodies lasted for four hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I was surprised to hear praise heaped on me by Deputy Ó Caoláin.  I ascribed his comments to confusion.  Deputy Reilly then tried to create an impression that something sinister had taken place in the joint committee or among its Fianna Fáil members.

My explanation of events will again underline that the approach of the Fine Gael Party's spokesman on health is to try to find fault on every issue.  In his rush to criticise all aspects of health policy, he forgets what he agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Following its meeting with representatives of the IPU and HSE, the joint committee decided, as it had done for years before Deputy Reilly was elected to the House, to try to formulate a motion which would find cross-party agreement.

          <p eId="para_417">I will place the facts before the House.  The Fianna Fáil members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children decided to work with Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin to try to agree a motion.  Deputy Reilly forgot to read out three separate proposals that we, as a responsible group in the joint committee, tried to work towards.  For instance, he failed to mention the motion stating that we recognised that the proposed changes in the contract between the HSE and pharmacies should be designed to allow financial sustainability.  Deputy Reilly had a copy of that text.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The Deputy telephoned me on the relevant evening to find out whether the motion which had been issued in my name was the Fianna Fáil Party motion.  I made clear to him that this was not the case and, as he will be aware, I told him the next morning as we entered the committee room that I would clarify the issue at the start of the meeting.  I informed the members of the joint committee that the motion had been issued in error and the secretariat had mistakenly understood that the text was to be issued.  It was one of three possible motions and the Deputy accepted my explanation.  Today, however, he has tried to detract from the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_421">I commend the Minister for her contribution.  As a previous speaker noted, backbench Fianna Fáil Deputies are concerned.  We are concerned on the basis of two rumours making the rounds.  The position regarding the first, that pharmacists will be forced to sell below cost and at a loss, has been clarified by the Minister.  The worst rumour is that the HSE may drop some pharmacists from the contract, in other words, it will not renew their contracts.  The Minister has also clarified the position in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I commend the Minister for listening to those who have a genuine interest in sorting out this problem.  She has accepted the case that an independent group should examine both sides of the argument.  I have full confidence in the work of the independent body.  My concern is that Deputy Reilly and his party fear this process will result in the matter being resolved.</p>

This is, therefore, a major issue for my constituents.  I commend and support the Minister in her efforts to try to reduce the price of drugs.  My difficulty, however, is the manner in which the matter has been dealt with, particularly by the Health Service Executive.  Its approach to negotiating with pharmacists has been disappointing.  I accept the Minister's point on the restrictions arising from the Competition Act.  She has established an independent body which will report to her and has indicated she will make its proposals retrospective to 1 March.  In that case, why does she not defer the decision regarding the 1 March date until such time as the independent body issues its report?</p>

          <p eId="para_428">I have a difficulty with the statement made by the HSE in the joint committee and repeated by the Minister today that the contract does not change if pharmacists do not avail of the interim contract on 1 March.  Regardless of whether that is technically true, this statement gives the wrong impression because remuneration to pharmacists will be reduced by 8%, which is the reduction in the wholesale discount.  Fridge items, which constitute 10% of medicines dispensed, are not subject to a wholesale discount.  Does the Minister realise that many pharmacists are able to avail of the discount as a result of efficiencies they have introduced in their practices, such as paying their bills before being remunerated by the HSE?  Has she considered the savings that could be achieved under the high-tech scheme?  I believe as much as €15 million could be saved from the scheme's overall cost of €260 million.  While I acknowledge that the Minister is seeking savings of €100 million, must all these savings be made through a renegotiation of the pharmacy contract?</p>

        <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
          <p eId="para_429">I propose to share time with Deputy Crawford.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I find myself in the unusual position, although it has happened in the past, of agreeing with most of Deputy Flynn's contribution.  I even find myself in the astonishing position of agreeing with the departing Deputy Finian McGrath.  I can well understand the reason the Deputy expressed such enthusiasm for his local pharmacist.  It is because he knows he does not have to vote.  He is in the unique position on this issue in that, having failed to take the opportunity to vote with this side of the House to allow a meaningful motion to be passed, he has delivered a speech which has one objective, namely, that it will be copied and furnished to the pharmacist whose letter he cited.  I do not take seriously any of his contribution, whereas I take seriously Deputy Flynn's contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Deputies O'Sullivan, Reilly and Flynn came to the nub of the issue, which is one of industrial relations.  It is to do with addressing problems which require resolutions in a matter that does not maximise conflict but leads to a successful outcome in the public interest.  It is in the public interest to reduce the wholesale price of drugs.  It is an outrage that almost 18% is added to the manufacturing price by wholesalers.  I agree with everything the Minister stated about the cost of getting the product to the patient.  The problem is that pharmacists are caught in a difficulty the Minister has with the wholesalers.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">If an award were given for the capacity to conduct industrial relations in the most ham-fisted, asinine way it would go jointly to the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE.  They both have their hands on the chaos we have seen on this issue during the past six months.  Last Sunday the Oscars were awarded to those in the film industry and what are known as the "razzers" were awarded the previous night, the raspberry awards for the worst movies of the year.  If an award were to be conferred on the Minister or the HSE, they would be at the top of the "razzer" list.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Consider the dance that is being conducted on this issue.  There is a need to reduce the wholesale price of drugs.  The wholesalers convinced the Minister and the HSE that they cannot engage in discussions with them, with competition law cited as the major obstacle.  No attempt was made to get around that obstacle and to put in place a formula that would directly result in discussions involving the wholesalers to resolve this issue in a manner in which the retailers as pharmacists are caught in the middle.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The intention of the Shipsey process was to find a solution, but I am informed the HSE never came to the table or treated the Shipsey process seriously.  We then had discussions in this House involving an independent body, based on an understanding that normal industrial relations are conducted in dealing with conflict resolution.  This means a body would be appointed to engage with all sides and, in the public interest, would seek a solution which would then be implemented.  The exact antitheses of conducting good public relations and conflict resolution in the industrial area or any other area is that an independent body is appointed but a solution is imposed before the work of the independent body gets under way and it comes to a considered judgment on what is the solution.  That is why we are in the position in which we find ourselves today.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">It is of vital importance that those who require medicines continue to have access to them.  It is of vital importance that local pharmacists, who are held in high esteem by the local communities in which they operate continue to provide that service.  It is grossly unfair to them that they have been put in a position in which they feel they have been trapped, as Deputies Flynn and Reilly expressed well.  They are caught in the row between the Minister and the wholesalers.  That suits some groups of wholesalers because they control a certain number of pharmacies.  It is the independent pharmacies which are placed in the greatest of difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">It is not only rural pharmacies that are affected.  There are some urban, single pharmacies operating in communities which have a genuine concern about the economic position they will find themselves in with their staff if the Minister and the HSE impose an 8% reduction on reimbursement for medicines provided.  It would be difficult to make a greater hames of an important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I regret that the Government did not have the courage of its convictions to allow this issue to be addressed by way of a motion in the House.  It would provide for Members on the Government side who might wish to eloquently criticise the HSE, such as Deputy Finian McGrath, an opportunity to show the courage of their convictions, which I very much doubt he has any capacity to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I listened with amusement to Deputy John Moloney, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  In front of me I have a motion in his name which was tabled at that committee.  The first paragraph of the motion urges: "That no changes be made to contracts between the HSE and community pharmacists in advance of the setting up and reporting of an independent body, whose remit will be to make recommendations on the reimbursement to pharmacists for drugs supplied under the State's community drugs schemes, in consultation with the interests concerned."  That is an eminently sensible proposal and I can only assume that somewhere behind the scenes, Deputy Moloney had his bottom severely slapped politically and told to take that motion off the agenda for fear of causing embarrassment and focusing on the total incompetence of the manner in which the Government and the HSE have dealt with this issue.</p>

In the limited time available to me I wish to state that tens of thousands of elderly people and people with disabilities are desperately wondering from where they will get their medication in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The Minister is satisfied that there will be sufficient pharmacies to deal with the major issues, but I am thinking of places such as Emyvale in north Monaghan.  I am aware of the Minister's attitude to north Monaghan as far as the hospital is concerned and we do not want to lose any more.  We must consider the ordinary people.  For God's sake, at this late point will the Minister allow the arbitrator to decide what is right and how it should be done?  No group was ever asked to take a 50% cut because it is not possible to survive in those circumstances.  The Minister still has a couple of days.  The Taoiseach, the Minister and the HSE are all to blame for this.  They all stood idly by for three months and did nothing to solve the issue.  Now they are trying to impose something that is unworkable and unjust  and will cause great hardship to those who do not deserve it.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">I wish to focus on specific issues and I would appreciate it if the Minister would examine them.  The most commonly used medication products are those for diabetes, morphine and ostomy products.  I understand that the wholesale price of the insulin Lantus OptiSets — Deputy Reilly will probably correct my pronunciation — is €64.04 and the projected reimbursement of that is €58.92.  If 30 of those are sold in a month, which is standard in a small pharmacy, the new arrangements would mean a loss of €150.  The wholesale rate for ostomy bags — the reference no. is 28335 — is €127.59 while the reimbursement rate under the new scheme would be €117.38, some €20 in the difference.  A 30 milligram injection of morphine at wholesale rate is €15.99; the reimbursement rate under the new scheme, €14.71.  These are just three examples.  The more high-tech the drug, the larger the loss to the pharmacist.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Will the Minister ask the Dorgan group to examine the wholesale issue?  There is a lack of understanding as to the impact this will have at HSE level.  If we could expand the terms of reference for the Dorgan group to examine the wholesale issue and separate it from the fee-per-item, we will have done some service.  The projected fee of €5 per item is far too low.  I hope the Dorgan group will have the capacity to deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I have every confidence in Seán Dorgan.  When chief executive officer of IDA Ireland, he attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment; I found him to be frank and fair and not supinely supporting the Government line.  He will do a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The issue his group requires to give most analysis to is the number of young pharmacists who in recent years bought into pharmacies on the back of the 2002 reforms.  At that time, people were told there would be closures but it has been the opposite.  People who bought in on those reforms are in a difficult situation because of the overnight reform of this sector.  Specific attention must be given by Seán Dorgan to those who bought into pharmacies in the intervening period and the impact the proposed changes will have.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">It is regrettable that the work done at the health committee is being degraded in the Chamber.  I have seen how Deputy Moloney chairs meetings, many in difficult circumstances.  Long-serving Members have never seen any committee with such high attendance and participation.  Deputy Moloney chaired the meeting on the dispute and dealt with all issues, the IPU and the HSE fairly which was accepted by everyone involved.  It is unfortunate to see his efforts, done in the best interests of the House, being degraded in the interests of cheap political point-scoring.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">It is important the work of the committee is acknowledged.  I am chairman of the Fianna Fáil policy group.  I can look Deputy Reilly in the eye and admit most of my party colleagues have concerns about this issue.  The Minister for Health and Children knows that and is not unhappy if I express that.  I am not getting involved in HSE-bashing because it has a job to do.  It is important, however, for it to outline its views and give assurances in this dispute.  Constituents in Tallaght have told me they are concerned about the future of their local pharmacies.  They want access to not only the medicines they require but to the care and attention given to them by their pharmacists.  That is why I do not want to go Tesco to buy the few tablets I need.  I want to go to my local pharmacist.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Not to be parochial about my constituency, but there are communities in Tallaght in which pharmacists need help to survive.  I have had many discussions with the Minister for Health and Children on ensuring all communities have a pharmacist.  Fettercairn in Tallaght, a local authority estate of more than 6,000 people, has no pharmacy facilities.  There are communities — I do not want to single them out as disadvantaged — where pharmacists find it more difficult to survive than the larger stores.  All Members from urban and rural communities are finding the same challenges in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I am not getting into the argument of whether there needed to be a division on this matter rather than just statements.  I am sure all Members on this side would walk behind the Minister through the lobby.  To say otherwise is just nonsense.  The Minister cares about this issue.  However, it is important she understands we cannot abandon patients, communities and people depending on us to continue to make the point.  Whether it was a right decision to choose 1 March as the date for the changes, that is another day's work.  If another date had been chosen, we would probably have had the same challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">This is a live issue which people are talking about.  I do not yet know if Joe Duffy is going to talk about it but it is important, even at this late stage, to try to find a solution.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">The Minister referred to €100 million being a large amount of money.  That is much less than what has been wasted on PPARS or the €420 million on e-Government.  Government is about choices.  The Minister spoke about a fair deal for patients.  This new scheme for pharmacies is not a fair deal for patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">In 1970, under the Health Act, pharmacists took over the dispensing of community drugs from dispensary doctors.  The €100 million spent on the community pharmacy sector is good value for money.  Why has the Minister not examined generic products to reduce the cost instead of a rough blunt instrument?  The wholesalers will take no reduction and will be paid the exact same price.  This new scheme for the owner-managed pharmacies, which comprise the majority, will make it impossible for them.  The Minister cannot expect the pharmacists to take up the interim contract because they will lose the mark-up on DPS items.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Deputy Calleary made the point that Sean Dorgan is setting up an independent body.  He is a great man.  However, his terms of reference are confining.  He cannot consider the effect on community pharmacies.  He is confined to considering the dispensing fee.  His hands are tied.  Therefore, patients are suffering.  The Minister for Health and Children and her accomplices in the HSE have put PR and spin ahead of patient care.  It is nothing more and nothing less.  They can go around it any way they want but that is what they have done.  We are getting circulars daily from the HSE.</p>

          <p eId="para_486">My first question is to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney.  How can he suggest that the situation with wholesalers has been clarified by the Minister when the man who sat behind him only a few moments ago, Deputy Calleary, produced a letter from the wholesalers clearly pointing out that far from guaranteeing they would not have to charge more, they would do so, and in addition, they would not be able to supply drugs to some of their community pharmacists, especially the smaller rural ones, under the new arrangements at the cost suggested by the HSE?  It is a complete contradiction.  There was no clarification.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I have no intention of having any more rows with Deputy Moloney — that can take place at the health committee — but I will say the following.  We spent four or five hours at a very good meeting chaired excellently by Deputy Moloney.  I would be the first to put my hand up and say that.  We left the meeting with a clear understanding that we would meet the next morning to discuss a composite motion in private session.  A motion then appeared at my office.  I asked the Chairman if Fianna Fáil had agreed to it.  The Chairman said he did not have a problem with it but it had not been voted on by Fianna Fáil and he would have to see what happened at the committee.  That was fine.  Three minutes into that meeting we went from private session to public session and one Deputy said there should be no motion.  We spent another two hours in further discussion.  These are the facts of the matter.  It shows where we were coming from and how we moved so far away from the central issue.  The big question mark remains.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">The ruse by Deputy Finian McGrath to blame it all on the bad bold HSE, neglecting to mention that it is answerable to the Minister, whom he supports——</p>

Why is she ignoring the recommendations of the Indecon report commissioned by the HSE, which stated clearly that there should be no precipitate action, that the Irish market could not be compared with other markets in Europe and that an independent arbitration body should be set up, pending whose report no action should be taken?</p>

As a preliminary response I point out that in a developed country such as ours there is no group in society that does better than professionals.  I remember making this point four years ago during discussion of the legislation to establish the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The same criticisms were given, except that we were not dealing with patients but with clients.  I was being told that thousands of solicitors would go out of business, particularly in rural areas.  However, we know what happened.  Equally, the consequences being predicted here, which were predicted in 2002 when the former Minister, Deputy Martin, changed the regulations, and in 2005 when we published the legislation, will not come to pass.  Professionals will do well in a country such as ours where we are spending so much money.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">We want to negotiate a new contract and we want a flat fee for dispensing.  The expertise of pharmacists is dispensing medication.  It is crazy that we give pharmacists, through the DPS, a mark-up of 50% and a dispensing fee of €2.68, while they also get an 8% discount from the wholesalers which is not part of the contract between the State and the pharmacists.  That, as pointed out by the Brennan Commission, is crazy, and one does not need any studies to know it is not sustainable.  We want to pay pharmacists a flat fee for dispensing.  We want to pay them the same fee whether they are dispensing for the medical card scheme or the DPS.  That is fair.  Obviously there will be different arrangements for the high-tech schemes, which will be considered in the context of the new contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">What is happening now is a staging post on the way to a new contract.  A new contract with the pharmacists is what we really need.  We want to sit down and negotiate that contract as quickly as possible and then have it independently priced.  We are not allowed to do otherwise under competition law, notwithstanding what the Deputies have said.  Competition is good for markets, good for consumers and, in this case, good for patients.  We cannot have innovation if we do not have competition.  We have to adhere to competition law.  We can resolve our difficulties in the context of a new contract, which will, it is to be hoped, involve a more developmental role for pharmacists in the health care system.</p>

If that had been agreed, we would have a much stronger hand with the Minister today and she would have had to listen to the combined voice of the Oireachtas.  Unfortunately that is not what happened.  Nevertheless, I do not want the record to be incorrect.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">Is it true that €100 million is being taken from the money that is paid directly to pharmacists?  How will the Minister ensure that the money does not remain absent and is somehow or other transferred to wholesalers?</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I also have a copy of the letter sent by my Limerick colleague, although not my party colleague, former Minister of State Deputy Tim O'Malley.  Mr. O'Malley states: "If the changes go ahead as scheduled on March 1, it is my opinion that the implications for our national delivery of pharmaceutical services will be nothing less than catastrophic".  Does the Minister agree with that?  How will she ensure that small community pharmacists who have taken out large loans can stay in business if this goes through on 1 March?</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_270" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">

          <p eId="para_522">Mr. Tim O'Malley's letter was sent to me last night but has not appeared in the newspapers today.  He must have sent it to the Deputies opposite.  I do not agree with the letter — he is a pharmacist.  Mr. O'Malley and I have never agreed on this issue.  When the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, removed the restriction in 2002 Mr. O'Malley used similar language to me.  He also did so when the 2005 legislation was published.  When one is involved as a professional one cannot be as objective as others.  My responsibility is to ensure better value for money for patients and taxpayers and that we have a viable and vibrant pharmacy business.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Pharmacists are paid for the entire process.  Their fees were €367 million last year and this will not change.  It is €100,000 higher in terms of fees than in Northern Ireland, with the caveats I included earlier about different jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">There is no change in the fees.  Our contract with pharmacists concerns their fees.  The Dorgan group will consider a flat fee for service.  Of course pharmacists can argue and articulate the impact that changes will have on them.  They can make their case to a group of fair-minded citizens who have available to them the expertise they need.  We want to move away from a situation where the more expensive drugs are, the more it costs to dispense them.  The mark-up and the discounts are not sustainable or fair and no fair-minded person could argue against that.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I cannot tell the Deputies that every pharmacist in the country will remain open.  A pharmacy on Grafton Street, perhaps the busiest street in the country, closed last year.  I cannot guarantee anyone's business, nor could any government.  Pharmacists know how to run their businesses, I do not know how to run a pharmacy.  I am very confident that, notwithstanding these changes, we will have a vibrant pharmacy sector.  The major beneficiaries will be pharmacies heavily dependent on GMS, where there will be a fee of at least €5, increased from €3.26 at present.  The other beneficiaries will be pharmacies in rural areas with small volumes.  There is no doubt these pharmacies will gain, something that is important to me.  I am confident that pharmacists on which medical card patients, sicker people, poorer people and older people are dependent will do better with a flat fee.</p>

If any Deputy can tell me of a market in the world where it costs €600 million in order to get €1 billion of product to the patient, I would be very surprised.  It is not credible that getting our drugs, which cost €1 billion on the community side, to our patients should cost €600 million.  Some €100 million will be removed from the €600 million.  That will facilitate a 7% margin of 5% for their business with 2% profit, which is highly lucrative.  In Northern Ireland, after £180,000 the wholesale margin is 4%.  In a contract recently awarded by the HSE for the supply of vaccines, I understand the winning company tendered at a margin of 4%.  These are margins on which people can make profits but it is not acceptable that taxpayers and patients must pay a hugely inflated price for medicine as a result of the way we remunerate pharmacies.</p>

How many medical card holders and drug payment scheme dependants will be on this list of losers forecast by the Minister?  Is there an analysis of the numbers of people who will have their current arrangements significantly displaced?  What contingency arrangements have been considered, as requested by Age Action Ireland, representing older people, so that older people can access monthly or weekly prescriptions where pharmacies are forced to close or withdraw from the medical card and drug payment scheme?  What consideration has the Minister and her colleagues in Cabinet given to the core issue for many Deputies?  We have registered agreement on the need for a restructuring of the payment for medicines, which we all recognise as far too high.  What address has the Minister given to the potential to legislatively overcome the block created by the Competition Act and the manner in which it affects engagement between the HSE and the IPU and the HSE and the Irish Dental Association, IDA?  Is it within the gift of the Government to overcome the obstacle to ensure proper representative negotiation between the respective union associations, the representative bodies named?</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Before Deputy Moloney leaves the Chamber I wish to refer to the motion read to members at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on 13 February.  Much has been made of it by different speakers.  Nobody is attacking anyone but we are trying to establish why that motion did not become the substantive motion on 14 February as, in the view of this and other Deputies, it had the potential to move the situation forward.  Is the Minister aware why the motion did not present itself on 14 February?  Within its text it had the potential to unlock the difficulties.</p>

          <p eId="para_537">The Deputy asked many questions, including who will be the losers.  I first wish to identify the winners because that is important.  The winners will be patients, who will receive the medicine cheaper, and taxpayers.  The other winners will be pharmacists heavily dependent on medical card patients and pharmacists located in areas where the volume of business is lower.  I cannot identify individually who will be losers but clearly those who have high volumes of business and receive large discounts will lose.  So too will the wholesalers.  I do not know the business arrangements between wholesalers and pharmacists in respect of who pays what.  What I am concerned about is the contract the State has with the retail pharmacy sector and the community pharmacists to supply medication to patients.  I am satisfied that what is happening this weekend will not impact on the State's capacity to provide a service to patients throughout the country.  With regard to contingency, the HSE has a free telephone number on which it has taken between 200 and 220 calls from patients and been able to reassure them.  In the event that somebody cannot get their medication, the HSE has assured me that medication will be brought to them.</p>

Pharmacists take their ethical duties seriously.  Unlike in the case of methadone, where one is not required to give three months notice to break a contract, under the contract the State has with pharmacists a three month notice period is required.  There will be no cash crisis on Saturday and no issues with the payment of staff.  We cannot justify postponing the high margin paid to the wholesaler until the Dorgan group reports.  There are two separate issues here.</p>

The representatives of the IPU in their meeting with me two weeks ago said that the €5 flat fee, and the HSE has said not less than €5, is not sufficient and that it was not devised, in their view, through an independent process.  It was to address that issue that I decided to establish the group chaired by Mr. Sean Dorgan to examine it in the context of these changes.  It will be a matter for the IPU and others to make their case to that group regarding the fee.  The group will make its report.  There are no limitations on the group and we have given a commitment, subject to Government approval, that any advice or recommendations will be backdated to 1 March.</p>

          <p eId="para_543">I am a strong fan of competition.  I am old enough to remember when there was no competition in certain markets.  Protectionism protects nobody and certainly not consumers.  Society does better when there is fair competition.  Furthermore, these markets are regulated.  There are regulatory bodies and the recent legislation provides, for the first time, for the regulation of the corporate entities in addition to the pharmacists.  That has been broadly welcomed by pharmacists.  We have legislated to tackle the conflict of interest between prescribing and dispensing which was, again, an issue of huge concern to pharmacists.  To be fair, the Government has done a great deal to develop the pharmacy profession, in particular to allow our pharmacists to open pharmacies in this country, which previously they could not do if they had not graduated here.</p>

          <p eId="para_547">I have three questions.  Why does the Minister treat the pharmacists in a different way from how she treated the medical consultants?  Why did she spend many hours over almost four years going through the arbitration system to ensure that they were happy with what was to be implemented?  With the pharmacists, the Minister chose the jackboot and only used an arbitrator, Mr. Dorgan, after the event.  They cannot understand it.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The HSE told the last meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children that the wholesalers had bought into this scheme.  However, I received a letter, through Deputy Calleary, from United Drug which clearly demonstrates that is not the case.  They never gave such a commitment.  How can medical card holders and pharmacists trust anything the HSE does after this?  I share the view that we must get better value for money.  The Minister spoke about the losers but we all know the losers will be the people at the bottom — the small pharmacies throughout the country and the people who will have to beg to get what they are due with their medical cards.  Of course, given the Progressive Democrats' philosophy, the Minister will not be too worried about that.</p>

Was the Minister impressed by some of the people who made representations?  Many Members are in politics long enough to know when people are genuine, and there is a genuine fear on the part of some small pharmacies that they will go out of business with the introduction of this new scheme.  As other Members have said, and I commend the Minister and the HSE in this regard, we must make savings but there is a fear, and we cannot ignore it, that we could create a situation that will result in large pharmacy chains and the end of small pharmacies.  Were any studies undertaken by the Department to assess the impact on pharmacies of the introduction of the proposed new scheme?  If there were such studies, what did they show to be the results of that impact?</p>

They are not elderly pharmacists working into their 80s but a second generation of young pharmacists who have taken on massive mortgages to finance their entry into this business.  Have any studies been conducted on the age profile of pharmacists?  These people have been given loans on the basis of projected income from their pharmacy businesses.  What is to become of them?</p>
          <p eId="para_555">It is not just about the General Medical Services scheme and medical cards, but about providing a service in the community.  The number of people with medical cards is being cut back each year.  Where are people to get their medication if pharmacies close down?  The Minister is correct that she is not a fool but we are not fools either.  If €100 million is taken out of the service, somebody will suffer.  Who are they and what is their age profile?</p>

Her last comment was that the 8% had nothing to do with their contract.  If the 8% discount from the wholesaler is not related to the pharmacists contract, why is the HSE involved in any negotiation about that aspect?  Are we trying to force the IPU, on behalf of the pharmacists, to negotiate through an independent body with the wholesalers?  Is that our objective with this?</p>

          <p eId="para_558">The HSE cannot negotiate with the wholesalers.  Is it the case that the Minister believes the pharmacists, on their own behalf, should negotiate with the wholesalers?  Is it fair that the HSE should cut the pharmacists' 8% until that happens?  I am trying to understand the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Second, the Minister mentioned that because of a deal made with the manufacturers she believes we are now in a better situation than if pharmacists were actually prescribing generic drugs.  The Minister probably does not have it to hand but has she independent evidence of this that does not originate from the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association?  If so, she should circulate it.  It is an important point.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">With regard to the discount, it is acknowledged that some pharmacists get a 2% discount, while others get a 14% discount.  The Minister has said that no pharmacists will be worse off and they will not get any less than the cost of the drugs to them.  In practical terms, how is this going to work?  If I am getting a 2% discount and the price is being cut by 8%, the Minister will have to make up that differential of 6%.  However, if I am getting a 4% discount, the differential is only 4%.  Is it the case that pharmacists all over the country will be on a different price?  How will that be administered?  Is it fair that the HSE should benefit from discounts pharmacists get from wholesalers because they pay their bills promptly but do not get reimbursed by the HSE for 90 days?  If  pharmacists pay their bill after 60 or 30 days or immediately, they get a discount of 1% for each of those days.  Is it fair that the HSE should recoup the benefit of that, when a young pharmacist may be paying the bill out of a bank overdraft facility?  Pharmacists have built efficiencies into their business by ordering in bulk and improving their software and computer systems.  Is it right that the benefits of  such investment by individual pharmacists in their businesses should be taken away by the HSE?</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_637">I welcome the publication of the Student Support Bill and commend the Minister and her Department on finally bringing it to fruition.  As we move to a transfer of grants from the county councils to the VECs, we should acknowledge the role the councils have played over many years in the distribution and management of the student grant system, particularly council officials who brought a fair degree of sense and sensitivity to that role.  I wish to acknowledge that and wish them well as they move on to different responsibilities.  The VEC sector has proved itself to be very successful and careful in the management of student grants.  The VECs will bring the same level of sensibility and sensitivity to their new role of managing grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">There was much discussion in last night's debate about whether the issuing of student grants should be centralised in one body.  I have severe concerns regarding those proposals.  We have just spent the last few hours discussing an issue that is being handled by a centralised body and that body has not come out of it particularly well.  Centralisation takes away a little bit of local cop-on and local knowledge.  It also takes away some of the sensibility and sensitivity to which I referred earlier.  The issuing of grants is best left and managed at local VEC level.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">There was also some discussion last night about student loans for students who do not qualify for grants.  Some Members proposed the introduction of a student loan system, albeit a subsidised one.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that this measure would be wrong.  Anyone who knows students from the UK or other countries where student loan systems are in place knows the pressure to repay loans upon leaving college, a pressure that continues into the former students' mid-30s and restricts their ability to get mortgages and other loans for cars, businesses, etc.  The loan system leaves a student with a millstone around his or her neck for many years.  In a republic, education is a basic right.  Were more money available, it would be fitting to improve our grant system, particularly at the basic level, but a student loan system is not the way to go given the example of other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">I congratulate the Higher Education Authority on its website, <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i>.  For the first time, there is a single point at which people can see the myriad of available grants, their entitlements and the qualifying criteria.  The HEA has done a good service in equipping, staffing and putting the website on-line.  I encourage the HEA to make more use of the website in publicising the grants, perhaps by linking it with the CAO form — in the June-August period, we are all asked questions that can now be answered on-line — and to put extra resources into the website’s promotion.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">During yesterday's debate, people took the chance to comment on general third level issues.  While there have been significant improvements since my time in college, and I acknowledge the work done in DCU in particular, college life is not all about lectures and degrees.  It is also about the level to which one gets involved in the community, be it through student unions or societies.  For those of us who had the privilege and luck to get involved, many of the skills we learned are those that we remember today, not necessarily what we learned during lectures.  DCU's model involves giving credits at degree level for people who get involved.  If we can get students involved in voluntary and community activities at that age, albeit in a college scenario, it would be easier to sustain the level of involvement as they enter the working world and return to their communities.  We are fed up discussing in the House the collapse in volunteerism.  We must approach our trapped audience, as it were, and encourage its members to get involved at student level.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">I congratulate the authorities of Trinity College on their recent programme for people with intellectual disabilities, the reporting of which was fantastic.  Seeing people who would heretofore not have got inside the door at Trinity College being acknowledged and awarded degrees was welcome.  Every other college should take this example on board and consider involving people with intellectual disabilities in a greater way.  Those who do not have such disabilities would learn much more from liaising and working on a daily basis with the people in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Yesterday, there was a great deal of discussion on how the abuse of alcohol affects day-to-day society.  Yesterday morning, independent evidence in further reports showed that we have a major problem.  A related issue can be found at college level where the marketing emphasis is on going out several times per week and drinking heavily.  We are diverting a number of resources into teenager alcohol programmes through secondary schools and youth clubs and funding has been provided to a number of non-alcoholic initiatives at youth level, but there is a tendency to see it as people's responsibility or fault once they turn 18 years of age and that we should not worry about them.  We spend money on alcohol therapy centres for the want of spending money on marketing campaigns aimed at students and people aged 18-20 years.  We must use colleges to a greater degree to educate people in this regard.  We must work with the colleges on a health screening programme in respect of the damage alcohol can do.  At that age, one does not consider the damage alcohol does to one's system or the effect it may have later in life, but the centres at which tens of thousands of young people study can be used to promote this message.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">As a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, colleges and student communities should be used to further the climate change agenda.  The green flags programme at national school level, which we all know, is expanding to secondary school level.  It is a fantastic programme and is the only matter in respect of which I agree with An Taisce, but there should be an ability to engage individual college faculties in a similar programme.  The green schools programme at national school level will have addressed much of the lack of environmental responsibility by the time the current generation reaches our age.  I have less faith in our age group learning to change our behaviour, but if we can start trapping those of us immediately behind us — those in college — and using their college experiences to engage them in their personal responsibilities to address climate change, it would be a worthwhile initiative.  Daily, the House addresses a range of issues, but we do not utilise students in this respect or avail of the fact that they comprise a captive audience to which we could send our message or with which we could engage to hear their opinions.  As we proceed, this matter should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">There is ongoing discussion in respect of raising institutes of technology to university level.  I acknowledge the debate and work that is occurring at Waterford Institute of Technology.  In the debate on university status, it would be dangerous to undermine the role of the ITs.  They provide a specific range of education that focuses on business and careers and offers a range of courses that a university might not necessarily provide.  Last night, a university for the midlands was called for and received a commitment from the other side of the House.  Deputy Brian Hayes was not in the Chamber when the call was made, but the idea of throwing university status around like confetti is dangerous and undermines the fantastic work being down at IT level.  Before attaining university status, much work would need to be done.  The IT sector has provided a significant and improved service since regional technical colleges became ITs and we should keep as many of them as ITs and in their specific roles as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">For many years, we have been well served by colleges and the second level that got people into college.  However, we must move to meet current world demands, particularly in respect of fourth level education.  In my time at college, a minority continued on to do the doctorates and masters that are now in demand internationally.  We must engage students earlier to get them involved and interested in fourth level degrees.  Many secondary schools have systems in place, albeit informally, to identify good students and to send them to third level.  A similar system should be put in place at third level to attract students who may have something to offer at fourth level.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">In terms of career and job advice, we must invest further resources at second and third levels.  We must put a mechanism in place whereby we can encourage people and foster intellect, particularly to move people into the PhD area.  Unless we do so, we will fall behind as a world economy and experience further job losses.  I acknowledge the level of investment by the Ministers for Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputies Hanafin and Martin, to encourage people to undertake PhDs.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">We owe third level institutions a great debt for feeding into various activities at national and international levels, which have added to Ireland's allure as a destination.  Given all of the people who have passed through the third level sector in fields such as literature, sport, medicine and so on, our small country of just over 4 million people is consistently and constantly producing excellence in a varied and expanding range.  Our third level sector has responded to this demand by expanding the range of courses on offer to a wider range of students.  The range of courses now on offer in all third level institutions is phenomenal; many of them were not dreamed of when I attended a third level institution and that was not long ago.  Every taste is now catered for.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">The opportunity cost of not attending college was spoken of yesterday.  The choice facing people is either to go to college, get an apprenticeship or start working.  The success of our economy in recent years has meant that many people chose to go straight into full-time employment; that work has now dried up for some, for whatever reason, and such people are left without a qualification.  I ask the Minister to find out how many people are in such a situation, particularly those who went into highly-paid, cash in hand construction jobs who are now without employment and without qualifications.  We should target such people for third level education, whether the goal be a trade, a degree or a diploma, so that they will be qualified to join the workforce that is demanded.  People who took what was the easy option at the time are now coming to our constituency offices seeking assistance.  Those who go to college miss out on a few years but they are ultimately well compensated for them in terms of the salaries they can earn.  We must pay particular attention to people who left the education system in recent years after the leaving certificate and are now, to an extent, abandoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">It is unbelievable that people nowadays still leave school at junior certificate level, given that everyone knows a leaving certificate, at least, is required in the workplace.  With regard to entering the job market, the bar has been raised from holding a leaving certificate to holding a third level qualification.  We must add extra resources at junior certificate level to ensure nobody leaves school at that point without having a career or education path designed for him or her.  This could be done on a one-to-one basis because relatively few people leave school at this point.  We owe an educational path to every school-leaver to ensure he or she is not lost in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The VEC sector, which is moving into a prime role in the administration of grants, is something we should pay tribute to.  VECs work due to a fantastic combination of knowledge, qualifications and experience in teachers, educationalists and elected representatives.  VEC schools around the country are a credit to their respective VECs, through boards of management, elected representatives, parents and teaching staff.  It is a model we should protect and expand and I know it will sustain the grants system.  I am concerned by suggestions that we should centralise the grants system as this would be a retrograde step that would result in the late payment of grants, the loss of local knowledge to the grant appeals system and students losing out.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">I welcome the publication of the Bill, I congratulate the Minister on bringing it to this stage and I look forward to supporting it in this House.</p>

          <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_653">I am pleased to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  I note the Government promised in June 2002 that "we will introduce a payment of maintenance grants through a unified and flexible grant payment system" and I welcome the late arrival of the Bill.  Many of us have called for this legislation for some time and I hope it will progress through the Houses of the Oireachtas quickly and, more importantly, that it is put into practice quickly.  It is important that we see the benefits of this legislation as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">I agree with the previous speaker that education is vital to our society and economy and one could say that investment in education in the 1960s marked a turning point.  As a previous speaker said, the advent of the institutes of technology made a huge difference to the State.  Support from the European Union at the time, which ploughed a lot of money into the sector, meant we had graduates available when they were needed.  In my area of the country there are many pharmaceutical companies and the like and the availability of top-level graduates from our third level institutions is one of the main reasons they set up in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">In this time of increased competition we must ensure we continue to invest in education at all levels and see that no student is forced to drop out of the education system for financial reasons.  We must also ensure that students in school and college are not under stress due to a lack of finance.  Ultimately, our investment in education is paid back to the economy many times when graduates gain employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">I am worried that we have not kept up with the schools building programme at second level and primary level.  Deputies table questions every day asking when certain schools will get an extension and, as a former teacher, I know the learning environment is very important.  The primary school curriculum is exciting and imaginative and I congratulate those who devised it and develop it all the time but children must have space in which to move around and learn.  If children are in cramped and overcrowded prefabs they will be restricted and will lose out in their education.  In the long term we will all lose out as a result because one inculcates a love of learning in children at the earliest age.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The Minister of State, Deputy Máire Hoctor, was in an Oireachtas committee meeting with me some years ago where we spoke of the issue of science at primary level and secondary level.  This matter must be pushed to the fore because I know of second level students who have never seen a science experiment.  If our economy is dependent on technology and science I cannot understand why we do not support our teachers more in the classroom by providing laboratory technicians.  This would mean the technician could set up experiments in the classroom and the teacher could arrive from another class to teach the lesson; the students would then experience hands-on education.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">It is crucially important that students experience the magic and thrill of science but in many of our schools that does not happen.  I know students who will not take a science subject for the leaving certificate and one of the main reasons for this is they have never experienced hands-on science.  This is not the fault of teachers, students or parents but it is the fault of the Minister for Education and Science, who refuses to make resources available to employ laboratory technicians.  I am told the cost of such an initiative would be €8 million per year and this would be a fantastic investment.  Schools and science teachers are crying out for this and I am sure the Minister will address the issue.  Can she explain how young people are supposed to love science without seeing, experiencing and partaking in science experiments?  This is what is required from the earliest age and throughout the education process.  If anyone other than the Minister is listening to this I hope they take note.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I welcome this Bill as it is crucially important that we support students and I congratulate the body that created the website <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i>, which is also most welcome.  It is important that information be freely available.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">I only recently found out that an appeals system existed for those refused grants.  I did not know they could appeal further to the Department of Education and Science.  As far as I know they are not told that when they get a refusal letter.  I ask the Minister to ensure in the interim that is done.  It should be clear there are two steps of appeal already in place.  The Minister talked about an appeals system, but nobody was told it is in place.  It appears to be some State secret.  When the legislation is enacted, students should be clearly told if they get a letter of refusal that they have a right to appeal, where to go and how to go about it.  That should also be made clear if there is a second right of appeal.  That is crucially important.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Much has been said about the 33 awarding bodies and some Members have questioned it.  I understand one of the VECs will be asked to take responsibility for the overall IT set-up.  That is crucially important for paying out the money.  There are great strengths in having local bodies.  I am aware a Green Paper on local authorities will be published soon and that VECs are linked to local authorities and mirror that structure.  If there are changes in local authorities how will that impact on VECs?  It is important to keep an eye on this because if there are fewer local authorities or if there are amalgamations there will be fewer VECs.  At this stage, none of us knows whether that will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">The VECs have a great deal of strength.  In 1997, Fine Gael proposed local education boards, but the Government that took office afterwards ridiculed that proposal and said it would not work.  Now it is beginning to see that the VECs are almost becoming local education boards.  They have been given more responsibility and are expanding their role, and rightly so.  They have the expertise, personnel, knowledge and tradition.  VECs should be further supported in their role.  I understand they are being given responsibility for youth services.  The Youth Work Act 2001 is still in the doldrums and I am not sure if anybody is responsible for keeping an eye on it at this stage.  Again, the VECs were going to be asked to implement that Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">It is important that VECs are properly resourced to carry out all the functions they have been asked to do and that the staff are not under pressure because the Bill provides for time limits, which is only right.  I note that the Minister said the student grant application form for 2008-09 is available online.  I downloaded a copy earlier.  The closing date is 29 August 2008.  In Scotland, for example, there is an online application facility and I do not see why we cannot have such a facility.  I do not think we can download these forms at present.  The copy I have here is for information purposes only and one has to get the hard copy.  I do not know why we cannot download these forms but I hope it will be possible.  If the motor taxation office can do it, we should be able to do so.  The Minister can get her car taxed through the motor taxation office.  Why is it not possible to apply online?  I hope we are aiming towards that.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">I note that in Scotland, application for other allowances can be made online and that students can apply as early as April, before the end of the academic year preceding third level.  This means that students will have a decision on their grant application before they enter college.  This is real progress.  It would be of huge benefit to many students if they could apply for and get a decision on grant applications before they begin college.  I have said for a number of years that should be possible.  The tax year ends in December and the P60s are available in early February.  There is no reason students should not have that information as early as possible.  I call on the Minister to ensure this is brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">I also note that Scotland has an online tracking facility and an online calculator.  This means a student can go online, insert all his or her details and see whether he or she is eligible for the grant. I tried this the other night and it works.  One can track one's grant application through the system.  We cannot even download the forms here, as far as I know.  Where are we going?  I appreciate this Bill was promised in 2002, almost six years ago, but we have a long way to go to catch up with our colleagues in other jurisdictions.  Many students and their families in Scotland would know almost immediately if they were eligible for a grant and, if so, what level they would receive.  That is what we should aim for.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The Bill refers to full-time courses and so on but we need to look at part-time students.  There are people who are working hard on low incomes and who want to go back to college to better themselves and improve their status.  Once somebody does that we all benefit.  Will the Minister clarify how part-time students are provided for?  He or she may be working part time in a low paid job and may want to attend college at night.  Can such a person apply through this new super duper Bill the Minister has introduced or will the Minister consider making that possible?  Those people with initiative — some may have children — should be supported.  We must help such people if at all possible.  If they prove they need it we should help them.  My motto is that we should help people to help themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">There is a provision in the Bill for the inclusion of private colleges at some stage.  I am informed there are courses available in private college that are not available in other colleges.  For that reason we need to look at the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">There is an issue with the whole area of dependency.  I have come across cases where students have become estranged from parents at 19 years of age and yet the parents' income is taken into account.  The student is living on his or her own and wants to go to college but is often asked for the father's P60, the mother's income or the family income.  I know the Minister said in her speech we cannot have a situation where people will leave home to get the grant, but where there is a genuine case we should support them if possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">I wish to raise an issue that may have been resolved.  Bodies such as Science Foundation Ireland award scholarships.  It appears that if somebody gets such a scholarship they are not eligible for the maintenance grant, even though their income is very low.  That problem needs to be addressed.  I know of one case, in particular, where that happened.  The person was awarded the scholarship and was told he or she was not eligible for the maintenance grant because one cannot get two payments.  That the person should be worse off by being awarded a scholarship is wrong.  The Department is working hard to resolve the issue but I do not have the up-to-date information.  Perhaps it has been resolved but, if not, I ask the Minister to look into it.  If Science Foundation Ireland awards scholarships we should not penalise a person for reaching that level of attainment.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">It is important we have appeals procedures.  The time allowed for appeals is very long but consideration should be given to reducing it.  A student could have to wait four and a half months if he or she goes through all the appeals before getting a decision.  It should not take that long.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">There are appeals officers who are appointed from VECs and some VECs are very small.  If appeals officers are appointed from within the VEC that may cause a problem for the VEC.  Perhaps the appeals officers should be appointed from outside the VEC, from another awarding body.  That would help, particularly with a very small VEC, and would be important even on a rotational basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">I welcome the establishment of the appeals board.  It is important that students are represented on this board because it is they who are at the coalface.  I ask the Minister to take this into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">Despite checking the Bill, I did not find a reference to whether the adjacent rate and non-adjacent rate will still apply.  These rates were introduced long ago and I am not sure they are still relevant in this day and age.  What difference would it make if everyone received the non-adjacent rate?  There are all kinds of anomalies in this regard.  While it may be anecdotal, I have heard of a case of a man who moved the gate of his house so his car clocked up a little more distance.  That is daft.  Either the rate should be graduated or everyone should get the one rate.  This scheme was introduced at a time when people were walking and travelling by bicycle or horse and trap.  We should not be sending staff out to measure distances and clock cars and work out that if one travels a different route, the distance will be different.  This should be scrapped, if it has not already been scrapped.  Everyone should get the non-adjacent rate, unless there is another rationale for this measure which I cannot understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">I referred earlier to the number of hours a student is required to spend attending a course, which is part of the conditions of an approved course.  The position of part-time students needs to be addressed as a major issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">As I noted earlier, there is a crisis with regard to school places.  In my town of Midleton, both of the second level schools are full.  The two principals tell me that next September they will be turning students away.  One of the issues with the Department is that the information Deputies receive by way of response to parliamentary questions is very poor.  The Minister should examine this issue to ascertain whether she could improve this in any way.  We do not do this for political reasons.  Deputies are simply representing the people but they get the barest amount of information.  If a parent comes to us to find out whether a school will get an extension, and a Deputy is told the school is listed on band X, that means nothing to the parent.  Will the Department give us the full information and tell us, for example, it has received and is considering the information and will probably be able to make a decision on a certain date?  This would be helpful for parents.  However, the information we get from the Department is dire.  Perhaps the Department's staff are overworked and underpaid.  The Minister should examine this issue and make a decision on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">I welcome this important Bill.  I want it implemented as quickly as possible and look forward to its progress through the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_679">I welcome the introduction of the Bill, which is timely, if not long overdue considering it was a commitment in the previous programme for Government.  It is important to note the positive contribution made by Deputy Stanton, who indicates a strong measure of support for and agreement with the principles of the Bill.  In the light of statements by his party spokesperson on other issues in education, perhaps when the Bill comes for eventual decision he might consider supporting it in the House.  The reality is that he probably will not do so because he is operating under the system we on this side also operate under.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Behan</from>
          <p eId="para_681">We will see what happens when the time comes.  Nonetheless, I agree wholeheartedly with many of Deputy Stanton's points on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">As was said, this is a long overdue proposal to modernise and rationalise the student support schemes.  It must be remembered that fees for those attending third level are a thing of the past.  This, more than anything else, has ensured greater access generally for people within the education system.  However, we still need the student support schemes to ensure that those who are in the most disadvantaged circumstances get all the help they require to ensure they also have access to third level.  I welcome that the Minister in these proposals and in her statements on the Bill has emphasised that much thought and effort will go towards ensuring that the supports available are targeted particularly at those who are most marginalised and disadvantaged in our communities.  A number of welcome initiatives in this regard have been enacted by the Minister in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">I am indebted to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for a very informative debate pack, which I understand is a new service to Members of the Houses, that provides background information on the Bills coming through the House and enables new Deputies such as myself to undertake focused research with regard to a Bill, how it came about and the work that has been done to support it.  Among the items in the pack for this Bill is a statement of the objectives of the scheme, which, while they have already been stated by Members, are worth reiterating.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">The objective is to modernise and rationalise the existing scheme.  The proposed single unified scheme will provide a more coherent administration system which will facilitate consistency of application and improve client accessibility.  It will provide a system for the making of grants to enable young people to attend higher and further education in certain institutions.  There is also a welcome change with regard to the residency requirement, so that three years residence in the previous five years will be required.  This will allow young people, who these days often like to take a year out before they attend third level, to access the grants scheme if they have been resident for three of the previous five years.  This is a wise and welcome development.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">Like Deputy Stanton, I am not clear whether there was an independent appeals board in the past but this Bill allows for one.  I have sympathy for the Deputy's view that if an independent person is adjudicating on appeals, it would be wise if that person was part of the existing decision-making body.  This would make sense and I am sure is an issue the Minister will consider when the time comes.  The clarity provided is also welcome with regard to eligibility criteria.  The launch of the <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i> website also aids the issue of clarifying the information available.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">As one who has served on both a town and a county VEC in Bray and County Wicklow, I welcome the wise decision to nominate VECs throughout the country as the bodies which will administer this scheme.  As noted by other Members, some of whom may have served on VECs, the VECs have local democratic accountability, local knowledge and are rooted in the community, and they will ensure people have someone to whom they can address their concerns and difficulties with regard to filling out an application.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">I agree with Deputy Stanton's point on the expected future possibility of downloading the application and applying on-line.  This is becoming the most predominant way to apply in the CAO system and the grant scheme should also incorporate this facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Stakeholders' comments on the Bill have to date been universally welcoming.  Statements have been issued by several stakeholders, including the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, the National Adult Learning Organisation, Aontas, and not surprisingly, by Michael Moriarty, general secretary of the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA.  It is clear that all of these stakeholders agree with the provisions of the Bill and support it.  As we heard from at least one Opposition speaker today, there is support on the Opposition side of the House for the Bill also.  We look forward to seeing that support translated into real action when the time comes to make the decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">I compliment the Minister and her officials on the introduction of the Bill.  I preface my remarks by paying a warm tribute to county council officials throughout the country who operated the education grants for many years.  The area of student grants was badly in need of reform.  Education is for life.  It is a lifelong experience, from the cradle to the grave.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">I am pleased the Department of Education and Science consulted widely with all stakeholders.  I welcome the Bill in the context of those consultations.  Most of the parties involved warmly and eagerly support the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for student grants and to enable students to attend higher and further education courses.  Such education is vital as young people are our finest asset.  I welcome the many students who are present in the Gallery and I wish them well in the future in their education and careers.  The principal objective of the Bill is to create a more coherent system for the administration of these grants, which will facilitate consistency of application and improved client accessibility.  In brief, it will enable the development of an awards system that can deliver grants on time to those who need them most.  This is paramount.  In the past it has been traumatic for students and their families who had to wait unduly for grants to be paid.  A fair appeal system was not in place and much stress and trauma was involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The Bill provides for the structures around which an efficient and customer-friendly student grant process can be built, as well as providing the general basis on which students will, in future, be eligible for a grant to attend a course of higher or further education.  I thank the VEC, Department officials and council staff.  I am delighted that it has been decided to put the scheme under the remit of the VEC.  Having served on a VEC for almost 20 years and on its adult education board I am conscious that it is well placed to deal with all matters of education, especially further and continuing education.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I welcome the new appeals system.  It is important to have an independent appeals system.  Fairness and transparency are vital to this process.  Reference has been made by other speakers to the importance of these grants to the underprivileged and low income families.  However, self-employed people who have a reasonable standard of living can experience difficulties in business or health.  I almost dare not refer to the dreaded tax clearance certificate but problems can occur when accounts are not prepared in time.  It is important to have a fair appeals system and proper recognition of the difficulties that can be experienced by small family businesses.  I propose that assessment of income should be based on net income rather than gross income as capital allowances for small businesses are not taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">I compliment the Minister on the introduction of the Bill.  I welcome the residence changes.  It is important to streamline this area as it has been a cause of concern in the past.  In some cases young people of 19 or 20 years no longer live at home and they have a right to be assessed independently of their parents.  I welcome the fact that this will be the case.  I accept that transparency is necessary in this regard.  The appeals process will ensure this is the case.  Fairness to all sides is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Like previous speakers, I hope the final version of the Bill will be warmly supported.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BobbyAylward" eId="spk_382">
          <from>Deputy Bobby Aylward</from>
          <p eId="para_697">I thank my two colleagues for sharing time and giving me an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am very pleased that the Student Support Bill 2008 is being moved through this House and I am delighted to endorse the provisions of the Bill as being largely supportive of students applying for higher education grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The Bill generally provides for making grants available to all those who wish to pursue further and higher education courses and who, owing to their financial circumstances, might not otherwise be in a position to afford these courses of study.  The principle of promoting further educational opportunities has long been cherished in this country and providing broad and easy access to those opportunities is critical to ensure equity of access for all who want to advance their knowledge, skills and employability in the future.  Good education is one of our proudest resources and we have a bounden obligation to facilitate access to further education.  This is a sound philosophy which we all endorse and I am delighted to be associated with the Bill and its very practical measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">This legislation is constructive and progressive.  It represents a timely response to criticisms which have been levied over the years about the seemingly fragmented, often unco-ordinated and frequently frustrating manner in which the various grants schemes have operated.  There appeared to be various flaws inherent in that system and, from my experience of the schemes, they certainly did not appear to be user friendly.  Currently, four schemes are available in this country.  They are the higher education grants scheme, the VECs' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.  I understand there are 57,000 students availing of these schemes at present.  It is pragmatic and reasonable to integrate our system of grants and it is entirely appropriate that applicants be facilitated in their applications in terms of access to information and ease of process.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">The primary purpose of this Bill is to streamline the existing process.  This will give us a single statutory basis for processing applications and disbursing all student grants.  It will replace the four different schemes currently operated by the VECs and the local authorities, which is a very positive measure.  It is envisaged the VECs will be given sole responsibility for the administration of the student maintenance grants and this will halve the current number of awarding authorities to 33.  This is eminently sensible.  It finally introduces a note of wisdom into the current arrangements by seeking to rationalise and streamline the whole procedure for student applicants.  This unified approach will undoubtedly bring greater cohesion and greater clarity to the procedures.  Anything which lends increased efficiency and timeliness of response is to be welcomed wholeheartedly.  A streamlined system will improve the overall service to students in terms of accessibility, facilitate a greater consistency in the method of application for these grants and ensure the timely delivery of grant payments to students who are usually strapped for cash.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">I am also very pleased to note the Bill sets out explicit timeframes for payment of the grants and it enables far better efficiency in terms of the internal arrangements for processing the numerous applications.  The proposal to simplify the range of different grants available and the awarding authorities to which one must apply will certainly lend itself to greater clarity, less confusion, increased efficiencies and improved accessibility for intending applicants.  The overhaul of the current complicated system has been welcomed with enthusiasm by all interested parties, including the Union of Students in Ireland and Aontas.  I am glad to welcome the new procedures as sensitive, positive and hugely helpful to all those students who avail of the grant award schemes every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The intention contained in the Bill to establish an independent appeals board is a noteworthy and very constructive measure.  The existence of an independent statutory body will certainly promote far greater transparency and public confidence in the entire grants awarding process.  The Bill is also powerful in that it contains teeth.  It gives greater strength and vigour to enable the issue of fraud to be pursued successfully by the awarding authority.  It sets out significant offences and penalties which definitely provide a solid basis to actively pursue those applicants who may have provided false, misleading or incomplete information for the purpose of securing a grant.  The awarding authority will have the necessary force of law to ensure no irregularities occur in the system as a result of fraud.  This provision is essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">The Bill is enlightened and progressive as it promotes improved equity of access to further and higher education for groups which are under-represented in society.  It requires the institutions which are involved to formulate and to actively implement clear access plans and policies on equality.  Equality and access are extremely important in the overall context of education and I am delighted the Student Support Bill underpins those core objectives and values within the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">It is anticipated this legislation will be ready to come into effect for new applicants for the academic year 2009-10 and I am pleased the necessary transitional arrangements are in place to effect the change.  It is vital to minimise disruption to students and it is critical the VECs be allocated sufficient time to develop their infrastructure and resources so this fully-integrated scheme can be applied effectively.  I look forward to the Bill being implemented.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_705">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  One wonders how the current structures existed for so long.  We have four schemes, the higher education grants, third level maintenance grants, VEC scholarship scheme and PLC maintenance grant scheme.  There are 66 awarding authorities.  If one set out to create a more complex and bureaucratic scheme, one could not do much worse.  This chaotic, complex scheme is a maze for any student and parent to get through.  The delays and disparities between the various awarding authorities and the complexity of the various schemes arise year after year.  Every autumn there is a chaotic situation whereby students await their grants which the various authorities provide at different times.  Students have no money when their courses begin and may wait for months before they receive their money.  That is no way to conduct business.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">I commend the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, for introducing this Bill to improve the chaotic situation to some degree.  The Minister was right to provide a single, unified grant scheme to replace the four existing grant schemes.  Putting one, simplified scheme in place is the way to go.  I cannot say the same about the other side of the coin.  The Minister had reduced the 66 awarding authorities to 33.  A 50% reduction is to be welcomed, but 33 awarding authorities is still mind-boggling.  I say that as somebody who has served on a VEC.  I was chairman of the City of Dublin VEC for seven years and served on the local authority and I know the system that operates in all cases and the fantastic work done by the VECs.  They constitute the most progressive section of the education system in this country.  They do fantastic work and have responded brilliantly to the changing needs of society.  They have been the finest in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">Nevertheless, many VEC committees are very small.  There are town and county committees.  Some run only one or two schools.  It is a top-heavy approach to have them provide a separate secretarial, operational and administrative service for the awarding of tuition and maintenance grants.  I do not see why it is necessary.  I do not understand the purpose.  It remains a decentralisation of the process, but the ideal would be to have a single, unified awarding system in line with the single, unified grant system.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Could the Minister examine putting it on a regional basis?  For example Sligo could award grants in the north west, Galway in the south west, Limerick in half of Munster, Cork in the other half and the City of Dublin VEC in Dublin.  The Minister could reduce it to six without too much trouble.  We know there will be in-fighting and it is impossible to keep everybody happy all the time.  If one was starting from scratch, one would never have 33 awarding bodies, never mind 66.  Could the Minister address that in her response?  Could the system be reviewed after a couple of years to see how the legislation works and whether it would be appropriate to restrict the number of awarding authorities?  When the IVA comes together and discusses this legislation it might examine this aspect.  The VECs can still carry out all their good educational work including teaching and services to the community, but this is an administrative, bureaucratic type of work they need not necessarily do because it is not directly teaching, tuition or education.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">My second point is on something I welcome, but which the Minister has hidden away under the heading "Miscellaneous" at the very end of the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_711">For all that I am sure it does not mean the Minister does not consider it should be up front because the Bill is about student support and not about other issues.  However, the Minister has hidden an extremely important issue in section 25.  I will read the explanatory memorandum:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_712">Section 25 requires specified institutions to prepare draft access plans in respect of access to the institution by economically or socially disadvantaged people, by people who have a disability and by people from sections of society that are significantly under-represented in the student body and in respect of equality, including gender equality, in all activities of the institution.  Once the access plan is approved by the governing authority, the institution in question is bound to implement the policies set out therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">That is a fantastic statement for any educational institution and I compliment the Minister 100% on putting it on the Bill, although I would like to see it moved up higher.  When that is put on a statutory basis it will provide the means for giving greater access to sectors of our community that have traditionally lacked that access.  In my constituency, Dublin Central, the third level access rate is lower than in other parts of the city and country.  That is because it has traditionally been a very disadvantaged area.  There is great difficulty in getting adequate services at primary and secondary level, making it a difficult transition into third level, and this is often due to parental background, financial resources and basic education and tuition.  Much work has been done by the VECs in trying to bridge that gap.  They have provided a wide range of courses and the primary and secondary schools are providing a more holistic approach to the education of young people than they did in the past.  Larkin community college on Sean McDermott Street provides a wide range of incentives to young people to allow them stay on in school.  That is happening for the first time ever in the history of the State.  The NCI is also providing a wide range of courses that give a whole new group an opportunity to access third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">All third level institutions should have mission statements of this nature.  They should look at their catchment area.  There are national catchment areas, but there are regional and local catchment areas as well.  The institutions should specify the mechanisms used to maximise access by a particular community, be it a disability community, a gender community, a disadvantaged community, or whatever.  I do not think such a mechanism has ever been specified in legislation.  I hope the mission statement requirement in section 25 will be part of an annual approach drawn up by each institution, and that the Department of Education and Science will carefully monitor the quality of the statement regarding access.  If all this can be put in place, the Student Support Bill 2008 will go beyond the narrow remit of providing a more streamlined support mechanism for operating student grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The appeals mechanism is very welcome, but it will be diluted considerably unless it is a speedy mechanism.  The purpose of the single agency and the reduction in the number of awarding authorities is to ensure that every student receives his or her grant within a month of making an application.  If an appeals mechanism doubles, trebles or even quadruples that time, then the purpose of the Bill will be defeated.  Those students initially refused will find themselves in limbo for a long time.  They could start their course in September but may not have the appeal mechanism exhausted until well after Christmas.  That could deter somebody from going to college.  No appeals mechanism should be longer than the initial period of time for the grant delivery.  I suggest that no appeal should take longer than 21 days, as three weeks should be sufficient.  We are talking about a relatively small number of appeals, so why should we not curtail the period of time for them?</p>
          <p eId="para_716">The grants do not cover part-time students, but these students must also pay fees and maintenance.  This is an element of access to education.  The theory both here and in the EU is that education should be more flexible.  It should be continuing and should be delivered in a manner that suits students.  Many students find that part-time or night-time education is more appropriate.  There are many courses that take that into consideration.  It is also an essential part of further education, because many people will be employed at that time.  It would be more desirable to extend education to more vulnerable categories in society, on the basis of disadvantage, disability and gender.  This could happen if there was greater flexibility for part-time students.  We should look at it to a greater extent than provided for in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I welcome the fact the bar has been lowered from 23 years of age.  Students under 23 could hitherto only be assessed on their parents' income, which was an unnecessarily rigid bar.  Students living away from home should be assessed independently in their own right, but the assessment at 23 years for students living at home is still very rigid.  I accept the proposal is a significant move from the current situation, but it could be examined again.  In recent years, property prices have gone through the roof and there are very few people who can buy their own home or rent their own accommodation to any great degree.  More people are remaining at home with their parents.  Nobody should be pressurised into the property market to access a grant.  Until that settles down, it will be a bar to the involvement of many in third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">For some reason, the Department does not see itself as having any major role to play in student accommodation.  A great part of student grants go on accommodation.  While the bottom has slipped out of the construction industry, the rental industry is going through the roof and the cost of rented accommodation has never been higher.  It is ironic that while the property market has collapsed, rents have increased.  This is proving increasingly tough for students.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Although certain incentives were made available to provide student accommodation, the Department should consider assuming a role in this area.  With Grangegorman about to become the headquarters for the Dublin Institute of Technology, the decision on whether to provide student accommodation on the campus has been left exclusively to the DIT.  The Government effectively handed over a new campus and left it up to the DIT to decide which educational facilities it wishes to provide.  As a result, the provision of on-campus student accommodation will depend on the contents of the master plan.  This is not the correct approach as it does not reflect integrated planning, a concept that should have formed an essential part of the legislation establishing the Grangegorman Development Agency.  The Minister's representatives on the board of DIT should insist that the institution provide a sizeable amount of student accommodation on the site.  This would help alleviate some of the problems likely to arise from establishing an institution for 20,000 to 25,000 students in the heart of Dublin.  For example, a large volume of traffic will enter Dublin to access the facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Despite having an enormous land bank, only a limited number of students live on the campus of University College Dublin.  More students live on the tiny land bank in Trinity College Dublin than on the UCD site.  If student accommodation is available cheek by jowl with educational facilities, access to classes improves considerably and the stability of the campus is improved by the creation of a living culture and environment, without which campuses die at night time, apart from its pubs or the odd society meeting.  Many steps could be taken to make improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">One frequently hears that application forms for grants are complex and difficult.  An earlier speaker stated that much greater use should be made of the Internet.  It should be possible to download all relevant documents, including explanatory memorandums indicating how and when application forms should be filled out, explaining how the appeal mechanism works and providing information on other issues.  This will be even more important when 33 awarding bodies are in place.  If the information I describe is available on a single, good website at the click of a mouse, it will have significantly simplified the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">In reducing by half the number of awarding authorities, the legislation substantially increases the workload of the awarding authorities.  It will not be acceptable, at the stroke of a pen, to streamline the process and make a commitment that every student will receive his or her grant within a specified period if the Department does not provide sufficient resources to enable the VECs to perform this additional work.  We would be back to square one.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">I welcome this worthwhile legislation and hope it will improve the operation of the grant system.  I ask the Minister to consider reviewing the legislation after three to five years, with a view to further streamlining it.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_386">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_724">Tá áthas orm labhairt ar an mBille um Thacaíocht do Mhic Léinn 2008.  Is fíor a rá go bhfuil a lán dul chun cinn déanta ag an Rialtas i rith na mblianta chun cabhair agus deontais a thabhairt do mic léinn triú leibhéal.  Chuir an Rialtas €243 milliúin ar fáil tríd na ceithre scéim éagsúla i 2007.  Bhain 56,000 mic léinn triú leibhéal — agus ceathrú leibhéal ó am go ham — sochar as na deontais sin.  Tá na teorainneacha cáilithe ardaithe faoi 3.5% sa bhliain acadúil 2007-08 agus tá an deontas imithe in airde freisin.  Is méadú suntasach é sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">I welcome the Bill.  As a Deputy and in my previous role, I have received many queries on student support issues.  Based on my experience, it is clear the process of applying for grants and appealing decisions made by county councils and VECs is characterised by considerable confusion.  A dearth of information is available to students, particularly mature students and those returning from abroad.  The problem is primarily one of a lack of information rather than a shortage of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Deputy Costello raised a number of the points I intended to make.  The vocational educational committees are eminently capable of performing the function of providing student support.  My local VEC in County Meath will prove itself a model in delivering the services required of it under the Bill and I am sure its members look forward to performing this function.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">I ask the Minister to explain the purpose of having a separate appeals officer in the VECs.  While there may be good reason for establishing this statutory post, it appears slightly odd that decisions by the awarding bodies should be appealed to a member of their staff, particularly as the chief executive may make the decision in the first instance.  This provision appears to create duplication of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">Deputy Costello referred to the role of students in the appeals mechanism.  Perhaps it is not necessary to have such an intermediate appeals process.  Having appealed a number of decisions on student grant awards on behalf of constituents, the problem I encountered was finding information on how to pursue an appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">On the option to extend the 30-day period for appeals, perhaps the Minister is aware of cases where such an extension was justified.  Deputy Costello made a fair point regarding the difficulty it creates for students.  However, it also creates difficulties for the VECs, which may come under intense pressure, including from elected representatives, to extend deadlines when it may not be necessary to do so.  The old adage of "give an inch, take a mile" may be relevant in such cases.  I am not criticising the Bill but making some observations on it.  It is good legislation that finally places the student support process on a statutory footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">It is important to establish an independent appeals body.  In the cases I have dealt with, the decision of the VEC would be notified to the applicant by the chief executive.  If the decision was appealed, the appellant would invariably receive a further letter from the chief executive notifying him or her that the original decision stood.  The current procedure is not fair if the same person effectively decides on the application and any appeals arising therefrom.  The Bill changes this but is the intermediate appeal necessary?  The appeals process should be streamlined more and I question its necessity.  How likely is it that a staff member of a VEC such as County Meath VEC, which is a small but effective institution, will make changes or perform a worthwhile function?</p>
          <p eId="para_731">As I mention County Meath VEC, the Minister is aware of a number of significant projects in which it is engaged at present, particularly with regard to Coláiste na hInse in my area, which is going through the planning process and which will open in September.  It has almost 100 pupils for first year and a professional job is being done of opening the school.  This is evident in the community and it gives me great confidence that County Meath VEC will be willing to take on these extra responsibilities which will be bestowed by the Oireachtas.  I know the Minister does not intend to launch a pilot programme to implement the changes included in this Bill but if she did I would recommend County Meath VEC.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">With regard to previous difficulties, in Trinity College a notice board showed the local authorities and VECs, such as Drogheda VEC, County Louth VEC, County Meath VEC, City of Dublin VEC and County Dublin VEC, from which grants had arrived.  It was alleged the grants became available when the Government supplied the money and perhaps this was the case.  It proved difficult for many people who depended on the money to pay deposits for rental accommodation and to get started in college.  Students should be encouraged to work as much as they can during the summer holidays and contribute to their education.  They should not be entirely dependent on the State.  The State has only a certain role to play.  As a student, I worked during college and this is no harm so long as it does not interfere with studies.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">From reading the Bill, I understand the awarding authorities, namely the VECs, will have the power to create application forms.  Should the Minister do this through regulation or append it to the legislation?  Will it lead to a divergence of practice?  Should the design of the form and deciding the information requested be a central function?  I am not sure what discretion is required and it seems discretion is being offered.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">When we think about third level grants we think of the main universities and institutes of technology with which we deal all the time.  A wide range of third level education is available in the State.  Under section 8, the Minister is allowed define approved institutions whose students can benefit from grant assistance.  A number of them are automatically deemed to be approved institutions, such as publicly funded institutions.  Private institutions also exist and section 8 also sets out the criteria to which the Minister must have regard when deciding what is an approved institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">Is the Minister minded to add in a section as to the institutions' commitment to the Irish language?  I know not all institutions teach Irish but perhaps the Minister could take it into account.  It might encourage newer institutions to take a more active role in promoting the Irish language, particularly in business courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The Bill includes the definition of an approved course.  The Minister can approve a course under the Bill, which contains a long list of criteria to which the Minister must have regard.  Some might argue the Oireachtas should decide on what is an approved course and not give the discretion to the Government.  In this case it is necessary because courses change and new courses are brought into being.  The Minister knows what to do and the Oireachtas has given her guidance on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">Under section 10, the awarding authorities are obliged to assess and review the resources required by them for the purpose of performing their functions.  An increase of resources will be required.  The Minister should select a couple of extremely good VECs and ask them to come up with systems that would work.  Very good people work in the VEC sector throughout the country.  I will not name names but the Minister knows who they are.  I would love if they were heavily involved in this because they would take it on with gusto.  What do they need to run this system?  They are already doing it to an extent and will be only too delighted to expand their role.  The county councils will be fairly happy not to be involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Should we publish the list of recipients of grants?  I do not see it provided for in the Bill.  It would certainly discourage fraud and those who on paper are entitled to grants but in reality may not be.  Examples of this exist throughout society.  The focus today is on pharmacists.  The money doctors get under the GMS scheme, the money solicitors and barristers get under the legal aid scheme and TDs' salaries are published.  It does not tell the full story but it is published.  It is public money and the public is entitled to know.  Perhaps publishing the information on grants is a good idea but requires further thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">Under section 11, the Minister can transfer the functions of an awarding authority to another body when he or she thinks the body is not doing the job it is supposed to do.  Section 11(1)(<i>a</i>) is particularly relevant as it allows for the transfer from one VEC to another.  Perhaps a number of VECs will come together and ask the Minister to transfer functions from one or two to three or one to two.  It may not always be the case that the Minister is not happy.  Perhaps the VECs may feel they could do the work better jointly, particularly the smaller VECs.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Provision is made for nationality and residence requirements and I know this is major issue for the Department of Finance.  Is the habitual residence clause in social welfare law relevant?  Where an Irish child of parents who were required to work abroad wants to study in Ireland one might suggest he or she wants to avail of our low fees or free fees as compared to his or her home country.  However, perhaps they want to settle in Ireland which is where they really belong.  I have been in correspondence with the Minister on a number of cases of students living abroad who want to study in Ireland with regard to fees in particular but also to grants.  Rather than looking back with regard to residence can we look forward as we do in social welfare, although the residency requirement clause causes controversy.  Will the Minister examine this because people do lose out?</p>
          <p eId="para_741">Section 14 allows the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations for such matters of procedure and administration as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient in respect of applications by students for grants.  Will this allow the Minister to specify a form?  Section 15 states an applicant shall apply to an awarding authority for a grant.  An applicant cannot apply to receive more than one grant at one time.  Perhaps this is self-evident.  However, in other areas of society, particularly with regard to council housing, people are on lists with various local authorities.  Section 15(3) states "An applicant shall furnish to the awarding authority the information specified in subsection (4) and such other information as the authority may request".  While I accept an element of discretion is required for people to prove their income to qualify for a maintenance grant, this gives too much to the awarding authority.  It could be seeking documents that local authorities never sought.  Clear guidelines should be given as to what information should be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">Section 16 deals with change of circumstances and gives tremendous power to the awarding authority in the case where a student's circumstances change for the better and a grant may not be required.  What about when circumstances change for the worse?  There are many examples such as mature students or a student's parents no longer supporting them after a row.  I have encountered many such cases but there seems to be inflexibility in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">There should be a provision to allow a student apply for a grant during the academic year if his or her circumstances change.  Students attending advanced courses from the Law Society of Ireland in April this year will be assessed on income in 2006.  Fees for these courses are relatively high and many students attending them from the country must live in Dublin temporarily.  They will, however, be assessed for a period when they could have been working as apprentices and will not qualify for the grant.  My local authority treats a person starting a course in April as starting in September of the previous year and makes no allowance.  This inflexibility should be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I welcome the provision for a proper appeals system on a statutory basis.  It may be necessary to introduce time limits to give clarity to the process.  The appeal rules in the current system were often difficult to understand and deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Deputy Costello referred to section 25 which deals with access plans and equality programmes.  While it exempts established universities and institutes of technology to avoid replicating existing laws, it provides for access to private approved institutions by economically or socially disadvantaged people, by people who have a disability and by people from sections of society significantly underrepresented in the student body.  These institutions will have to report regularly on their access programmes and prove they are implementing the policies.  This is a welcome provision for the smaller and new colleges, highlighting they are not just businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">I thank the Minister for introducing this welcome legislation.  While students always give out — I did so myself when in college — it has been welcomed by the Union of Students in Ireland.  The sooner it is enacted the better.  If there is an opportunity to operate the Bill's provisions in pilot programmes this year, will the Minister consider County Meath VEC?</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_748">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  Student supports is an area with which all public representatives have first-hand knowledge and dealings.  I could spend the rest of the day outlining to the Minister genuine anomalies in the current supports system.  However, the most important aspect of the Bill is that the appeals process can advise the Minister of such anomalies and have them addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The rigid structure of the current system does not facilitate the easy processing of student maintenance grants.  Every speaker has stated the current system's structure with 66 different bodies is shambolic.  The fundamental problem with the system is the late payment of maintenance grants, leading to much hardship for students.  It is caused by the Minister of the day dragging his or her heels in announcing the income limit thresholds for third level grants.  In turn, applications for grants cannot be circulated until the Minister makes that decision.  This delays the whole process and leads to financial hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">Further delays in processing grants occur with the different local authorities.  It is not necessarily the local authorities with the largest workload that are the last to issue payment.  Students end up having to take out personal loans from banks until their third level grant comes through.  Such delays cause additional worry for leaving certificate students waiting for their results and subsequent CAO offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">The new website, referred to by Deputy Stanton, <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i>, will help allay some of those concerns.  The Minister, the Department and the Higher Education Authority are to be commended for this development.  Hopefully, we will see more utilisation of technology in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">Section 9 states an approved course must be a full-time course.  Over the years, all Members will have come across cases of part-time students and courses that are not covered by the higher education grant.  A constituent of mine is in receipt of the one-parent family payment and wants to participate in a distance-learning teacher training course run by Hibernia College, a course approved by HETAC and qualifying for the higher education grant.  While the Department of Social and Family Affairs would approve her back to education allowance if she were attending a full-time course in a recognised college, it will not approve a distance-learning course, even though it is Government policy to assist parents on the one-parent family payment.  The current policy needs to be reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">With four young children it is not possible for my constituent to move her family to Dublin to participate in the course.  Her difficulty is compounded by the fact she is ineligible for the higher education grant.  This leaves her with course fees of €8,000 per annum.  More co-ordination between the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Education and Science is needed.  If someone meets the requirements for the back to education allowance he or she should be deemed eligible for the higher education grant.  I know we cannot open it up to every single person in the country who is doing a part-time course and I fully accept that.  However, if people meet the criteria for the back to education allowance, surely we should try to facilitate them and encourage them to get out of the cycle of poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The Minister also said in her contribution that the Bill would provide for more demanding general residency requirements for maintenance grants.  How does that affect a cohort of people whose situation we have highlighted on numerous occasions, namely the illegal Irish in the USA who are now being forced to come home?  Some of these have no formal third-level education, while some left school with only their junior certificates or their group certificates before they went to the USA.  These people are denied access to social welfare or any other entitlements.  This condition will also now deny them access to education.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">The Bill also sets out nationality requirements for students from outside the European Union.  This is an extremely interesting area and one on which I want to focus.</p>

I submitted a question, which I thought was legitimate, regarding my concerns about the new arrangements with the US.  However, the question was disallowed and given to the Department of Finance.  I know it cannot be changed now and it probably got caught among the various offices, but in light of the news this week about the dollar and so on, which may eventually cause American companies to pull out of Ireland, I thought it was a legitimate question.  I am disappointed it was not allowed, but I understand it cannot be fixed now.  Many questions lately have not been getting through.  Maybe we are writing them wrongly but in this case a lot of thought went into writing it correctly.  I am surprised and disappointed it was not on the priority list.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_399">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_767">The EQUAL programme has provided co-funding to 43 projects over the programming period, one of which is the EMERGE project, which operates under the entrepreneurship pillar of the programme.  The aim of the EMERGE project was to develop methodologies for the development and expansion of ethnic minority enterprises, EMEs and to assist EMEs in overcoming business obstacles within the regulatory and cultural environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">The EQUAL programme is now coming to a close.  The experimental approach of EQUAL has provided the opportunity to test new ways of integrating marginalised groups into the workforce, preparing them for the world of work and increasing the skills of those already in employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">Innovation has been a key component and building block of the EQUAL programme and the EMERGE project has successfully developed innovative solutions to help respond to the specific needs of ethnic minority entrepreneurs.  In November 2007, the project launched the report Harnessing the Potential: Promoting Ethnic Minority Entrepreneurship in Ireland, which outlines the need to harness the potential of our ethnic entrepreneurs and to ensure that the required supports and training are in place.  My colleague Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, addressed the launch and welcomed the key findings and recommendations of the report.  Some responsibility for the subject matter and policy issues concerning participants in EMERGE lies within his remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">The success of the EMERGE project under the EQUAL programme has resulted in mainstreaming of the EMERGE approach by the Fingal County Enterprise Board with the support of local state agencies.  The Institute for Minority Entrepreneurship has taken on the EMERGE approach and Skillnets funding amounting to €350,000 has been secured for EMERGE skillnets.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">It is clear there is great potential for fostering entrepreneurship among the immigrant population in Ireland.  My Department welcomes the Harnessing the Potential report and will examine its findings and recommendations.  The successful mainstreaming of EMERGE shows that the lessons learned from this EQUAL project will continue to be applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">While there are certainly a number of issues which are specific to the immigrant population with regard to entrepreneurship, many of the findings and recommendations identified in Harnessing the Potential were addressed in both the Enterprise Strategy Group report of 2004 and the report of the Small Business Forum published in May 2006, both of which are in the process of being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">The Small Business Forum report placed particular importance on the development of the spirit and culture of entrepreneurship and recommended that the Government should adopt a national entrepreneurship policy focused on optimising the number of start-up businesses.  It also recommended that there should be a particular focus on the stimulation of latent entrepreneurial potential, particularly among women and the immigrant community.  My Department is committed to bringing forward a statement on national entrepreneurship policy in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">One way of embedding an entrepreneurship culture in Ireland and meeting the recommendations of the Small Business Forum is through the creation of a national entrepreneurship week to mobilise the key stakeholders in the area and to draw public attention to the topic.  My Department has secured funding to cover such a week as part of the 2008 Estimates process.  The Department would see a national entrepreneurship week as targeting all latent entrepreneurial potential within the population, including immigrants.  An additional separate national campaign for immigrants would needlessly duplicate such a process.  The recommendation of the Enterprise Strategy Group supported the One Step Up programme, which is now FÁS's key programme for improving the skills of those in employment.  This year the One Step Up programme has a budget of €46 million and is expected to deliver training to approximately 32,000 people.  The programme is open to people of all ethnic origins.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">It is clear that much has been happening to implement the recommendations identified in the EMERGE report and I anticipate that more will be done in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_777">I acknowledge the Minister's comment about innovation.  The report that has been published is interesting.  However, there is now a slowdown in the economy.  That is acknowledged on all sides of the House.  If we are to break out of that cycle it is important that we support small entrepreneurial businesses as much as possible.  One of the elements of this is the knowledge that is being brought into this country by our migrant community, who are bringing in new ideas and products.  However, there are two fundamental barriers to this.  The first is the issue of business permission.  What steps is the Minister taking, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to get rid of the excessively burdensome regulations that currently exist and ensure that decisions on business permission are based on the proposed business idea rather than a bureaucratic process, as is currently the case?</p>
            <p eId="para_778">What specific proposals is the Minister introducing to deal with the issue of access to finance?  For many migrant entrepreneurs, access to the traditional forms of finance, such as banking institutions, is not open to them.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_401" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_779">The economy is going through a transition phase and there has been significant correction, particularly in the construction sector.  In some ways this opens up opportunities for the entrepreneurial sector.  We are hoping that mobile capital and funding will be redirected towards start-up companies.  The good news is that the high-potential start-up companies supported by Enterprise Ireland — from last year, the previous year and this year, which we will launch next week — offer exciting evidence of the number of new companies emerging on the scene, particularly in value-added activities such as software, food products, life sciences and internationally traded services.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">The business permission scheme, which is operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is currently under review by the Department and by the Minister.  I would point out, however, that there are other ways in which people can get permission to start businesses.  Under the business permission scheme the migrant is required to satisfy certain criteria, including investment of up to €300,000, and the original rationale for this was to encourage employment creation.  However, this is not the only way in which a foreign national can operate a business in Ireland.  The right to operate a business depends on immigration status.  For example, EU nationals are automatically entitled to engage in business as one of their rights of free movement.  In addition, non-EEA nationals who have Stamp 4 permission also hold that right.  I will check this again, but my figures suggest that up to 60,000 people are in this category, which is a substantial number.  However, I will have this checked as it seems high to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">For the review of the business permission scheme we will certainly consider any ideas from the Deputy and we will work with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  However, the Deputy should bear in mind that we accept the point that there are significant entrepreneurial opportunities within the migrant population in Ireland.  Many of the schemes based on the report of the Small Business Forum, Skillnets and training issues are now being mainstreamed to provide supports.</p>

         the main provisions of the primary legislation aimed at enhanced compliance and enforcement of employment rights generally, including legislation to regulate the operation of employment agencies and a statutory code of practice for employment agencies, promised in the Government amendment to a motion passed on 20 February 2008; when it is expected that this legislation will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_409" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_790">The Employment Law Compliance Bill currently being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel is designed to secure better compliance with employment law in accordance with the provisions of part 2, sections 11 to 16 of Towards 2016, the ten-year framework social partnership agreement.  Drafting of the Bill is proceeding for Government consideration as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">The main provisions of the Bill include the establishment of a new statutory office of Director of the National Employment Rights Authority, dedicated to employment rights compliance, with a tripartite advisory board.  The Bill will also include provisions to secure better compliance with the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006 providing for the involvement, for the first time, in the enforcement of provisions of those Acts by the director of the National Employment Rights Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">The Bill will also strengthen inspection and enforcement powers of labour inspectors and make other necessary provisions to secure compliance with employment law as well as fostering increased co-operation at workplace level so as to safeguard employment rights generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">In addition, the Bill does the following: specifies the statutory employment records to be kept by employers for all employees and the high penalties for failure to do so or for other breaches of employment law, fosters increased co-operation at workplace level so as to safeguard employment rights, supports current monitoring and inspection activity for compliance with the registered employment agreement in the electrical contracting sector, provides for exchanges of information between statutory enforcement authorities so as to facilitate joint investigations of employment suspected of contravening the law and strengthens the powers of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to initiate investigations and publish the outcome in cases of public interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">In addition, proposals for an employment agency regulation Bill to update and strengthen the regulation of the employment agency sector have now been finalised.  I intend to submit a memorandum to the Government as soon as possible seeking approval for the drafting of the Bill by the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.  Publication of the proposed employment agency regulation Bill continues to be a priority for Government.  The Bill will provide for the licensing of employment agencies,  which will maximise the agreed objectives in Towards 2016 while at the same time remaining consistent with EC treaty provisions as interpreted by European Court of Justice rulings in the case of posted and agency workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">In addition, adherence to a statutory code of practice will be a condition for the granting of a licence in Ireland under the Bill.  As a statutory code, overseas employment agencies will also be subject to compliance with its terms.  The Bill will also provide for the setting up of a monitoring and advisory committee to advise me on the sector and assist me in the drawing up of the code of practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">Overall, the new Bill will repeal and replace the Employment Agency Act 1971 and regulations made under it which currently regulate the employment agency sector.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_410">
            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_797">The Minister is probably aware that the Labour Party published a protection of employees and agency workers Bill yesterday.  We are ready to debate it in the Dáil next week to help the Minister.  In this context, did the genie get out of the bottle recently when Davy published its report?  It lauded the findings of the OECD based on 2003 data that Ireland is one of the top ten least protected labour markets.  It trumpets our poor position in international league tables for worker protection.  It was particularly satisfied that, in 2003, we were joint best for allowing temporary worker agencies to operate.  All of this is viewed as important by Davy because labour market flexibility is an important factor in boosting productivity growth and increasing the incentive for companies to raise employment.  Labour market flexibility is important to maintain high employment, up to a point, but constantly undermining the terms and conditions of employees is not the route to productivity growth.  It encourages firms to use temporary agency workers and positively discourages the training set out in the Minister's skills programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">Tomorrow, under the Slovenian Presidency, the employment, social policy, health and consumer affairs meeting will take place.  Will Ireland lift its objection to the EU directive on temporary agency workers at that meeting?  If not, is it because of the underlying agenda, which permeated the report by Davy?  Why are we failing to ensure equality of treatment of workers that is applicable in every other country?  If the Slovenian Presidency pushes the agency directive to a vote, will the opposition of Ireland and Britain and any other government unwilling to accept a reasonable compromise be overcome by a qualified majority vote?  Does the Minister agree that this is essential if we are to stop the race to the bottom in pay and working conditions in Ireland and elsewhere and create a level playing field for workers and employers?</p>
            <p eId="para_799">There is no good reason the Government should hold back, adopting a veto position, by continuing opposition.  The Government is putting social partnership at risk and undermining worker support for the European project.  Would this measure not protect responsible employment agencies from unfair competition from operators who are not so responsible?  I appeal to the Minister to lift the veto and get the legislation in place.  If he does not, the Labour Party is prepared to help.  We have the Bill ready.  Let us protect people from exploitation.  We owe them that.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_411" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_800">There has been appalling spinning of this story from the beginning.  We agreed with the social partners to introduce legislation pertaining to agency workers.  As soon as the ink was dry on the agreement the trade union movement stated that it was not enough and sought more.  It is entitled to do so.  We had the legislative template ready to introduce an agency Bill after the last agreement.  However, the terms of the agreement were not sufficient for the trade union movement, which sought additional terms of pay parity.  Now, it has moved onto equality across all issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">Ireland has no veto powers in the European Council of Ministers because it is not strong enough.  However, Ireland is capable of contributing to a solution that does not put Ireland at a competitive disadvantage and that allows Ireland similar rights to other countries in terms of collective agreements, exemptions and opt-outs.  A memorandum will be sent to the Government and we are available to discuss with the trade unions and employers the basis of an agreed resolution.</p>
            <p eId="para_802">I welcome Deputy Penrose's belated acceptance of the importance of labour market flexibility, something that was absent from the debate two weeks ago during Private Members' business.  I hope Deputy Penrose cites the rest of the Davy report, which gives a positive picture of the future of the Irish economy and refers to the successful policies we have pursued in employment and education.  We are anxious for balance, allowing us to protect the rights of workers, which we are keen to do, while maintaining the impetus for job creation.  We will not tolerate exploitation.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_412" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_804">I assume the Deputy is referring to breaches of employment law or of employment-related legislation.   I reiterate, as indicated during the recent Private Members' motion of last week on agency workers, that this Government is deeply committed to decent standards of employment.  Significant and substantial measures to underpin our employment standards apply to all workers, including migrant workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">A large body of employment rights legislation, covering areas as diverse as the application of the national minimum wage, terms of employment, organisation of working time, payment of wages, protection of fixed-term and part-time workers, maternity leave, etc., is now in place.  The transposition into Irish law of the EU posting of workers directive, by virtue of enactment of section 20 of the Part-Time Work Act 2001, provides that employee protection applies to migrant workers in Ireland who have entered into a contract of employment that provides for those employed in the State or who work in the State under a contract of employment.  This means that irrespective of nationality or place of residence, migrant workers have the same rights under employment rights legislation as Irish employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">Our legislative framework is backed up with effective and strong new supports where all workers, including migrant workers, can vindicate their rights through the dispute resolution machinery of the State.  Under the Towards 2016 partnership agreement, the Government has committed to, and delivered on, key additions to enforcement capacity including a major upgrading of resources with the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, and substantial investment in additional resources in the labour inspectorate.  NERA is participating in an active information awareness campaign on employment rights and specifically in the case of migrant workers is publishing material to promote employment rights in up to 11 languages.  Additionally, ten of the 90 officers that form the labour inspectorate will have specialist foreign language skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">Combating exploitation or abuse of employment rights is not just a matter for Government and its agencies, it demands the engagement of wider civil society.  When setting up NERA the Government, through the Oireachtas, made a very significant additional investment in the areas of promoting compliance with employment law and in ensuring that, in the event of non-compliance, there are effective mechanisms for redress and, where appropriate, prosecution.  I would urge anyone who has specific complaints to contact NERA immediately to enable these to be investigated.  Alternatively, and where appropriate, employees should refer their complaints directly to the dispute resolution agencies for redress.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_413">
            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_808">I thank the Minister for listing the provisions in law.  I do not dispute the reply, except in respect of agency workers.  We have plenty of legislation in the country, the difficulty is the lack of enforcement of the law.  Has the Minister seen the NERA documentation in 11 languages?  It is not very detailed in respect of employment law.  It is fundamentally important that it is reviewed.  When will the foreign language inspectors be employed, deployed and carrying out inspections?  It was promised that 90 labour inspectors would be in place by 31 December 2007.  When will that number be employed and carrying out investigations?  Everybody wants to ensure this country does not have a migrant under class.  What discussions, if any, have taken place between the Minister and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with an ongoing anomaly in the system, where people who go to the Labour Court or other employment tribunals find that their work or residency permits expire during the delay in processing their applications?  They are then left illegally resident in the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_809">There has been much debate on this issue in recent times.  If people are aware of cases, I urge them to refer them to the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA.  That is the key advice I offer Deputies and the public.  We have significantly enhanced the number of labour inspectors in the past 12 months.  We have also regionalised the inspectorate significantly.  Approximately 76 inspectors are already working.</p>

            <p eId="para_811">Four or five have left.  There are some in training and the ten language inspectors are in place.  We are well advanced.  The only issue we had to resolve was through the industrial relations process and social partnership.  We worked with the unions in the public sector to devise methods of recruitment and so forth.  There has been a dramatic transformation not only in the number of labour inspectors but in the legal capacity the authority has and the financial advice available to it.  There is a strong management tier in the inspectorate.  We have merged several units from the old system into the new authority.  We are already beginning to see the impact of NERA, particularly in terms of its construction campaign, which is the subject of a later question, the number of site visits and the number of companies into which it inquired.  I am positive about the prospects for the impact it will have.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">We are working with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform towards a one-stop-shop or single office approach to synergise the visa and work permit issues.  We take a reasonable and flexible approach to people who fall between stools in such cases, particularly people who might have been subject to abuse by unscrupulous employers.  We try to regularise their employment status where it is clear that has occurred.</p>

            <p eId="para_823">The social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, provides for greater co-ordination between organisations concerned with employment rights compliance, with a view to realising the considerable potential for synergy that exists in this area.  In particular, the agreement provides that authorised officers of the new National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, will join officers of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in joint investigation units.  The role of these units is to address areas where evidence suggests that non-compliance with employment rights legislation exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007, which came into operation on 30 March 2007, provides for the disclosure of relevant employment data between the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and NERA.  This legislation effectively enables NERA to join the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to work together in joint investigation units.  Since the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007, exchange of information activity has already taken place between the bodies in several specific cases.  In addition, joint investigation unit activity, involving the three bodies, has also taken place, particularly in the context of the NERA construction industry campaign in May to July 2007.  A working group has been established comprising the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and NERA to further enhance procedures for improved cross-departmental co-operation, the sharing of information by the respective Departments and offices and to plan future joint investigation activities and strategies.</p>

            <p eId="para_825">Earlier this month the Minister's officials said the discussions were ongoing between the different Departments and agencies.

Why is there no provision for NERA imposing fines on rogue employers?</p>

            <p eId="para_826">The Deputy is wrong on that point.  I have seen the press release issued by the Deputy's colleague in that regard.  The press release referred to the national minimum wage legislation, in which there is no provision for fines.  The NERA legislation is not yet in place.  We are preparing legislation to bring to Government.  That legislation will provide, as has already been agreed in the context of Towards 2016 with the social partners, for significant additional fines for breaches of any aspect of employment legislation.  There will be significant increases as set down in the Towards 2016 document.  I can refer the Deputy to the relevant sections on social partnership which we will reflect fully in the legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_834">In any event, I assure the House that there will be significant penalties in the new national employment rights legislation.  There are now 76 inspectors employed in the National Employment Rights Authority.  A further five are due to commence on 3 March and the appointment of inspectors to fill the four remaining posts is progressing.  Five more vacancies arose with people retiring and so forth.  We had to go through certain processes with the trade union movement on these issues.  We did that faithfully and in the context of social partnership.  It represents substantial and significant progress in building a strong national body to enforce employment rights.  Over the past two years we have worked strongly on this issue and have delivered significantly with regard to social partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">With regard to the specific issue in the Deputy's question, significant progress has been made by the three Departments.  A campaign was conducted last year for the construction sector and a total of 173 employers were identified.  Contact by the joint investigation units was made with approximately 19 and there were eight joint site investigations.  The units are up and running.  Obviously, more work must be done on procedural issues and so forth between the three Departments.  However, the combination of the three Departments will act as a significant deterrent to people who endeavour to abuse employees.  The prospect of the Revenue Commissioners, labour inspectors and Department of Social and Family Affairs officials arriving at their door will be a spur to better behaviour by the more unscrupulous employers.</p>

            <p eId="para_836">The plan is to set up joint investigation units to engage in enforcement.  When will they be established?  Either the Minister is misleading me in the House or his official misled me a fortnight ago.  In his earlier reply the Minister said the legal capacity had been enhanced through the establishment of NERA.  The Minister is criticising me for not having done my research, yet he is contradicting himself from one question to the next.  What provision is available to NERA at the moment to impose fines on employers?  When will NERA have the power to impose fines, as we discussed earlier?</p>

            <p eId="para_837">One joint campaign has already been initiated by the three agencies, which I detailed earlier, concerning the construction sector.  In terms of NERA, it is a non-statutory body.  The legislation underpinning NERA is currently being drafted and a memorandum will go the Government shortly on it.  I have already outlined that to the Deputy.  Under the existing body of legislation to which I referred in an earlier answer, there are penalty provisions pertaining to any breaches of that legislation.  However, we will take the opportunity, in the context of the National Employment Rights Agency Bill, to increase fines and penalties.</p>

            <p eId="para_839">The key policy intervention concerning people on the live register at present is the national employment action plan preventive strategy which was first introduced in 1998 and rolled out nationwide in subsequent years.  This process involves a more systematic engagement with the unemployed.  On reaching a three month threshold on the live register, individuals aged between 18 and 64 years are referred by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to FÁS, where they are called in for interview and assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">Following the initial intervention clients would be expected to progress to training or employment.  If appropriate, FÁS employment services and the local employment services will support all unemployed people with such progression, including those over 55 years of age.  Clients may be placed on one of a range of employment and training programmes including, in particular, community employment, CE.  Community employment provides eligible unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">It also helps long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and offering the opportunity to enhance and develop their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">In addition my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy<b> </b>Éamon Ó Cuív, has responsibility for supporting the community and voluntary sector through the community services programme.  The objective of this programme is to support local community activity to address disadvantage, while also providing local employment opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">Unemployed persons in receipt of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit and other disadvantaged groups are eligible to participate in this programme once they meet the criteria which can be found on the website of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, <i> www.pobail.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">I assure the Deputy that I will continue to do everything to provide a range of proactive job-related services, supports and programmes to assist individuals to enter or re-enter the active labour market.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_440">
            <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
            <p eId="para_845">I thank the Minister for his reply.  I have a number of supplementary questions.  I accept we have made many improvements in this area.  There have been many changes and strategies in recent years but there are some areas where I would like to see further changes and where I encourage the Minister to work more with his colleagues in the Departments of Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, to improve matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">Let us face the fact that there are a number of people on the live register who could come off it and who could be engaged in training or work.  We must try to tackle and focus on them, one way or the other.  Community employment schemes are an excellent idea.  They benefit the community, the groups for which participants work, as well as the participants themselves, whose self-confidence and self-belief is improved immeasurably.  However, the three to six year cut-off point is ridiculous.  Initially people participate in the scheme for three years, but with some pushing and shoving, that can be increased to six years.  There is a certain category of people who, when they leave community employment schemes, have no real plans and no real hope of picking up another job.  They are falling between two stools.  There is a certain group of people who will not be lucky enough to get another job.  I ask the Minister to consider extensions to the schemes for age groups or categories of people.  That must be examined, even if it is not politically correct to mention it.  All Deputies have all met people of a certain category who get stuck when their community employment scheme ends.  They end up back on the live register or on a social welfare allowance for the rest of their days.  That must be tackled.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">We must also examine the issue of people turning down jobs because they are afraid they will lose their entitlements and be worse off.  Such people exist.  People of all abilities are turning down jobs because, although some social welfare payments are gradually reduced, that is not the case with medical cards, other health benefits and rent allowance.  In that context, it is very often not worth people's while to take up a job.  That must be changed.  We must do all we can to ensure that people can accept jobs.  This is not the sole responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  He must work with his colleagues on that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">There is a category of people who are receiving the job-seekers allowance who have no intention of ever working.  We all know such people exist.  It is not good enough and it is not fair that a certain percentage of people who are physically able to work do not want to work.  We must increase our efforts to get those people into training or work so they can give something back to their communities.  Their contribution would be gratefully received by many community groups and in many areas like estate or town maintenance.  It is wrong that people who are well able to work are getting through the system and spending most of their time at home, rather than working.  It is not good enough.  I am not referring to people who cannot work, but to people who will not work.  A percentage of people are well able to work and should be out there, contributing to society, which would benefit the taxpayer and the individuals concerned.  It is not right for people to spend too much time on their own, not contributing in any way to society.  These are the main areas in which I would like to see changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_849">That was a very lengthy question but I welcome some of the suggestions made by the Deputy.  I accept the broader point that we must do more in terms of labour activation measures.  I am not so sure there are huge numbers of people out there deciding not to work.</p>

            <p eId="para_851">I do not accept that totally.  We have reduced the threshold in the preventative plan from six months to three.  I met people in my clinic recently who had been working for 20 or 30 years, who said they thought they were entitled to their PRSI.  They were only two weeks unemployed and felt they were being put through the wringer in terms of lining up another job.  I cannot say what the Deputy has just said with the same conviction.  My experience is that the situation has tightened very significantly in recent times and the unemployment payment is only made available to those who can prove they are genuinely seeking work.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">I accept that in every part of life we will have people who will try to evade schemes and break the rules.  However, the fact the threshold has been reduced to three months makes it more difficult for such people to do so.  The Deputy is right to a certain extent, although I do not have exact percentages to hand——</p>

            <p eId="para_858">When the interviews take place in FÁS and with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, a very significant percentage of interviewees do not come back for a second interview and go back to employment.  That has been a feature of our plan and a very effective part of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">On the other hand, in the broad area of disability and unemployment, we must do better than we have done in the last decade.  In the time of the Celtic tiger, between 4% to 4.5% of our people were unemployed.  The challenge for us is to determine what we need to do to get those who have been almost permanently unemployed into the labour market.  There is an interdepartmental group, including the assistant secretaries of my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, working on that issue.  It is dealing with issues of poverty traps, secondary benefits, medical cards and so forth and aims to incentivise people to return to employment.  I accept that further work is needed in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">On the issue of the community employment programmes, we cannot have community employment forever.  There are approximately 22,000 places on community employment schemes.  We must recognise that a considerable amount of community employment schemes are now social support services or community support services.  The scheme has, over time, turned out to be a very good avenue for people with disabilities to obtain reasonable work experience which they were unable to obtain in the mainstream labour market.  I am examining the community employment issue in that context.</p>

However, with regard to community employment schemes, the Minister said they cannot go on forever.  I dispute that.  Why can we not have such schemes forever?  The work the participants are doing is very valuable.  I know we cannot have the actual term "community employment" forever, but people on those schemes are doing useful work.  Somebody has to do that work and why not allow them to continue through that scheme?</p>

            <p eId="para_862">The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, has developed the role of the social employment through the community services programme, which facilitates exactly what the Deputy has articulated.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">The fundamental mandate of the community employment programme originally was as a labour activation measure.  It was meant to be short term, to get people back into work.  It was never meant to be a community or social support programme.</p>

We recognised that social economy matters belonged there, not under a labour market measure.  In terms of labour market activation, there is potential within my Department and FÁS for the community employment scheme's functions in respect of a significant cohort of the population to be re-examined and redesigned.</p>

        <b>Deputy Olwyn Enright</b>
         asked the

         the links that exist between his Department and the local authorities and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government in educating small businesses on the planning process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_872">The provision of information in respect of the planning process is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities.  I understand that the Department provides documentation in respect of this issue, including the leaflet, "Planning for the Business Person".</p>
            <p eId="para_873">Enterprise development agencies operating under the aegis of my Department provide general advice and assistance to small businesses over a range of issues affecting the start-up and expansion of business.  The level and nature of the advice required differ from business to business depending on a business's stage of development, the particular business sector and the background and experience of the promoter involved.  These development agencies do not have any formal role in advising on planning matters and would refer such businesses to the planning department of the relevant local authority for information on the most appropriate course of action to take.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">Nevertheless, agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards have a strong working relationship with local authorities in ensuring that the proper business infrastructure is in place to nurture enterprises for their future development and growth.  We will keep this issue under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_875">While I thank the Minister for his answer, the question was meant to elicit a longer response, as it involved more than just the planning process, namely, working with local authorities.  Our business sector needs more guidance and advice on how to engage with local authorities and similar standards should apply in the dealings with each authority, which I am sure the Minister would accept.  It is his job to engage and help businesses in this respect because, unless one is a politician, understanding how local government works is a minefield.  Businesses should not need to knock on councillors' or Deputies' doors to get help.  While I accept this does not occur everywhere, the situation must be improved.  Some councils' planning and economic officers work well, but not all of them do.  We must level the playing field between councils.  Red tape and delays scare business away.  Contribution levies are bad enough without delays in the system.  There is an obligation on both Ministers to put their heads together to try to fast-track this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_876">This is the job of directors of enterprise, which are positions of employment in many local authorities.  I am glad the Deputy raised this question, as it gives me an opportunity to make a few points.  I am concerned that in some local authority areas, the issue of enterprise has fallen down the ladder.  Family enterprises and so on that have been in rural locations for 30 years or so are jumping many hurdles when it comes to planning the expansion of existing facilities.  We will not bring multinational companies to such rural locations.  People are being told to go 20 miles down the road to an urban centre.</p>

            <p eId="para_878">Yes, to set up one's business again.  Enterprise Ireland is giving grants to companies in terms of human resources, research and development and so on but, thanks to development levies, those grants are increasingly going from one State agency to the county manager.  Through the Small Business Forum, we made strong representations to the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that resulted in new guidelines being issued to local authorities.  However, even the high level group on manufacturing, which will shortly engage with the social partners, is highlighting the issue of local authority development levies and their impact on business and manufacturing.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">There was a time when local authorities hunted for business and jobs.  They also sought meetings with me, which is still the case, but there is a mismatch between that aspiration and policy objective and the reality on the ground in terms of planning, development levies and the overall attitude to business, which is no longer as pro-enterprise as I, as Minister, would like it to be.  This is particularly the case in rural Ireland, where we need to facilitate rather than penalise the traditional enterprises that have thrived for a long time.  This is a concern I share with my Government colleagues and we set up an interdepartmental group to activate the work of the Enterprise Strategy Group report and the Small Business Forum to determine whether we can get a more collective opinion on competitiveness in enterprise.</p>

            <p eId="para_880">The Minister is in a better position to get something done about this matter.  I hope we can knock heads in this regard and keep pushing it in the coming years.  This significant and important issue for rural Ireland in particular and the greater Dublin area must be taken seriously.  I accept that the Minister has done work in this area, but the issue must be pushed and certain Ministers should know more about it.</p>

            <p eId="para_881">I salute the Minister's efforts in respect of rural areas.  Coming from one of those areas as I do, our future may be bound to facilitating small and cottage industries.  County Westmeath is progressive in this regard, but could the Minister discuss this matter with local authorities?</p>
            <p eId="para_882">That some local authorities are not facilitative and are not seeking opportunities are issues that have been raised at the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, of which I am Chairman. Through the strategy group, can the Minister ensure a broad formula is sent to local authorities setting out the objectives of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Enterprise Ireland?  Any planning obstacles should be smoothed out and people should not make smokescreen objections to deter others from setting up in particular areas.  Instead of facilitating the important employment opportunities provided by small companies, perhaps too much attention is being paid to minimalist objections.</p>

            <p eId="para_883">I accept the broad thrust of Deputy Penrose's proposition, and that my Government colleagues and I have a collective responsibility in this regard that I must discharge.  I take on board the Deputy's opinion that my Department should meet local authority managers.  Traditionally, it was a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  On an individual basis, I meet local authority managers as I travel the country, but there may be a case to be made for a more formal approach.  Equally, I would be prepared to work with the committee of which the Deputy is Chairman to focus on this issue and to develop an Oireachtas policy framework.</p>

        <b>Deputy Andrew Doyle</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         if he has discussed with the Competition Authority their submission to the Government’s Alcohol Advisory Group that there should be no ban on below cost selling of alcohol; his views on such a proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [8455/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_471" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_889">The Competition Authority made a submission to the Government alcohol advisory group last month and, subsequently, made it available on its own website.  As the independent statutory agency responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State, the authority is entitled to respond to public consultations.  While I have not discussed the submission with the authority, I am aware of the opinions expressed therein.  I do not consider it appropriate, however, to comment on the submission, as the advisory group is considering all submissions made to it.  The authority is independent and I cannot interfere in its right to make submissions and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">The groceries order was not designed to tackle the issue of alcohol abuse, there is no evidence to suggest that it was capable of doing so and it was a wholly inappropriate mechanism by which to seek to control alcohol consumption.  The order was not a ban on selling below cost.  Rather, it prevented sale below invoice price.  In effect, it prevented sale at a price that could be, and often was, considerably above cost.  The re-introduction of a ban on below cost selling of alcohol will not result in the Government taking upon itself the power to set prices.  Rather, it will take the power of setting minimum prices for alcohol away from one element of the supply chain, the retailer, and handing it to another element, the wholesaler.  It will guarantee a margin to the retailer and the publican and, thus, increase the profits to be derived from selling alcohol.  Promoting the profitability of alcohol undermines the objective of reducing consumption and also penalises the moderate drinker.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">There is a perceived link between the abolition of the groceries order and increased alcohol consumption.  However, statistics published by the World Health Organisation show that, apart from a slight dip in 1983, alcohol consumption, measured in litres <i>per capita</i>, increased from 4.83 to 11.23 between the period 1970 and 2001.  The groceries order was in operation throughout that period and did not have an impact on this phenomenon.  Since 2002, average consumption has decreased very slightly from 11.22 litres to 10.61 litres in 2005.  Central Statistics Office figures indicate that the price of alcohol increased during the period from 1976 to 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">Combined, the WHO and CSO data clearly show year on year increases in alcohol consumption during a time when price control mechanisms were in place and when the price of alcohol also increased.  Price control mechanisms have in the past failed to halt the increase in consumption.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">I appreciate that the current level of alcohol consumption in Ireland is excessive and I am fully aware of the range of problems associated with excessive levels of consumption.  I welcome the establishment of the Government alcohol advisory group, which is indeed timely, and I will work with my colleague, the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to advance its objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">This is clearly an issue and we must focus on creating the best mechanisms to deal with the unacceptable manifestation of excessive alcohol consumption in our society.</p>

          <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_472">
            <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
            <p eId="para_895">There are many aspects to this debate.  I asked this question because I assumed the Department would be in discussion with the Competition Authority or one of its agents.  I understand that the authority is independent.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">The Minister may quote reports stating that the overall level of alcohol consumption has fallen but this is not the real issue.  Certain people are influenced by advertisements for the bulk-buying of alcohol at below-cost price, which can encourage over indulgence and the abuse of alcohol.  The issue is not the overall level of alcohol consumption but binge drinkers who cause problems at home, in families and on the street.  There is much evidence to suggest that the abolition of the groceries order has facilitated the below-cost selling of alcohol.  I understand that the groceries order was never meant to apply to alcohol but I was informed in a committee that the Minister was advised that this might be a byproduct of its abolition.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">As I said two weeks ago, I believe this could be a case where common sense should take precedence over ideology.  Perhaps the arrangements applying to alcohol, which allow big businesses to sell it cheaply, thereby encouraging its abuse through bulk buying, should be changed.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_473" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_898">The issue of alcohol is multifaceted and the advisory group established by the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is examining a range of issues.  I took this opportunity to put the groceries order debate in context.  Much alcohol is now imported and there are issues such as unit cost and selling price, which are provisions defined in legislation.  There is significant difficulty in trying to identify costs and one runs the risk of facilitating the importation of cheaper brands of alcohol from overseas, which was happening prior to the abolition of the groceries order.  Some of these brands have a higher alcohol content than the brands we are used to.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">The advisory group has also examined the significant increase in the number of supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations with off-licences and the manner and conditions of the sale of alcohol products in such outlets, including below-unit cost selling and special promotions.  It is looking at the number of special exemption orders, which permit longer opening hours, that are being obtained by licensed premises around the country and the use, adequacy and effectiveness of existing sanctions and penalties, particularly those directed at combating excessive and underage alcohol consumption.  A range of issues will come under the remit of the advisory group.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">I am open to debate on this issue but it is complex.  The previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform banned happy hours, special promotions and so on in pubs.  In my opinion there are issues we can deal with and under-age drinking and so on need attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_902">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">During 2007, the latest period for which data are available, 9,216 new jobs were created in IDA supported companies, of which 1,446 were created in the Border, midlands and western, BMW, region.  This figure represents 16% of all new jobs created that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">At present there are 184 IDA supported companies in the BMW region employing 26,430 people, which represents almost 20% of all IDA supported employment in the country.  The impact of FDI in Ireland goes much deeper than job creation alone.  The positive impact is visible in many key aspects of Irish life.  Foreign-owned companies are at the cutting edge of demand for high skills, advanced management training and business processes, which permeates the wider business community.  These companies have contributed to the broadening of the economic base in Ireland by fostering entrepreneurial activities and new start-up companies aimed at supporting and selling to foreign-owned companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">In line with the national spatial strategy, IDA is focused on delivering investments to all of the gateway and hub locations.  This strategy involves matching investor requirements with the competencies, infrastructure and critical mass of these locations to secure the maximum number of investments for Ireland.  The key sectors of focus for IDA are life sciences, information and communications technologies and high-value international services activities.  Of the five strategic sites currently being marketed by IDA Ireland, two are in the BMW region, one in Galway and one in Louth and another is on the way.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">The nature of foreign direct investment has changed and Ireland is now competing for premium mobile investments against the most advanced countries in the world.  As Ireland competes for investments at the highest end of the value chain the concept of scale is crucial to our economic destiny.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified and talented individuals, effective physical and digital infrastructure and the availability of sophisticated professional support services.  If we are to make progress in attracting FDI to the regions we need to continue our investments under the national development plan, NDP, and all economic and social stakeholders will need to commit to the goal of balanced regional development as envisaged in the national spatial strategy.  Future thinking and action must have a regional rather than a local bias and this requires a significant change in mindset.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">I am confident that the policies being pursued by the development agencies, together with the roll-out of the national development plan, will continue to bear fruit in terms of employment and investment in the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_911">The fact that the Minister is unaware of this target probably answers my question.  The target has not been reached in any year of the past seven years; levels of 36%, 41%, 44% and 45% were reached.  That the target has not been reached may be explained by the fact that nobody knows it exists.

There is an excellent, 75 acre, well-serviced site there.  What is being done to attract industries in the fields of technology, pharmaceuticals and services?

         the net gain in Industrial Development Authority generated jobs over the past five years; if he is satisfied with the net return to the State; his forecasts for IDA job creation in the next five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [8487/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_509" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_948">The Forfás annual employment survey shows that in five-year period from 2003 to 2007 the net gain in the numbers of new jobs created in IDA supported companies amounted to 4,623.  This relatively small net gain masks the fact that there has been a considerable churn in employment in client companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">The significance of foreign direct investment to Ireland's current economic prosperity and future growth should not be underestimated.  The level of FDI in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world.  Today employment in IDA companies directly accounts for over 136,000 jobs or 42% of industrial and financial employment in the economy.  The average salary in IDA supported companies in 2007 was almost €44,000, or 19% above the average industrial wage of €36,800.  This reflects the higher skills of the new positions being created by these investments.  IDA supported companies paid an estimated €3 billion in corporate tax in 2007.  They also accounted for approximately 85% of manufacturing company's exports.  They accounted for €15.87 billion in direct expenditure within the economy, comprised of €6.73 billion on payroll, €5.71 billion on services and €3.43 billion on Irish materials.  These investments have also generated significant indirect employment in indigenous sub supply and service companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">The impact of FDI in Ireland goes much deeper than job creation and financial contribution to the economy, the positive impact is visible in may key aspects of Irish life.  Foreign-owned companies are at the cutting edge of demand for high skills, advanced management training and of business process, which permeates the wider business community.  These companies are leading contributors to national research and innovation agenda through substantial capital and intellectual investment in company owned research facilities and in widespread collaboration with third level institutions and dedicated research institutions.  Through their success they have contributed to the broadening of the economic base in Ireland by linking to and fostering entrepreneurial activities and indigenous start-ups aimed at supporting and selling to foreign owned companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">I am satisfied that the expenditure incurred by IDA in attracting new inward investment represents significant value for money and an excellent return on investment for the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">While neither IDA Ireland nor I make forecasts as to the number of jobs to be created in any one year I am satisfied that the agency has a healthy pipeline of prospective new projects in place and, given the successes of the agency in previous years, I share their confidence that Ireland is well placed to secure significant investment for 2008 and the years ahead.</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
            <p eId="para_953">I agree that the IDA gets good value for money.  It came before the joint committee recently and it is clear it is doing a very good job for the money its gets.  There is no problem in that area.  When one includes the other agencies, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development, it averages out at approximately 2,500 net jobs per year.  We mentioned targets earlier.  I appreciate the Minister cannot predict exact numbers, but going forward would the Minister be happy with a net return of 2,500 to 3,000 jobs per year?  Should we aim higher or is there anything that can be done by the Department to improve that even further?  Some counties, I can name them if the Minister wishes but there are seven or eight on my list, are down a good deal of jobs over the years; they have experienced a net loss rather than net gain.  In general, are there any plans to increase the overall figure from 2,500 to 3,000 per year?</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_954">The question asks about the net gain.  That is a fair question because it amassed some of the bigger issues.  A total of 53,976 jobs was created over that period.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_956">That is a huge number.  Unfortunately 49,300 odd jobs were lost.  That reflects the churn in the economy.  Fortunately, over the past decade we have been in the strong position where we created many jobs in services and the indigenous sector improved.  We have had record job creation figures of 80,000 last year and 90,000 the previous year.  We have created more jobs than we have lost.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">In terms of the future, the 2007 business environment ranking of the economist intelligence unit ranked Ireland in tenth place globally out of 82 countries, naming it as one of the most attractive business locations in the world.  Once we continue to get that type of international recognition, in terms of the attractiveness of Ireland as a location, notwithstanding the significant global competition in terms of wage costs, emerging markets and emerging economies, we are confident we can continue to secure significant investments.  If one looks at the last month alone, we have had good quality investments from Zimmer in Shannon to Citco in Cork and Vistakon in Limerick, all high value.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_966">I will be parochial on this issue.  I am delighted to see the Minister has satisfied my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, with regard to Carlow-Kilkenny.  The same cannot be said for south Kildare area, where there are five IDA sites.  When I wrote to the Minister about this, he accepted he would meet me but that meeting never took place, unfortunately.  In the past five years, only three visits to south Kildare have been organised by the IDA and, of those, only one resulted in a second visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, can explain to the Minister that if one is travelling through Kildare in the morning, all one will see is a red necklace of cars ahead.  Everyone is travelling out of Castledermot, Athy, Monasterevin, Kildare and Kilcullen, where there has been no development for many years.  There has been a haemorrhage of jobs and a list as long as my arm of closures over the years.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">I hope the Minister will reconsider this issue.  I have continually put down questions on what the IDA intends to do with the lands.  All it has done is to put the Monasterevin GAA club off land it has not been able to sell for five years.  It is a joke.  I want the Minister to honour his commitment to meet the three Oireachtas Members from Kildare South, if that is the road he wants to take.  In the initial stages, he promised me he would meet me but it never happened.  If he wants to honour his commitment to meet, I have no problem who he meets.  However, there is a need to meet someone with regard to that area.  We have seen development in Carlow and other areas but, while there is an unemployment blackspot in south Kildare, there have been only three IDA visits in five years.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_969">To follow up on that point, the IDA sometimes holds blocks of land where projects did not work out for it.  We all accept that this land was bought in good faith.  Is it the Minister's intention to discuss with the IDA the possibility of it giving that land to local authorities?  While the IDA wants major industry in sectors such as the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, it could give these lands to local authorities or county enterprise boards at the market value at which it bought them, not at today's market value, which would ruin the local authorities and boards.  I do not suggest this would solve the problem raised by Deputy Wall.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">A number of people made submissions to the joint committee that an ideal way to give small start-up units an opportunity would be for the IDA to trade land with the local authorities or the county enterprise boards from the landbank it was not successful in marketing.  In this way, small indigenous industries would be given an opportunity to take off.  Perhaps this is the way forward.</p>

They made the point that as there is significant commuter traffic into Dublin in IT and life sciences, the people are all prepared to work in the county if the investors located there.  We have had good announcements from towns in Meath such as Navan and others.</p>

            <p eId="para_983">With regard to Deputy Penrose's point, the IDA has sold much land to county councils in recent times.  I am anxious that the land would continue to be used for employment purposes and indigenous purposes.  However, in order to build the sites at Oranmore and so on, it must charge the current market value.  It then uses that resource to provide better and more modern facilities to help attract quality investments, which has been the strategy for a number of years and enables us to undertake the projects in Oranmore, in County Louth and elsewhere.  In addition, the number of sites has reduced considerably.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">On a personal level, I was never a great supporter of the State selling land or having a sale here and there just for the sake of it.  I like the idea of selling to the county councils where there is no prospect of multinationals coming in but where we could get significant indigenous projects off the ground.  The indigenous story is important and growing.  That sector also needs property solutions, which is where we must focus.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_989">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Devins, to the House.  He will fully appreciate the current problems with a number of services in Kerry General Hospital as he has a close relative, a prominent consultant, working in the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">Some years ago, there was no public cardiologist service in Kerry.  At the time, I arranged a public meeting from which it was agreed that the Bon Secours private hospital in Tralee and Kerry General Hospital would co-operate in using a cardiologist.  Initially, this worked very well, with six units out of ten in the Bon Secours and four in Kerry General Hospital.  However, due to a lack of resources and support, the then cardiologist left and he has been replaced by consultant cardiologist, Dr. Carey, who is not happy with the type of support services he has for the public element of his contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">Just last week, an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> demonstrated clearly that Irish people are three times more likely to die from heart disease than those in France, Portugal and Italy.  Despite our country’s wealth, Ireland’s mortality rates from cardiovascular disease are as bad as those in less well-off eastern European countries such as Poland, Macedonia and Croatia.  In Ireland, Kerry has a higher rate of heart disease than any other part of the country.  More decisive action needs to be taken to come to terms with this problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">The recent Irish Life insurance figures showed that 31% of the deaths in Kerry were attributed to cancer and 31% to heart disease.  It is obvious heart disease is at an unacceptable level in Kerry.  Some 250 patients are currently on the waiting list for echocardiograms and more than 100 patients are on the waiting list for coronary angiograms.  Before Christmas, three patients who were on the coronary angiogram waiting list died.  If the treatment service had been available these three patients might not have died.  Another patient who was on the waiting list collapsed and had three stents inserted while on holiday in France.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">A number of initiatives should be taken which I will outline.  There is a need to upgrade and replace the current echocardiogram machine.  The finished quality and storage capacity of the current machine have deteriorated significantly in recent months and it does not allow for accurate assessment of diagnosis for two reasons.  First, the machine is eight years old and, second, the current model is obsolete.  In addition, a portable echocardiogram machine is required as a secondary machine for inpatient echocardiograms and ICU scans as the hospital is currently carrying out approximately 1,600 scans.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">There is also a need for adequate data storage.  Current echocardiograms are performed and reported on with the consultant on a single machine.  This restricts the number of echocardiograms that can be performed, as reporting schedules have to be scheduled at regular intervals.  A PC-based system would allow for off-line reporting to allow for increased scanning times.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">The quality of readings on the current stress test machine, which has been obsolete for a number of years, continues to deteriorate and needs to be replaced as a matter of urgency.  Because of his knowledge of and connection with Kerry General Hospital I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, not just to respond to the matter but to follow it up for the sake of people in Kerry where we have the highest rate of cardiovascular disease in this country.  Surely this warrants some type of action and reaction.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
            <p eId="para_996">I am taking the matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Harney, the Minister for Health and Children.  I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this important matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">The appointment of a full-time consultant cardiologist for Kerry General Hospital is a priority for the southern hospitals group of the Health Service Executive, HSE.  The management of the hospital itself is committed to providing the best possible quality of care to all its patients and is working with the National Hospitals Office of the HSE to further enhance the cardiology service at the hospital during the coming year.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">In line with the cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, published in 1999, investment in the development of cardiology services has taken place across the region, in both Cork and Kerry.  Kerry General Hospital received €503,778 over the first three years of the strategy to develop cardiology-related services.  This resulted in approval to recruit a number of staff, including four coronary care unit nurses, an occupational therapist, two student cardiac technicians, a cardiac rehabilitation sister and cardiac rehabilitation nurse, a dietician and a physiotherapist.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">In 2004, the fourth year of the strategy, €160,000 was allocated to begin the process of establishing a consultant cardiology service in Kerry with a full-year allocation of €476,000 in 2005.  This funding allowed the HSE south to appoint a cardiac technician, nurse and clerical support as well as providing certain non-pay costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">The strengthening of the infrastructure in Kerry General Hospital has so far enabled the hospital to develop a cardiac rehabilitation service, a cardiac non-invasive diagnostic service, to extend its telemetry service in the CCU, extend its resuscitation training programme and provide for ongoing staff training.  It has also ensured that essential cardiac equipment was procured for the cardiology service at the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">The HSE has advised my Department that currently a consultant cardiologist from the Bon Secours Hospital, Tralee, is working in a partnership arrangement with Kerry General Hospital, thus facilitating the development of specialist cardiology services.  Kerry General Hospital and the HSE southern area remain committed to enhancing the cardiology service at the hospital in line with Government policy and at the rate at which resources can be allocated.</p>

          <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_540">
            <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_1002">I have raised on a number of occasions the issue on home helps in the Kildare-west Wicklow area.  A total of 800 home helps do not receive travel expenses.  I have tabled numerous parliamentary questions on this matter.  The replies I received indicated that home helps in other areas are paid these expenses directly through the Health Service Executive and through voluntary organisations.  I am delighted this is happening, but why can the same not apply to home helps in the Kildare-west Wicklow area?</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">I have been told by letter that an exercise is currently in progress to establish entitlements on an individual basis to travel expenses and to make arrangements for the payment of same.  That has been ongoing since before Christmas but no progress has been made in resolving the matter.  Although we have computers we do not seem to be able to make progress in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">Parts of Kildare and west Wicklow are very rural.  As a result, most home helps have to travel and they have significant costs in terms of petrol and car maintenance in order to provide their service to people in the community every day.  There has been a reduction in the number of home help hours provided to people and this has resulted in more house calls being made by each home help.  This puts more pressure on the vehicles of home helps and increases the cost factor.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">The voluntary organisations appear to be able to pay such expenses but the HSE, in spite of PPARS and the other computer systems, is not able to pay people.  The latest reply I received from Eastern Community Works, ECW, in Kildare, which acts as paymasters to process payment for salaries only to home helps, indicated that the payment system used by ECW is limited in so far as it does not have the same capacity or flexibility as the HSE computer payments system.  Why are payments not transferred to the HSE computer system if it has the capacity to deal with them?  Why deprive these people who provide such a service?</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">Given that each home help probably helps up to five or six people, up to 2,000 people could be in receipt of home help assistance in County Kildare.  In spite of the great work they do, these people have not been provided with expenses in recent years.  This is the case despite the fact that ordinary voluntary organisations in other areas can provide a facility to pay these expenses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">I urge the Minister of State, for the sake of common sense, not to isolate these people who provide such a valuable service.  We must ensure that if the ECW is not in a position to provide the computer service that is required to calculate and ensure home helps get their money, then payments will be transferred to the main HSE computer in Millennium Park.  We must ensure payments are made.  It is naturally wrong that home helps in all other areas can get expenses, but not in Kildare and west Wicklow.  It is not logical to deprive one group of this payment, given the service they are giving and the need for proper transport.  Travel expenses would go toward ensuring the service could continue to be provided.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_541" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Devins</from>
            <p eId="para_1008">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank Deputy Wall for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to outline the situation regarding the payment of arrears due to home helps for travel expenses in the Kildare and west Wicklow area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">I am advised by the HSE that the home helps in Kildare and west Wicklow are employed by Eastern Community Works.  I understand the delay in payment in this case is due to technical difficulties in processing payments.  Work is ongoing to rectify these difficulties and information regarding outstanding claims is currently being gathered.  Staff affected can be assured that payments will be made as soon as possible, once these difficulties have been resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">It is our policy that services for older people should be developed and delivered in a such a way that enables them to be maintained at home with dignity and independence for as long as possible in accordance with their wishes, as expressed in many research studies.  Those older people who become ill or dependent should be restored to a level of independence at home.  The role of family, neighbours and voluntary bodies in caring for older people in their own community is also to be supported and actively encouraged.  The home help service is vital to the implementation of this policy.  The aim of the home help service is to enable people to remain at home, where appropriate, who might otherwise need to be cared for in residential care.  It is recognised that the home help service is an essential support to family and informal carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">On the specific area of home help services, an additional €33 million was given in 2006 which funded an extra 1.75 million home help hours.  This was augmented by a further €18 million in 2007 which resulted in 780,000 extra hours coming on stream.  The 2008 budget includes a further €4.6 million in additional expenditure by the HSE for 200,000 extra home help hours this year.  The executive expects to provide a total of around 11.98 million home help hours nationally in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">As part of the HSE's ongoing transformation programme there is a move to the provision of care in the community — primary care — and this is being supported by the introduction of primary care teams throughout the country.  Primary care teams should be the first access point for persons who need to access the health system.  It is intended that they will facilitate people's access into, through and out of the system and ensure quality care is provided in a manner that maximises the convenience for patient and clients.  Home helps will form a vital part of these teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">In preparation for this new role the HSE, SIPTU and IMPACT established a high level group in 2006 to review the existing models of home help service with a view to establishing a standardised high quality service that would benefit both clientele and staff.  A high level report was produced by this group in June 2007 and agreed by all parties.  These improvements will help to ensure clients will receive the same high level of service wherever they are located in the country, as well as meaning the staff and their valuable work are given the appropriate recognition and reward.</p>

            <p eId="para_1015">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for this opportunity to raise the issue of the Kentstown bus crash.  As we all know, almost three years ago five beautiful girls from County Meath lost their lives in that crash, which had a dreadful effect on their families, the local community and the whole country.  Three years later that incident is still on everybody's minds.  The families would like to get on with their lives.  Two days ago they had hoped the inquest into the deaths of their five girls could eventually be heard following a court case relating to this incident.  This court case has been postponed until next January.  The other children involved in the accident and the families would like to see this case brought forward.  They would like to put a chapter of their lives in its place.  Until the inquest is heard, this will not happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">Last night I met the five families together in one room.  They made it clear they want the inquest to take place and asked me to read this letter on their behalf:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1017">We, the parents of Lisa Callan, Sinead Ledwidge, Amy McCabe, Claire McCluskey and Deirdre Scanlon who lost their lives in the Kentstown bus tragedy would like to collectively put on record our disappointment and total frustration at the deferral of a scheduled court case relating to the bus accident.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1018">It is just not acceptable that we as parents, our extended families, along with our neighbours' children who were affected by the bus crash and the local community have to wait another year to have an inquest on our loved ones.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1019">We have suffered almost three long, hard years of hurt and pain.  We have tried to get on with our lives, especially for our other children, but until such time that the inquests take place, this will never happen.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1020">We do not accept the fact that a country such as ours does not have the court facilities or the judges available to proceed with the court case which would help bring an end somewhat to our grief and pain.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1021">We are asking the Government and the Court Service to bring this case forward immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">I am aware that the president of the Circuit Court is examining the possibility of arranging an earlier hearing for this case and if an available date is identified it will be offered to the other parties.  On humanitarian grounds I ask everybody to ensure this is done.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Devins</from>
            <p eId="para_1023">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has asked me to thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  He welcomes the opportunity afforded today to set out, in some detail, the developments under way in modernising and improving services to court users.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">The Courts Service was established as an independent body in November 1999.  The service was set up to manage the courts, support the Judiciary and provide a high quality and professional service to all users of the courts.  The responsibilities of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform include ensuring adequate funding for all parts of the criminal justice system, including the courts.  I am pleased to say €107 million was provided in the recent budget for the Courts Service in 2008.  This represents an increase of 5% on 2007.  The Deputy raises two issues, buildings and waiting times, and I will deal with them in turn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">Since its establishment, the Courts Service has been extremely successful in transforming the courts system in this State and this has been widely acknowledged.  The service is continuing the major programme of work to provide modern 21st century court buildings in all parts of the country.  The allocation for capital works on courthouses next year stands at nearly €30 million.  This funding will ensure our courthouse stock is maintained in good condition in keeping with its role as the public expression of the administration of justice in the State.  The achievements of the courts building programme are impressive.  A new, state-of-the-art criminal courts complex in Dublin is being constructed in Parkgate Street and is due for completion in 2010.  The building will concentrate all central Dublin criminal law business in one service location with 22 new court rooms.  This will involve the transfer of courts and administrative offices from three jurisdictions — District, Circuit and Central — to the new facility.  The centralisation of all criminal business in the new complex will also mean the Four Courts will be freed up for civil business.  This is a public private partnership project, PPP, and the biggest undertaking in the justice sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">Approval has been given to the Courts Service to proceed with nine other greenfield court projects by way of PPP as part of the new envelope of €50 million for such projects over the next two years.  Last year courthouse building and refurbishment projects were completed in Tullamore, Bray, Fermoy, Belmullet and Dolphin House in Dublin.  This year projects will be completed in Ardee, Thurles, Clones, Blanchardstown and Gorey.  Work will begin in 2008 in Kilkenny, Monaghan, Mullingar, Swinford, Manorhamilton, Wexford, Kilmallock, Killaloe, Youghal and Virginia.  This is an impressive list and stands as firm evidence of the ongoing efforts to improve our courthouses.  This level of development and modernisation is without precedent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">I do not list these projects merely to draw attention to the substantial investment the Government has made, but to highlight the resulting vastly improved facilities for all court users.  As well as the impact on waiting lists for criminal trials and civil cases, the new criminal courts complex is being planned with separate transit flows, so that victims and their families no longer have to wait in proximity with an accused person.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">The Government is firmly committed to ensuring that judicial resources are adequate to the demands placed on them.  Last year, the Courts and Court Officers (Amendment) Act 2007 provided for an additional 14 judges — six judges of the District Court, four judges of the Circuit Court and four judges of the High Court.  The additional judges were appointed to deal with delays and generally speed up the judicial process.  The waiting time between return for trial and trial in the Central Criminal Court — where the most serious cases are heard — was 18 months in 2002.  Today the waiting time for the hearing of cases is six months.  The strict application by the court of its own ground rules on adjournments——</p>

            <p eId="para_1030">——and the continuing good case management and careful scheduling of cases have all contributed to the significant reduction in waiting times and the optimum use of the judicial and other resources allocated to the court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">The situation in the Circuit Court and the District Court varies according to location.  While some venues are in a position to schedule cases for the next sittings, others are experiencing delays due to a variety of factors.  The president of each court has at his disposal unassigned judges who can be used to assist permanently assigned judges where pressure of work demands it.  If more judges are required, they will be appointed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">The Deputy referred to a particular case.  The allocation of court business is a matter for the Judiciary.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no function in the area.  However, I can make some general comments about the tragic case in question and I assure the families involved that everything possible will be done to bring this matter to a speedy conclusion.  This case was listed for hearing at Trim Circuit Court.  As there were understandable difficulties in empanelling a jury locally in County Meath, the presiding judge transferred the case to Dublin for hearing.  In criminal cases, priority must always be given to those cases where the defendant is in custody.  The defendants in this case are not in custody.  The case was listed for hearing on 26 February 2008.  However, all available judges were already hearing cases and it was not possible for the case to proceed.  The President of the Circuit Court is now examining the possibility of arranging an earlier hearing date.  If an available date is identified, it will be offered to the parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">The scheduling of court cases in the Circuit Court is a matter for the president of that court and the presiding judge who are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1035">I want to raise the general issue of citizenship applications and to illustrate the difficulties by referring to a specific case.  It is my information that at this stage there are more than 17,000 applications for citizenship awaiting decision within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The citizenship section of that Department is overwhelmed by the number of applications with which it must deal.  It is incapable of communicating on any reasonable basis with anyone who raises specific queries, including Members of this House.  It is completely unable to provide a customer friendly service.  Letters from Deputies, Senators, or members of the general public seeking a citizenship application go directly to the section, but then it all disappears into a black hole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">People's lives are being kept on hold while citizenship applications are languishing undecided in the Department for two, three and four years.  An example of the difficulties confronting people is illustrated by the case of Mr. Steven Phillips.  He came to Ireland in 2000.  He has a work permit and has worked here lawfully ever since.  He is employed by a leading firm of architects.  Mr. Phillips has been involved in a variety of projects of great importance.  He was involved in the layout of the conferences during the last European Union Presidency in 2004 and got a Garda clearance for that work.  He was a project architect manager for the renovation and refurbishment of the third floor of the premises of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at 94 Saint Stephen's Green.  He was the project manager for the new offices of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in Killarney.  He was involved as project manager in the refit of the offices provided for the new Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  He also was one of two people from his firm who went to Saint Fintan's Cemetery in Sutton to carry out a survey of that cemetery, in order to ensure that proper facilities would be available at the funeral of former Taoiseach Charles Haughey for the dignitaries and others who were to attend, including the media.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">Having lived and worked in Ireland on a number of important projects over five years, he applied for citizenship.  He applied in December 2005 and he received a response in February 2006, which informed him that his application would be examined further at some time in 2008.  In November 2006, he sought a long-term residence permission so that he would not have to renew his residence permission annually.  He wrote to the Minister in desperation on 3 July 2007 regarding his application for citizenship and his long-term residence application.  He asked whether someone could just deal with the matters, whether someone could respond to some queries he had made, and whether there was any remote chance that his citizenship application might be processed.  He received an acknowledgement from the Department on 16 July 2007, but there has been silence since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">In one of the letters of acknowledgement he received at an early stage, he was asked not to write too often to the Department, because it might get in the way of processing applications.  It is now two and a quarter years since this man applied for citizenship.  Based on the backlog of cases, there is a realistic possibility that his application may not be processed until 2009 or 2010.  This is gross maladministration. It is an indication of a public service incapable of providing public service.  The public service is treating with contempt applications for Irish citizenship made by foreign nationals lawfully working in this country.  It is particularly ironic at a time when we in this State are urging members of the US Congress to grant long-term residence and citizenship to Irish illegals who have been working there for years.  This is an example of an individual lawfully working in Ireland — incidentally, he married an Irish citizen a year ago — who would like to be granted Irish citizenship so that he could get on with his life.  He and his wife would like to purchase a home for themselves and possibly start their own business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">There is a blockage in all of this.  It is not just in the fact that the Department has not processed his citizenship application, but in the fact that he cannot even get any information from the Department.  I appreciate the tolerance of the Ceann Comhairle, but I ask that this man's citizenship application be assessed.  He already has a security clearance and is obviously self-supporting.  He has been involved in jobs on behalf of the Government.  I ask that he be granted the citizenship he is seeking.  Pending that, someone should at the very least deal with his application for long-term residence, upon which a decision should have been made six months ago.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Devins</from>
            <p eId="para_1040">I speak on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">The existing processing time for applications for certificates of naturalisation is approximately 30 months from the date the application is received until such time as the applicant is informed of the Minister's decision.  This is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in recent years.  The number of applications received in 2007 was 8,003, an increase of almost 100% on the number received just three years previously.  It appears that this upward trend is set to continue for the foreseeable future.  The Minister shares the Deputy's concerns regarding processing times and I understand he has recently allocated additional resources to the citizenship section of his Department so that several categories of applicant can be dealt with more expeditiously than at present.  These include refugees, spouses of Irish citizens and applications made on behalf of minors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, at his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  These conditions are that the applicant must be of full age or, by way of exception, be a minor born in the State; be of good character; have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded.  These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a manner which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who are suitably qualified.  Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Approximately one third of all applications for naturalisation received are not completed correctly, necessitating the forms and accompanying documentation being returned to the applicant with an explanation of the problem involved.  Valid applications are examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and inquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.  Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, more than 3,500 applicants who applied since that date have been found to have insufficient residency in the State for the purposes of naturalisation.  All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency and will be able to re-apply when they have the required residency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">The next stage of the process involves assessing an applicant's financial status in respect of his or her ability to support himself or herself in the State.  Inquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time, inquiries are also made with the Garda Síochána to ascertain if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  There may also be circumstances in individual cases which require a greater level of investigation than other cases.  Once all inquiries are completed, the file is referred to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">These procedures have been developed and refined over a number of years and the Minister is satisfied they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.  The Deputy will appreciate that these processes can, by their nature, take some time to complete.  Consequently, having regard to the resources available, which are kept under constant review, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved.  The Minister has, however, instructed his officials to undertake a review of the various processes in order that these might be streamlined further where possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1048">Should an individual wish to make inquiries, a citizenship helpline operates in the citizenship section of the Department and this is open to public representatives and members of the public.  The helpline operates each Tuesday and Thursday between 10 a.m. and 12.30 p.m.  In 2007, in excess of 10,000 calls were processed on this helpline.

            <p eId="para_1053">Officials in the citizenship section are processing applications received in mid-2005 and have approximately 1,000 applications on hand to be dealt with before that of the person concerned.  These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. It is likely therefore that the individual in question might expect to receive a decision in his case in the coming months.</p>

            <p eId="para_1055">Primary responsibility for policy in relation to Childcare is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Children, at the Department of Health and Children. The Childcare Directorate of that Office has responsibility for implementing the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010.  The strategy aims to further develop the childcare infrastructure to meet the needs of children and their parents for quality early childhood care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">The National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 is a major programme of investment in childcare infrastructure.  €575 million has been allocated to the 5-year programme, including €358 million for capital investment.  It is anticipated that the programme will create up to 50,000 new childcare places, with the objective of assisting parents to access affordable, quality childcare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">The programme will develop quality childcare supports and services, delivered at local level through the City and County Childcare Committees under the coordination of Pobal. Capital grants to develop childcare facilities are available to childcare providers in both the private and community sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">My Department is responsible for chairing and providing the secretariat for the National Framework Committee on Work Life Balance Policies. This Committee, which was established under the social partnership process, comprises representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Equality Authority and a number of Government Departments.  The Committee has undertaken and continues to undertake a range of activities to raise awareness and encourage the provision of work-life balance at the level of the enterprise, including the provision of financial assistance to organisations, the provision of expert assistance to individual organisations via a Panel of Consultants which was established in November 2007; information dissemination activities, seminars, research etc.  29th February is Work Life Balance Day 2008, an initiative conceived by the Framework Committee in 2001 and has become an annual event ever since.  The establishment of facilities such as gymnasia in the workplace is a matter for individual employers themselves.</p>

            <p eId="para_1062">The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have informed me that their agencies do not operate border exit controls.  Accordingly, data on the skill levels or other characteristics of emigrants are not available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1070">The Government is fully committed to developing and training the national workforce. We will invest €7.7 billion in that endeavour over the lifetime of the National Development Plan to the year 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">The National Skills Strategy details a broad vision of what our skills profile should be by 2020.  It maps necessary upskilling of those in jobs to underpin a knowledge-based economy. It involves an additional half a million people progressing by at least one level on the National Framework of Qualifications over that time period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">It therefore follows that all workers, including those currently employed in companies facing a precarious future, will have to commit to continuing training and learning. There is an important public role to be delivered in encouraging and facilitating those workers to enhance their skill levels and qualifications, acquire new skills in new areas and renew and update existing capabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">To facilitate this transition the key training providers under the auspices of my Department have responsibility for delivering necessary training to those in employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">FÁS through their One Step Up programme is encouraging employees to increase their competency levels and promoting an ethos of lifelong learning in the workplace. Its key intervention in this regard is the Competency Development Programme.  It offers workers different types of training programmes directed at various skill levels across major economic sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">Skillnets Limited, an enterprise-led support body, also seeks through their Training Networks Programme to enhance the skills of workers and improve employability and competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">This year alone my Department will invest €77 million in training those in employment. The objective is to reach about 86,000 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">The implementation plan for the National Skills Strategy will address ways of encouraging employees to increase their commitment to, and participation in, workers education and training. It will be elaborated by an Inter Departmental Committee to be chaired by the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Sean Haughey, and comprising officials from both our Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">FÁS, working in tandem with other State organisations, have an impressive track record in assisting in pre-redundancy and post-redundancy situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">Such intervention will typically include interviewing, assessing and advising those who wish to explore alternative employment and/or retraining options. Training interventions and other supports would then be provided. The core objective is to get workers transferred to equivalent employment, or equipped to take up alternative job options as quickly as possible.  Early intervention is key.  Accordingly, FÁS — with its network of offices around the country — is constantly monitoring employment developments at local level and engaging with employers to be in a position to have forward knowledge of any negative developments in prospects.  This is an important task and the way it is delivered will be periodically monitored and necessary adaptations made.</p>

            <p eId="para_1081">The Climate and Energy proposals published by the Commission on 23rd January are a complex package which raise economic and social issues for Ireland and thus require careful consideration on an all-Government basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">The Commission package includes the following elements:</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">The separation of the EU Emissions Trading Sector (ETS) from the rest of the economy through the creation of a single EU-wide Emissions Trading Sector which will be administered by the Commission and has an EU-wide target of reducing emissions to 21% below 2005 levels by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">For the non-ETS sectors of the European economy (essentially transport, agriculture, residential and non-ETS enterprises), the Commission has proposed national targets, with a very challenging target of reducing emissions to 20% below 2005 levels by 2020 being proposed for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">National renewable energy targets, with a target of 16% of all energy usage to be derived from renewable sources by 2020 being proposed for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">In addition to the foregoing, the package also includes a proposal for a legal framework on Carbon Capture and Storage technology, and new guidelines for environmental state aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">In view of the complex, interlinking nature of the Commission package, any work to assess the competitiveness and employment implications for industry of the proposed national target for the non-Emissions Trading Sector of reducing emissions by 20% below 2005 levels by 2020 has to encompass the other elements of the package.  It is for this reason that the analysis of the socio-economic implications of the Commission package for all sectors of the Irish economy is being undertaken under the auspices of the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  The Cabinet Committee, of which I am a member, is chaired by the Taoiseach.  To ensure that the analysis is as robust as possible, relevant stakeholders, including the Social Partners, are being consulted on the proposals, and a Technical Advisory Steering Group has been established to oversee the analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">Negotiations on the Commission package, which commenced this month, will be a comprehensive and complex process which is not expected to be completed until next year.  The Government has written to the Commission signalling that it expects detailed engagement on the package of proposals as a necessary prerequisite to any political agreement on the package.  The detailed analysis which is being overseen by the Technical Advisory Steering Group under the auspices of the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security will form the basis of Ireland's negotiating position.</p>

            <p eId="para_1090">The number of trade missions undertaken in the past five years is listed below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">Enterprise Ireland surveys participating companies within a few weeks of each Trade Mission to evaluate the effectiveness of the event and to gather comments and suggestions from their clients.  This information is then used to improve and modify future events.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">Ministerial-led Trade Missions are an integral part of this Department's work to develop and expand Ireland's exports to existing and new markets abroad. It has been the experience of my Department, and of the companies participating in such missions, that the presence of a Minister enhances the opportunities for the companies involved and achieves a higher level of recognition and access for companies to the various target markets.  During my term as Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment since 2004, missions led either by myself or by one of my Ministers of State have proven very successful and significant opportunities have resulted for the companies involved, with consequent benefits for Irish trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">I have been closely involved in several Taoiseach-led Trade Missions each January. As just two examples of the success of such Trade Missions for the expansion of our exports, I would like to point out that in the year following the Trade Mission to India in January 2006, total exports increased by 38% on the previous year.  In the case of the Trade Mission to the United Arab Emirates in 2007, while data for the full year 2007 are not yet available, it seems likely that merchandise exports to that country will have increased by about 36% compared to 2006 and, in the case of Saudi Arabia, which was also part of that 2007 Mission, the likely increase in such exports for last year will be about 11%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">For the first half of 2008 we envisage a total of 11 such Trade Missions.  Exact details for the rest of this year have not yet been finalised but it is likely that the total for the full year will be in the region of twenty missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">Details of the number of Ministerial-led Trade Missions undertaken in the last 5 years are as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_1109">The Minister for European Affairs, Mr. Dick Roche T.D., is spearheading a comprehensive national information and publicity campaign on the various facets of the Lisbon Treaty.  All Ministers will be working at every opportunity over the coming weeks and months to explain the Treaty to all sections of society. My contribution to this debate will include a particular focus on the business sector and on workers. The Government has recently published an explanatory pamphlet and a 22-page guide on the Treaty and it has set up a dedicated website, www.reformtreaty.ie, with a wide range of information on the Treaty. This document describes the Treaty's main provisions and explains their significance.  It is written in straightforward, accessible language and anyone who reads this Guide should become well acquainted with this Treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">On 14th February last, a Consolidated Text of the EU Treaties was published, a copy of which has been put in every library in the country.  A White Paper is also being prepared for publication next month. It will contain a thorough analysis of the Treaty's provisions and their importance for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs has already had discussions with both IBEC and ICTU representatives in order to generate debate on the Lisbon treaty and to ensure that the public may glean useful information in advance of the Referendum.  It is worth recording that IBEC is positively disposed to the Treaty and consider that it is worthy of support.  I would exhort the business sector, in general, to make its important voice heard on the positive aspects of this Treaty. Information on the Treaty is being disseminated through IBEC's own networking structures and in its publicity material. I am pleased to note that in recent weeks, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland have also called for a yes vote.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">The National Forum on Europe is also playing a leading role in facilitating public debate on the Treaty.  The Forum began an intensive information programme on the Treaty on 31st January 2008 when the Taoiseach took part in a debate on the Treaty with Forum Members in Dublin Castle. A series of public regional meetings are also being held. The Forum has also produced a summary guide to the Treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">The next phase of European consolidation and restructuring which the Treaty provides for will help the EU to prepare for the increasing rigours of globalisation and competition. The Lisbon Treaty will provide us with a new basis on which to operate institutionally so that we can tackle efficiently and effectively these great challenges that lie ahead.  The Treaty is a further stage of development, an incremental and rational step to update and modernise the Union's rules and focus which is essential for the effective operation and functioning of the enlarged Union and the single market.  Indeed, the Forfás review of the single market, which I recently launched, found that the single market has been important both for the growth and diversification of Irish trade and for enhancing the attractiveness of Ireland for foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1114">The Treaty will allow Ireland to continue to create a business-friendly environment, one which has seen the level of employment here more than double the level when we joined the then EEC, in 1973. The Treaty will allow Ireland to continue to be an attractive location for foreign direct investors.</p>

            <p eId="para_1122">The Government is fully committed towards strengthening the competitiveness and productive capacity of the economy. Within the shared economic principles of T2016, Government has shaped its strategic policy, as set out in the Programme for Government and more recently in the December Budget statement, towards securing those objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">The National Competitiveness Council's Annual Competitiveness Report 2007 has identified three areas essential to improving our competitiveness position: costs, productivity growth and promoting an innovation intensive economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">I agree with the NCC that, as part of our economic policy, seeking to maintain low inflation, promoting competition, the pursuit of sensible incomes policy, and keeping public spending growth at sustainable levels in the medium term are important. Doing this will allow us to keep the burden of taxation low, thus helping to maintain competitiveness and to maximise our economic potential. These are all part of our strategy to improve the cost environment and to enhance competitiveness.  The Anti-Inflation Group which was reconstituted under Towards 2016 has actively engaged with the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) with a view to co-ordinating and driving the fight against inflation on an informed basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">There are several ways in which my Department is actively trying to improve productivity growth. I announced the establishment of the Management Development Council in May 2007. The Council brings together the key providers and users of SME management development training in Ireland. The Council has been charged with examining existing management development provision, while profiling gaps and proposing solutions to address them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">The enterprise Agencies are actively promoting more effective use of ICT among their client companies, also in an effort to improve productivity. Productivity improvements at firm level are vital to export competitiveness but the onus is on firms to work with our agencies to access the expertise available to improve their export capabilities.  Enterprise Ireland's Productivity Improvement Fund provides support for capital equipment and automation as well as technology acquisition and the essential training and skills to optimise the use of new technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">The Government has set a goal to become a leader in Research &amp; Development and Innovation and has committed a budget of €8.2 billion under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI) 2006-2013 towards achieving this goal. The objective of the Strategy is to build stronger relationships between the science and enterprise systems, particularly in application and commercialisation of R&amp;D. It also aims to ensure the sustained development of human resources in science and technology. Our goal is to translate the NDP commitment in this area into a tangible return in terms of quality jobs, knowledge output and Irish competitiveness.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1131">I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 46 and 47 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has been established on an interim basis since February 2007. The Authority will be established on a statutory basis on the enactment of new Employment Law Compliance legislation which I propose to publish shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">A budget allocation of €8.553 million was provided for NERA for 2007 and this has increased to some €10.8 million for 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">The three units which were formally part of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been subsumed into NERA — the Employment Rights Information Unit, the Labour Inspectorate and the Prosecution / Enforcement Unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">Department of Finance sanction was secured for a total staff complement for NERA of 141, including an increased complement of 90 Labour Inspectors. The Director of NERA was appointed and took up duty on 12 February 2007. The Director is supported in his role by a management team including legal and accounting expertise and an administrative staff which are now fully in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">Considerable progress has been made in the recruitment and deployment of Labour Inspectors over the past year with 50 of the additional 59 inspector positions now filled. A further 5 inspectors are due to commence on the 3rd of March 2008 and the appointment of inspectors to fill the 4 remaining posts is progressing. Due to success in recent internal Departmental competitions and internal Departmental transfers, 5 of the original 31 inspector posts are now vacant and therefore, currently, there are 76 inspectors in the National Employment Rights Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">As part of the Government's decentralisation programme, NERA established its headquarters in Carlow at the end of July 2007. The Social Partnership Agreement "Towards 2016" also provided that Inspection Services would be established on a regional basis. In this regard, regional Inspection Services offices are now operating in Carlow, Shannon, Sligo, Cork and Dublin. Staff attached to the Shannon and Sligo offices are in temporary accommodation pending the completion of a new build and the fitting out of offices respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">In line with the commitment under "Towards 2016", joint investigation activity and exchange of information has commenced with Inspectors from NERA, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The necessary legislative provisions to enable the exchange of information between the three bodies came into effect on 30th March, 2007 with the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">NERA launched a major public awareness campaign on the 14th of January 2008 to introduce it to the general public.  The style of the campaign is open, accessible and approachable, focusing in the first instance on NERA's role in providing information on employment rights related to questions that arise in the modern Irish workplace whether from employers or employees.  The integrated campaign will be ongoing throughout 2008 across the full range of media including TV, radio, national and regional press, specialised publications, outdoor and web based advertising. The key message of the campaign is "Employment Rights, it's the law, you need to know".</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">The launch of NERA's website, www.employmentrights.ie, is also an important resource for employers and employees alike.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">NERA continues to consult with its range of stakeholders and has initiated a structured dialogue with the parties to the Social Partnership Agreement, ICTU, IBEC and the Construction Industry Federation on the development of a comprehensive and responsive system of employment rights compliance and enforcement. NERA invited its key stakeholders to a briefing on the 10th of January in respect of its activity and National Awareness Campaign.  NERA also engaged constructively during 2007 with other stakeholder organisations such as the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and the Citizen Information Centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">I am delighted with the excellent progress made to date in the establishment of the new Authority. In its first year of operation in 2007, NERA carried out some 14,400 inspections and recovered some €2.5m in arrears for workers.  Specific inspections campaigns were targeted at enforcing the minimum wage, protecting young workers and at the construction sector. Over 93,000 calls seeking information on employment rights were received by NERA in 2007. NERA also continued with its prosecution remit with 98 cases being referred to the Chief State Solicitors Office in 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_1144">The Forfás report on its "Review of the European Single Market", which was undertaken at the request of my Department and which was published earlier this month, found that although Irish consumers were enjoying real benefits from the single market in terms of the range of available goods and services, the price of some goods and services were higher in Ireland than in many other member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">The January 2008 Consumer Price Index published by the Central Statistics Office shows that inflation in Ireland continues to fall and that consumer prices decreased by 0.5% in January with a consequent fall in the annual rate of inflation to 4.3% down from 4.7% in December 2007. In terms of comparisons with other member states, the EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, as recorded in the CSO's bulletin, shows that the annual rate of inflation decreased from 3.2% in December to 3.1% in January which is 0.1% less than the annual rate for December 2007 for the harmonised index for the EU as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">Notwithstanding these welcome reductions in the rate of inflation, it is a matter of concern that the price of certain goods and services in Ireland remains high. Government action in terms of tackling price inflation is focussed on promoting competition, choice and raising consumer awareness in relation to price and value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">In relation to the price of services, the Forfás report, in quoting the findings of previous surveys of Eurostat found that the cost of some services to Irish consumers was considerably higher than the cost of such services to consumers in many other member states of the EU. The Deputy will be aware of the recent adoption of the Directive on Services in the Internal Market (2006/123/EEC) and the fact that member states are obliged to transpose this Directive by December 2009. The free movement of people, goods and services across EU borders, providing greater choice and price competition, is one of the main benefits the EU has to offer its citizens and businesses. In this regard, the Directive is intended to create a genuine single market for commercial services and is a key provision of the Lisbon agenda. It creates a framework to enable service providers, who are mostly SMEs, to become established in another Member State or to provide services to another Member State without being established there, thereby providing consumers throughout the Union, including Irish consumers, with much greater choice in terms of the provision of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">The transposition of the Directive will facilitate cross-border provision of commercial services. The Directive contains important provisions on administrative co-operation between Member States, provisions which are intended to generate trust and confidence between them as well as giving consumers and service providers the confidence to engage in cross-border transactions. Forfás has estimated that the Directive will benefit the Irish economy to the tune of approximately €300 million per annum, mostly through access to services by Irish consumers at more competitive prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">I am confident that the initiatives being undertaken by bodies such as the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, the impact of specific legislation such as the Services Directive in terms of greater choice and availability of services together with the vigilance of consumers themselves will have the effect of ensuring that Irish consumers do not pay unnecessarily high prices when purchasing goods and services.</p>

            <p eId="para_1151">The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) were set up in 1993 to provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">A fundamental review of the role of the CEBs in the development of the micro-enterprise sector in Ireland was conducted during 2004. This comprehensive review largely endorsed the activities and operations of the CEBs and concluded that there is justification for continued state support to micro-enterprises and that the CEB network can continue to play a key role in the overall delivery of a national enterprise policy.  The role of the CEBs in embedding an entrepreneurial culture in Ireland was further endorsed in both the Enterprise Strategy Group Report and the Report of the Small Business Forum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1153">The CEBs provide both financial and non-financial assistance and through the provision of such support they have been central in assisting many micro-enterprises to develop their growth and export potential and, over time, to develop sufficient mass to access the services of Enterprise Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154">In 2007 alone over 900 projects received grant aid and over 2,200 net jobs were created in CEB assisted enterprises.  In addition over 20,000 people participated on various CEB sponsored training courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">In 2008 the total budget allocation for the 35 CEBs stands at over €33m of which over €20m is available for Capital expenditure alone. I believe that this level of funding is adequate in order to enable the CEBs to fulfill their remit in maximizing entrepreneurial development in the micro-enterprise sector throughout the country. It is my intention that an appropriate level of financial support for the CEB network will continue to be made available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1156">I am satisfied that the CEBs have made a significant contribution to the economic progress in Ireland over the last decade and I envisage that they will continue to play a central role in the ongoing development of indigenous enterprise particularly in the micro-enterprise sector. The recent establishment of the Central Coordination Unit within Enterprise Ireland will enhance the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of the CEBs.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1158">I am satisfied that sufficient priority is being given to the enforcement of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 insofar as the inspection activities of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) are concerned. This is demonstrated by the number of National Minimum Wage Act inspections undertaken by NERA, amounting to 2,002 and 1,942 in 2006 and 2007 respectively, and by the breach detection rate which averaged almost 8% over the period 2006 and 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">NERA reserves the right to initiate prosecutions in all cases where breaches of employment legislation within its remit are detected. However, NERA's primary focus in such cases is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including redress for the employees concerned and payment of any arrears due to those employees. In this regard, NERA recovered, in 2007, almost €125,000 in arrears due to employees arising from breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act. The Deputy will be aware that NERA recovered almost €2.5 million in arrears in total in 2007 arising from breaches of this and other employment rights legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">Decisions in relation to the initiation of proceedings must have regard, among other matters, to the nature and circumstances of the breach, the employer's engagement insofar as rectifying the breaches and paying any arrears due are concerned, legal advice and the value from a public interest and value for money perspective, in such circumstances, of pursuing the matter through the judicial system. It should be noted that in the majority of cases employers are extremely cooperative in relation to rectifying breaches of employment law brought to their attention by NERA inspectors and paying any associated arrears. NERA will pursue breaches through the Courts in circumstances where such cooperation and full restitution are not forthcoming within a reasonable period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">The Deputy should be aware that Rights Commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission also hear complaints concerning breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.</p>

            <p eId="para_1222">Department Decentralisation</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">My Department has been making good progress in the relocation of the required 250 posts to Carlow under the Government's Decentralisation Programme.  The following business units/Offices of my Department are earmarked for decentralisation:</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">Companies Registration Office/Registry of Friendly Societies</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">National Employment Rights Authority (NERA)</p>

            <p eId="para_1227">Redundancy Payments Section</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">Insolvency Payments Section</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">Officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30th 2007.  The number of posts in this decentralised advance office is 100.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">As well as staff already decentralised, there are 44 staff within my Department due to decentralise in the substantive move scheduled for 2009, with a further 32 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned from other Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">With regard to the property side of the Department's move, the OPW completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre for the construction of my Department's permanent office in Carlow.  My colleague Minister of State Noel Ahern TD, announced on 13th December 2007 that the OPW has invited The Macquarie Partnership as the consortium to become the ‘Successful Tenderer' in respect of this decentralisation project.  This forms part of a major PPP project, which also involves the provision of office accommodation for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Portlaoise and the Department of Education and Science in Mullingar.  I am hopeful, subject to no planning issues arising, that the completion of construction of the permanent office will be in late 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">Agency Decentralisation</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">Under the Government Decentralisation Programme, announced in December 2003, six of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise or have already been decentralised, as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">FÁS</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">Under the Government's decentralisation programme, FÁS is due to transfer its head office including some 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">FÁS has completed the purchase of 5.59 acres (approximately) in Birr, Co Offaly.  A Planning Application for the FÁS portion of the site access road and site entrance is currently being progressed on behalf of FÁS by the vendor's Consultant Engineers and Architects, in discussion with the Consulting Engineers and Architects representing FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">In the meantime, since 6 May 2007 FÁS has leased a floor of a building within the Birr Technology Centre to accommodate staff in the decentralised location pending the construction and fitting out of a permanent Headquarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">Enterprise Ireland</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">Enterprise Ireland (EI) is to move 300 posts to Shannon under the decentralisation programme. Progress on the full transfer of EI's HQ to Shannon, within the Government decentralisation programme, will be influenced by factors (many exogenous to EI) such as; the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants and by progress made discussions at a central level on various issues central to Agency decentralisation.  EI's latest understanding is that there are 7 internal applicants interested in moving to Shannon.  None of these has yet re-located.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">In parallel with the decentralisation programme, EI has been strengthening its regional focus in recent years. EI now has a major new presence in the Shannon region in addition to its nine other regional offices. In July 2007 EI officially opened its new National Regional Development Headquarters in Shannon and has based the new County Enterprise Support Unit there. Currently there are 40 staff working in the new Shannon office and it is expected that approximately 65 EI staff will be in place there over the coming months.  EI has leased high-spec office space in Westpark, Shannon, to accommodate this new Regional HQ.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">In terms of acquiring a building, Enterprise Ireland, working closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW) has identified, but not yet acquired, a preferred site for the construction of a suitably sized new HQ building in Shannon.  The preferred site is a 13-acre site owned by Shannon Development.  In co-operation with Shannon Development and the OPW, the site was valued and a feasibility study carried out.  The site occupies a prime position in Shannon and is considered suitable for a major landmark building or civic structure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">Health and Safety Authority</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co Kilkenny as part of the decentralisation programme.  To date a total of 65 civil and public servants, including 12 Authority staff, have expressed an interest through the Central Application Facility (CAF) process in transferring to Thomastown.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">In advance of decentralising to Thomastown, the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city.  Currently, 27 staff, including 3 of the 12 internal HSA Thomastown applicants, are based in Kilkenny, and including also new staff recruited for the REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) strategy. All staff currently accommodated in the interim office will move to Thomastown once the new premises are ready for occupation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">The Commissioners of Public Works have signed a contract for sale in respect of the site in Thomastown.  A condition of the contract is that the vendor obtains the appropriate zoning for the site so that the Commissioners' planned development can take place.  The required change of zoning has now been granted and the sale should close shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">When the purchase is completed, expressions of interest for the design and build phase, will be invited from interested parties.  It will be a matter for the successful tenderer to apply for planning permission at that stage.  The current estimated timeline for availability for occupancy is 2009/2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">NSAI</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">Under the Government's decentralisation programme the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is due to relocate to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.  The number required to decentralise from the NSAI is 132.  A total of 10 Dublin based staff of the NSAI have applied to decentralise to Arklow.  In addition a further 86 Dublin based civil and public servants have applied for decentralisation to Arklow.  No staff from the NSAI have transferred to Arklow to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">The accommodation requirements for the NSAI in Arklow are being addressed by the OPW.  To date no progress has been made by the OPW in identifying or securing suitable office accommodation in the Arklow area.  The current NSAI implementation plan anticipates a target date of April 2009 as the completion date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">National Consumer Agency (NCA)</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">The National Consumer Agency (NCA) was formally established on 1st May 2007 and inherited the functions of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs (ODCA). The Agency will have a headquarters in Cork City.  The Department of Finance has granted sanction for an overall complement of 80 members of staff.  It is expected that there will be a high percentage of staff turnover as many of the existing staff, who formerly worked in ODCA and are on secondment from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, return to the Department. Decentralisation plans will be progressed in the coming months with a view to the Agency relocating to Cork in the course of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA)</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">In the case of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), a decision was made prior to its establishment that it would be located in Naas, Co Kildare.  Having been established in December, 2005 it moved to new offices at Naas,  in January 2006. All IAASA staff have been based in its offices in Naas since its establishment, and as such the Authority is fully decentralised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1264">The increase in unemployment in the construction sector, while unwelcome, must be seen in the context of the major increase in employment over the last number of years, an increase which was particularly strong in the construction sector.  The anticipated period of adjustment is now being experienced in new house building.  However, overall employment is forecast to continue to grow, albeit at a reduced rate than heretofore, thereby providing new job opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">The Government is giving priority to fully implementing the National Development Plan in order to boost the productive capacity of the economy.  Infrastructural spending under the Plan will help to absorb some of the excess capacity which is emerging from the new house building sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">The most recent FÁS/ESRI Employment and Vacancies Survey for December 2007 shows that the percentage of firms reporting vacancies across all sectors is 14%, which is in line with the average for the year.  The current rate for firms reporting vacancies in the construction sector is 8%, which is slightly below the 9% for the same period last year.  While it is true to say that construction employment is decreasing employment in the sector has not collapsed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">FÁS provides an integrated support service for anyone made redundant including those who might lose their jobs in the construction sector.

            <p eId="para_1297">The Employment Appeals Tribunal is an independent body under the aegis of the Department. As an independent body, I have no role in relation to the day-to-day operation of the Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">I understand that the Tribunal has been taking steps to reduce waiting times, including targeting areas of the country where the waiting time is longest. For example, as the longest waiting period with the highest numbers of cases on hand were in County Cork, the Tribunal increased its sittings from one to two divisions in November and December last year. As a result the number of cases awaiting hearing was reduced from 177 to 94 and consequently the waiting period was reduced from 61 weeks to 30 weeks. I understand the Tribunal will continue to target other areas of the country with particular regard to the volume of cases on hand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299">The Government undertook in the Social Partnership Agreement, "Towards 2016" to increase the staffing resources of the Tribunal.  The commitment is for an increase of 8 staff.  To date 5 extra staff have been deployed.  I expect that these extra staff will enable the Tribunal to substantially reduce the waiting time for a hearing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">The Tribunal Chairperson has drawn attention at meetings with the Department to the need for full staff resources. I am pleased to say that the Department will be in a position to assign the remaining 3 staff to the Tribunal in the near future, which will address the resources issue.</p>

         the negotiations he has had with the Department for Social and Family Affairs on new initiatives to encourage people off the live register, particularly the medium and long term unemployed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1302">As the Deputy will be aware, the main policy instrument to encourage people off the Live Register is the National Employment Action Plan Preventive Strategy.  The Preventive Strategy, which was first introduced in 1998 and rolled out nationwide in subsequent years involves a more systematic engagement with the unemployed.  On reaching a three month threshold on the Live Register, each individual aged between 18 and 64 years is referred by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to FÁS where they are called in for interview and assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">Specifically, in regard to the Deputy's question, it is not clear what new initiatives he is referring to.  I am assuming that it is the proposed Social and Economic Participation Programme which is being developed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  This programme, for which there is provision in the National Development Plan, is aimed at all people of working age regardless of the circumstances that led them to require income maintenance and not just those on the Live Register.  I understand that this programme will build on the existing experience in the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the relationship they have with the  people concerned and will include co-operation with other relevant service providers such as FÁS, VECs, HSE and other local agencies.  I also understand that the vision of the new programme is of a single transparent system with a primary focus on the customer and a route map starting at the first point of engagement by all clients of the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">I fully support this initiative insofar as it should assist progression towards gainful employment for many who might not otherwise come within the parameters of existing supports.  In particular I welcome the possibility of an initial intervention of this kind which should help in directing clients to the most appropriate support for their needs at an early stage.  My focus is to continue to attempt to get as many people as possible of working age involved in a process of education, training or whatever is required to progress towards employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">I can assure the Deputy that a high degree of co-operation already exists at both policy and operational level between my Department, FÁS and the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs.  Senior officials from my Department hold regular joint meetings with officials from the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs, with officials from FÁS also present as appropriate. Our Departments and FÁS work closely together to ensure that those on the live register receive help and guidance in accessing the range of training and employment supports provided by FÁS and this co-operation will continue in the context of the introduction of the Social and Economic Participation Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1309">The implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has resulted in the creation of opportunities for the attraction and development of foreign direct investment to the Border region.  I accept that there is a need for Government investment in areas such as Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan if we are to succeed in attracting inward investment and jobs and this is being delivered under the National Development Plan and National Spatial Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for IDA Ireland.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.  However, the Border and North West regions are a priority location for IDA and the Agency has been able to attract new investments in emerging sectors such as life sciences, ICT and high-value services activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">A ‘Comprehensive Study on the All-Island Economy', which was commissioned by the British-Irish InterGovernmental  Conference and prepared by senior officials from both Governments and InterTradeIreland, was completed in 2006.  This study identified a number of areas where co-ordinated North/South policy intervention would prove beneficial to both jurisdictions on this island. The areas identified included co-operation on trade and investment promotion, research and development and the development of the knowledge economy, education and training systems to enhance human capital, and co-ordinated provision of key transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructure. The National Development Plan 2007-2013 sets out a detailed and specific agenda for progressing such co-operation. Work is underway to progress these initiatives, which will also enhance economic development in the border counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">Development agencies, both North and South, are in agreement that the  development of the All Island Business Ecosystem Environment Framework presented a real and tangible structure upon which to build a common working agenda for the greater benefit in attracting Foreign Direct Investment to the Island.  This framework is focused on developing key areas of infrastructure and skill which will advance the promotion of Ireland as a location for enterprise development.  One example of existing cross border co-operation between IDA and Invest Northern Ireland is the development of the Virtual Cross border Technology Park between Derry and Donegal .</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">I am confident that as the ongoing co-operation between Governments on both sides of the border, together with the work of the agencies on the ground, will continue to bring improved economic development and investment to areas in the Border region.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1315">Under Article 40.6.1 of the Constitution, the State guarantees liberty for the exercise, subject to public order and morality, of, inter alia, "the right of citizens to form associations and unions".  It has been established in a number of legal cases that the constitutional guarantee of the freedom of association does not guarantee workers the right to have their union recognised for the purpose of collective bargaining.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature.  In line with this voluntarist approach, a High Level Group comprising representatives from IBEC, ICTU, and various Government Departments and agencies and chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach was established under Partnership 2000 to consider proposals submitted by ICTU on the recognition of unions and the right to bargain.  This Group recommended that two distinct procedures be put in place for the resolution of disputes where negotiation arrangements are not in place and collective bargaining does not exist — a voluntary procedure and a legislative fall back procedure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">These recommendations were implemented through the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2000 (Statutory Instrument No. 145 of 2000) and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001.  These measures were improved by the introduction of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2004 (S.I. No. 76 of 2004), the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Victimisation) (Declaration) Order 2004 (S.I.

            <p eId="para_1320">I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 58 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">The number of deaths recorded in workplace accidents during 2007 was 67 compared to 51 fatalities in 2006. Of these 18 were in construction in 2007, an increase of 5 on 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">In terms of injuries, there were over 7,000 non-fatal work injuries overall reported to the Authority in 2007. The most common non-fatal accident triggers for all sectors were handling, lifting and carrying (34%), and slips, trips and falls (18%). These triggers  have been repeatedly  the two most common every year since 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">Construction is one of the sectors which is repeatedly in the top three sectors which have the most accidents.  I have stated on a number of occasions that I am concerned at the increase in fatalities in the construction sector. The Health and Safety Authority shares this concern and continues to focus its inspection and awareness campaigns in this and other high-risk sectors as it has been doing.  Also it will continue to work with employer and employee organisations to make workplace safety, health and welfare an integral part of doing business in every workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1324">The Authority's programme of work for 2008 sets out its key priorities and activities and targets a 10% increase in the number of workplace inspections this year to 17,500. In relation to the construction sector the Authority will carry out 7,000 construction site inspections in 2008.  Also, the Authority will continue to implement the 2006 Construction Regulations and the Safe System of Work Plan (SSWP).</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">The Safe System of Work Plan is a system that was designed in Ireland and was first introduced in 2005 by the Health and Safety Authority, which is aimed at reducing injuries and deaths on construction sites. The initiative relies heavily on pictograms to explain and clarify hazards and controls, thereby creating a wordless document where safety can be communicated to all workers regardless of literacy or language skills. The Safe System of Work Plan aims to focus on those in the construction industry who are most at risk, allowing them to ensure that all necessary safety controls are in place prior to the commencement of planned work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">Together with the above, the Authority, in consultation with its stakeholders, is finalising a comprehensive Code of Practice for small employers in the construction sector, which is a further tool in advocating safe practice in the workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">In addition to this in 2008 the Authority will also develop, consult on and publish codes of practice on construction anchors, precast concrete and roofwork.</p>

It is generally accepted that the rate of growth experienced over the past few years could not continue and the economy is now entering a period of adjustment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">Employment has increased in most sectors when comparing data year on year (Q3, 2006 to Q3, 2007) and quarter on quarter (Q2 to Q3, 2007), as per the following table.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1414">Data from the CSO quarterly industrial survey shows that average industrial earnings per hour for male industrial workers on adult rates in June 2007 was €16.62. For female industrial workers the average rate was €12.73.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">From the CSO National Employment Survey for March 2006, average hourly earnings were €20.59 for males and €18.22 for females. These latter figures cover the entire economy in March 2006 (excluding employees in agriculture, forestry and fishing).</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">The gender pay gap has fallen consistently and is now below the EU average of 15%.  The most recent official figures from EUROSTAT  (2005) put the Irish gender pay gap at 9%, placing us fourth lowest among the EU27.  This compares with a rate of 14% in 2003, showing a drop of 5% in two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">Primary responsibility for policy in relation to the gender pay gap is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Addressing the factors behind the gender pay gap is, however, a multi faceted task involving a number of Government Departments and agencies as outlined in the National Women's Strategy, 2007-2016.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and is responsible for a number of actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1418">As Minister for Labour Affairs, I am responsible for the National Minimum Wage legislation.  The national minimum wage was introduced in Ireland in April 2000.  Since its introduction there have been six increases to the minimum rate.  The most recent increase saw the minimum wage increase to €8.65 per hour, which is the second highest in the EU. The introduction of the national minimum wage in 2000 has had a positive impact on women who previously were more likely to have received very low wages in sectors which were predominantly female.  Prior to the introduction of the minimum wage, the gender pay gap was at 22%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419">My Department is responsible for chairing and providing the secretariat for the National Framework Committee on Work/life Balance Policies. This Committee, which was established under the social partnership process, comprises representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Equality Authority and a number of Government Departments.  The Committee has undertaken and continues to undertake a range of activities to raise awareness and encourage the provision of work/life balance at the level of the enterprise and these can help to encourage greater female participation in the workforce, including at senior levels which in turn can help narrow the earnings gap.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">Similarly, "Expanding the Workforce", which is run by FÁS, is aimed at proactively encouraging women to return to work. The initiative facilitates women returnees by ensuring that training is provided in a flexible manner and is tailored to meet business requirements and skills needs of employers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1422">In its first 11 months of operation (February 2007 to end December 2007), a total of 2,974 permits issued under the Green Card Scheme. This figure represents close to one third of total new employment permits issued by the Department in 2007 and represents an increase over the 2,713 permits issued in 2006 under the Work Visa/Work Authorisation Scheme, which the Green Card Scheme replaced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">The Green Card Scheme was established to fill skills shortages, identified in consultation with the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, in strategically important areas of the economy.  A Green Card, as distinct from a Work Permit, therefore, is only available for highly qualified applicants in certain skilled occupations. The majority of such posts must offer an annual salary of at least €60,000. For a small number of occupations, posts with salaries between €30,000 and €60,000 qualify.</p>

            <p eId="para_1425">The National Consumer Agency, which was established on a statutory basis on the commencement of the Consumer Protection Act in May 2007, is empowered as part of its mandate to prepare and publish guidelines to traders in relation to matters of consumer welfare and protection and matters related to commercial practices.  The Act also entitles the Agency to review or approve Codes of Practice submitted to it by traders or their trade associations where the Agency is satisfied that the Code of Practice protects consumer interests and is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act or any other enactment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">In addition to publicly stating its desire to establish a strong relationship with business to develop a high standard of consumer protection and to promote voluntary compliance by business with consumer legislation, the Agency has held discussions with a number of business and representative bodies in relation to possible Codes of Practice.  Furthermore, the Agency is preparing Guidelines to business in two specific areas namely the Retail Sector and the Health and Fitness Sector.  Following initial consultations with both sectors, the Agency is in the process of preparing detailed documents which reflect the views provided by businesses in those sectors and their representative bodies. The Agency intends to further consult with the sectors concerned with a view to finalizing matters as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">I welcome the Agency's positive approach in working with traders and their representative associations to develop a strong consumer culture amongst Irish business.  There can be little doubt that the development and promotion of such a culture through initiatives such as Agency Guidelines and Consumer Codes of Practice will be to the benefit of not only consumers but also the businesses themselves and the economy as a whole.</p>

While the proposed EU Directive on Temporary Agency Work is not, at present, on the formal Agenda of the Council on 29th February, it may be raised informally by EU Ministers on the margins of the Council.  Ireland will continue to pursue its approach to the consideration and discussion of this dossier in a consistent and constructive fashion to find a solution to outstanding problems.  A key issue will be to ensure that any approach that may be agreed would not adversely impact on Ireland by putting us at a disadvantage to our continental counterparts in this area given different legal and industrial relations frameworks and traditions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1466">In the Commission's December 2007 Report on Ireland's implementation of its National Reform Programme under the Lisbon strategy, the Commission said, and I quote, that:  "Ireland has been making very good progress in implementing its National Reform Programme over the 2005-2007 period".  Once again, Ireland was amongst a small group of Member States which did not receive any specific recommendations.  It was also reported that progress was good over the full 2005-2007 period with regard to the implementation of particular policies to address micro-economic challenges, notably improving competitiveness, infrastructure, regulation and social inclusion, increasing R&amp;D investment and efficiency, encouraging greater innovation and entrepreneurship and sustainable development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">On 19th February, 2008, as part of the Stability and Growth Pact, the European Commission delivered an annual assessment of the Irish economy.  In its Report, the Commission recommended that Ireland should maintain firm control over public expenditures in order to keep the public finances in broad balance and implement further pension reforms to improve the long-term sustainability of the public finances in view of the significant projected increase in age-related expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">Our overall growth performance is still impressive by international standards and growth is expected to pick up in 2009 and 2010. This is very much in keeping with the Commission's assessment that our growth prospects remain good and well above the euro area and EU averages.  It is important to bear in mind, in relation to the Commission assessment, that the fundamentals of the Irish economy remain sound.  The Irish workforce is dynamic, well educated and responsive to changing circumstances.  Our markets for goods, services and labour are very flexible by international standards.  We have an effectively regulated, pro-enterprise society where hard work and entrepreneurship are rewarded.  The burden of taxation is low and is conducive to productivity growth and to attracting inward investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1470">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and assists them in enhancing/developing both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April, 2000). Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and people with disabilities may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1476">I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 65 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">The number of inspections undertaken by NERA inspectors to check compliance in 2007 amounted to 14,425.  Of these inspections no breaches were detected in 8,556 cases while breaches were detected in 2,353 cases. The number of inspections in 2006 amounted to 15,855.  Of these inspections, no breaches were detected in 10,113 cases while breaches were detected in 2,108 cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">The number of inspections undertaken by NERA inspectors to check compliance with National Minimum Wage legislation in 2007 amounted to 1,942.  Of these inspections no breaches were detected in 1,750 cases while breaches were detected in 192 cases. The number of inspections in 2006 amounted to 2,002.  Of these inspections, no breaches were detected in 1,898 cases while breaches were detected in 104 cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">Insofar as comparisons with 2006 and previous years are concerned, I am advised by the National Employment Rights Authority that there are three main reasons for the reduction in the number of inspections generally carried out in 2007: Firstly, NERA Inspection Services undertook a comprehensive and extensive employment rights compliance campaign in the construction sector during June and July of 2007.  The nature of the Construction Sector in terms of mobility, places of employment (headquarters and sites) and numbers of employees dictated a specific approach from NERA Inspection Services in order to optimise effectiveness.  This approach was resource intensive in terms of inspector numbers, planning, intelligence gathering and liaison with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in relation to joint investigations and the exchange of data.  This campaign necessarily resulted in the diversion of resources for a considerable period from inspection activity in sectors that would be less demanding in terms of inspection planning, liaison and duration.  However, the approach adopted for the Construction Campaign was extremely successful.  Some €1.3 million was secured by NERA Inspection Services for employees arising from breaches detected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">Secondly, recruitment processes and training plans had to be put in place for the recruitment of 59 new inspectors in line with the commitment given under Towards 2016, the Social Partnership Agreement.  Successful candidates were identified for the 59 additional posts and twenty new inspectors were assigned during 2007.  Again, this recruitment and training was resource intensive and the influx of the 20 new inspectors within such a short timeframe required a strong commitment from existing inspectors in terms of training, mentoring and other supports and diverted resources from inspection activity during that period.  Thirdly, there has been a substantial training investment in existing inspectors.  This investment will continue in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">Notwithstanding the reduction in the number of employment rights inspections/visits compared to the same period in 2006, it should be noted that the outcomes in a number of respects are extremely positive.  Firstly, over €2.5 million in arrears due to employees was recovered by NERA Inspection Services in 2007 compared to €1.4 million for 2006.  Secondly, 2,353 breaches were detected by Inspection Services in 2007 compared to 2,108 for 2006.  Thirdly, 28 prosecutions were initiated by Inspection Services in 2007 compared to 8 for 2006.  These outcomes point to the value of the more focussed and targeted activities being undertaken by NERA in relation to employment rights promotion and compliance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1483">Since 1997, over 500,000 new jobs were created in Ireland and the number in employment now exceeds 2 million.  There was a net gain of 1,115 jobs in agency assisted full time jobs in 2007, including Udaras Na Gaeltachta, with a further 2,200 net jobs created by the CEBs.  Looking to the future, two of the Government's main tasks are to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain.  Therefore we continue to enhance our framework competitive conditions, promote new areas of competitive advantage by developing our R&amp;D base, invest in critical physical and communications infrastructures and promote tertiary education and lifelong learning, in line with the NDP and the Programme for Government.  Over the period of the new National Development Plan the Government will provide €3.3bn investment specifically to support the development of the enterprise base in addition to NDP investment in infrastructure and skills.  Critical to the delivery of that investment are the activities of the enterprise development agencies of my Department, namely Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Shannon Development and the County Enterprise Boards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">Enterprise Ireland (EI) recently launched their new strategy, ‘Transforming Irish Industry 2008-2010'.  This builds on the strong progress made in the past three years and focuses on driving growth and internationalisation, increasing Irish innovation, growing companies of scale, gaining growth and competitiveness in existing and emerging sectors and driving growth in services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">EI works with approximately 3500 Irish-owned companies who employ over 150,000 people and spent approximately €17bn in the domestic economy in 2006.  Success in their new strategy will ensure that EI continues to stimulate growth in Irish enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">Shannon Development works with 110 companies, employing over 7,000, at the Shannon Free Zone.  The company has continuous engagement with this client base, encouraging expansion activity and the creation of new opportunities for economic growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">In 2007 a total of 945 projects were approved for direct financial assistance from the County Enterprise Boards while a total of 927 projects received grant aid.  In 2008 the Capital allocation for the 35 CEBs stands at over €20m.  This investment is augmented by the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">Based on a healthy pipeline of prospective new projects, IDA is confident that Ireland is well placed to secure significant investment going forward from key target sectors such as Pharmaceuticals, Biopharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, International Services, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Financial Services and Digital Media.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">Proof of our national evolution as a significant 21st century knowledge economy is evidenced in the sophistication and complexity of the investments secured from leading corporations into Ireland.  Investments such as Microsoft's €360m EMEA Data Centre in Dublin and the new pharmaceutical development centre by Wyeth Medica in Newbridge bear testament to this fact.  I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies under the remit of my department will continue to bear fruit throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1491">I am assuming that the Deputy's question refers to the reduction in ‘administrative burdens' — or so-called ‘red tape' — on business.  In March 2007, the European Council agreed that "administrative burdens arising from EU legislation should be reduced by 25% by 2012.  Taking into account the different starting points and traditions, the European Council invites Member States to set their own national targets of comparable ambition within their spheres of competence by 2008."</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">Prior to that Spring European Council, the Government agreed that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should lead the cross-Departmental and agency drive, and put in place a mechanism under the Secretary General of his Department, to drive this agenda at national level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">As part of this effort, I established the High-level Group on Business Regulation, under the chairmanship of the Secretary General of my Department.  The High-level Group comprises representatives of Government Departments and Agencies, the business sector and a representative of ICTU.  In its work to date, the Group has been examining concrete measures to reduce the administrative burdens in five policy areas — Taxation, Statistics, Environment, Health and Safety and Employment &amp; Company Law — which are considered to impose the highest burdens on business.  I expect the High Level Group to submit its initial report to me by July, 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">Before setting a definitive national target in response to the European Council invitation, I am at present consulting with my Government colleagues on what processes might be needed to assess the extent of administrative burdens on Irish business and on the measures that have been undertaken or are planned to reduce that burden.</p>

         his views on reports of recent substantial increases in the price of a range of food prices and forecasts that food prices will rise further by the end of 2008; if he is satisfied that sufficient protection is available to protect consumers against unwarranted price increases; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [8337/08]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_599">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1496">The January 2007 Consumer Price Index as published by the Central Statistics Office shows that although the annual rate of inflation fell to 4.3% in January down from 4.7% in December, the price of food and non alcoholic beverages increased 6.7% in the past 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1497">It is an undisputed fact that rising food prices are being experienced right across the world.  These increases have been precipitated by a number of different factors including climatic, economic and demand reasons.  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation have identified that the rapid expansion of the global bio fuel industry is causing fundamental changes to agricultural markets and is likely to keep the prices of agricultural commodities high over the next decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1498">The loss of significant tracts of potential food-producing land has pushed up the cost of the animal feed used by dairy farmers.  This has also coincided with surging demand for meat and dairy produce in India and China, as their economies and diets become more westernised.  Nearer to home, persistent rain in Ireland last Summer had a significant effect on crops such as cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli with up to 50% of some growers' yields being severely affected.  Grain prices in Ireland continue to rise with the realisation that wheat harvests in most regions did not deliver as expected which in turn has increased the price of barley.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">In terms of food prices into the future, it is likely that the demand, economic and climatic reasons which underlie the recent price increases may continue to be experienced for some time.  Notwithstanding the pressure that these factors will continue to bear on food prices, a number of commentators have suggested that in the short-term at least, higher prices are likely, other things being equal, to lead to some increase in food production and a consequent moderation in prices.  Maize prices, for example, have fallen since the spring of 2007 in response to increased plantings, though they remain well above 2006 levels.  The EU has removed the mandatory set-aside quota for cereal sowings in autumn 2007 and spring 2008 and this is expected to boost production by around 10 million tonnes.  Teagasc have forecast that cereal prices will fall by around 20 per cent in 2008, though they will still be 40-50 per cent higher than in 2006.  They have also forecast that wholesale milk prices may decline by around 7 per cent in 2008, though again remaining significantly in excess of those in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">Notwithstanding the global rise in food prices, national policy in so far as the price of food to Irish consumers is concerned, is focused on promoting a competitive grocery market and raising consumer awareness in relation to the need to get the best value for money when doing their grocery shopping.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">Whilst clearly the recent increases in the price of a variety of staple foods is a matter of concern, I am confident that the measures in place to allow consumers to make informed choices about the grocery items that they buy together with the work of bodies such as the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency will help to ensure that consumers do not suffer from unwarranted price increases when doing their grocery shopping.</p>

            <p eId="para_1505">There is no provision in Irish consumer law which prevents retailers from recording the price of goods in different currencies.  The European Communities (Requirement to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002, do, however, oblige retailers to indicate the price in euro on all goods offered for sale. Additionally the Consumer Protection Act 2007 makes it illegal to mislead consumers in relation to the price of a product.  The Regulations and the Act are enforced by the National Consumer Agency and any infringements of these provisions should be reported to the Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">The European Commission is currently conducting a review of the Consumer Acquis which will involve a comprehensive examination of a total of eight specific consumer protection Directives, including the Directive which gave rise to the Requirement to Indicate Product Price Regulations.  Whilst it is not possible at this stage to state precisely when the Commission's examination of this Directive will be completed, I am anxious that the discussions at European level should continue to focus on the need for clear indication of price information to consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">I fully accept the importance of consumers being given the necessary price information in order to be able to make informed decisions in relation to the goods that they buy.

            <p eId="para_1511">The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature.  In line with this voluntarist approach, a High Level Group comprising representatives from IBEC, ICTU, and various Government Departments and agencies and chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach was established under Partnership 2000 to consider proposals submitted by ICTU on the recognition of unions and the right to bargain.  This Group recommended that two distinct procedures be put in place for the resolution of disputes where negotiation arrangements are not in place and collective bargaining does not exist — a voluntary procedure and a legislative fall back procedure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">These recommendations were implemented through the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2000 (Statutory Instrument No. 145 of 2000) and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001.  These measures were improved by the introduction of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2004 (S.I. No. 76 of 2004), the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Victimisation) (Declaration) Order 2004 (S.I.

            <p eId="para_1513">The Constitution explicitly protects the rights of an individual to join or not to join a trade union.  While it is, in fact, unclear as to whether the Oireachtas is prevented from requiring employers to recognise trade unions, I have no plans to introduce measures that would seek to oblige employers to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">At the social partnership plenary session of Friday 15 February, the Taoiseach invited the social partners to participate in a formal review of "Towards 2016", to prepare their assessments of the progress made to date and the issues that arise from that assessment.  Some social partners have already indicated that the adequacy of the measures I have referred to is an issue that may be raised in the partnership discussions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1553">Competition law policy is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the first instance.  However it is clear that the section of the Act cited by the Deputy confers a power on the Competition Authority, not on a Minister of the Government, to make a declaration in the terms described.  I understand that the Competition Authority has not made a declaration under the Act such that the negotiation of contracts for service and associated fees with bodies representing self-employed health professionals would be exempted from the provisions of the Competition Act 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">As I announced on 18 February 2008, I am establishing an Independent Body to begin work immediately to assess an interim, fair community pharmacy dispensing fee of at least €5 to be paid for the medical card scheme, the Drugs Payment Scheme and other community drug schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">This Body is being chaired by Seán Dorgan, former Head of IDA Ireland. It will take submissions from all sides and will carry out its own analysis. Its recommended fee level, subject to Government approval, will be backdated to 1 March 2008. The development of the substantive new contract will get under way immediately and will be completed as soon as possible; this will be done under the auspices of an agreed facilitator and it too will be priced by the Independent Body.</p>
            <p eId="para_1556">The Independent Body held its first meeting on 25th February 2008 and the requested date for submission of the Body's report is 31 May 2008. Both the HSE as the contracting body and the IPU as the representative organisation for community pharmacists, along with other stakeholders, will be entitled to make submissions to the Independent Body addressing whatever factors and issues are of concern to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">The Independent Body will also be entitled to engage whatever outside expertise it requires to assist it with its task.  Based on its consideration of submissions received and its own independent evaluation, the body will recommend an appropriate dispensing fee that would, in its view, represent a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the pharmaceutical service currently being provided by community pharmacists to the HSE under the GMS and community drug schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">In addition to the foregoing my Department is at present working, in consultation with relevant Government Departments and with the HSE, to devise appropriate new arrangements for the development and the pricing of contracts for the provision of health services generally, including the GMS general practitioner contract.  It is my wish that, once these arrangements have been finalised, the development of a new GMS GP contract should be progressed as a matter of urgency by the HSE with a view to putting in place contractual arrangements which will facilitate the delivery of general practitioner services as a key and integral component of a modern primary care service.</p>

        <b>Deputy Pádraic McCormack</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
         if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the proposed changes in the community childcare funding will have a serious adverse effect on some childcare facilities as a result of the introduction of the childcare subvention scheme in July 2008; and the steps she will take to grant aid childcare facilities that will be seriously disadvantaged by the new regulations.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1564">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) which, together with the earlier Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), are implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over €500m in 2008.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) was introduced from 1st January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated €154.2 million over the next 3 years, representing a substantial increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme (which cost €37 million in 2007), and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which is to be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage, and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.  In addition, transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">When I announced the new scheme in July of last year, I signalled my intention to undertake a review of the Scheme on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which were to be forwarded to my Office in November and December 2007 as part of the application process of the new scheme.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the review was completed last December and the following adjustments to the scheme have been approved by the Government:</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">the childcare subvention rates, which form the basis for assessing the level of grant funding payable to community childcare services, have been increased from €80 to €100 per week in the case of Band A parents and from €30 to €70 per week in the case of Band B parents;</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">services will also be grant aided to enable them to provide reduced childcare fees for parents in Band C who are marginally above the Family Income Supplement (FIS) threshold and low income parents who qualify under this measure will benefit by €45 per week per full-time place;</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">where a parent moves to a lower Band (e.g. from social welfare into employment), the subvention paid in respect of them will be withdrawn on a tapered basis with the effect that where a parent would no longer qualify for a Band A payment, he or she will be treated as a Band B parent in the following year;</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">special provisions will be provided for in the case of childcare services where, for valid reasons, it is not possible to assess grant funding on the basis of annual parental declarations alone (e.g. women's refuges, special services for children of drug misusers) and, in exceptional cases, where special levels of funding provision may be required;</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">in recognition of the on-going input of the community and voluntary sector, and to provide stability for services which would otherwise receive very low levels of grant subvention (e.g. small rural services) a minimum annual grant level of €20,000 is being introduced;</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">as a transitional measure during 2008-2010, services which could otherwise face a significant decrease in their existing level of grant support from July 2008, will continue to receive grant aid equal to not less than 90% of their previous grant level during July-December 2008, equal to not less than 85% of that amount in 2009, and equal to not less than 75% of that amount in 2010.  The transitional grant funding is conditional on all requirements of the Scheme being complied with, including the return of annual applications together with completed parent declaration forms and the implementation of tiered fees based on the subvention levels for Band A, B and C parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">Indeed, many applicants will receive higher levels of grant assistance under the new Scheme than was previously the case under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme staffing scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">I am confident that the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme is a fair and equitable way of supporting community childcare operators in the provision of an affordable and high quality service to parents, based on their means.</p>

            <p eId="para_1579">The Government is committed to the provision of high quality gynaecological services throughout the country, including the Cork region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">The Health Service Executive has advised my Department that the gynaecology service in Cork University Hospital currently includes five gynaecology theatre sessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">There were approximately 1,152 elective gynaecology procedures carried out in 2007.  In addition, there are approximately 17 emergency procedures carried out each month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">There are 3 operating theatres in Cork University Maternity Hospital — one obstetric and two gynaecological theatres.  The obstetric theatre is fully staffed and the hospital is currently recruiting senior nursing staff to open and lead the gynaecology theatre service.  In the interim, the gynaecology procedures continue to be carried out in the main theatres in Cork University Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">The HSE advises that preparations are under way for the phased opening of the gynaecology theatres in the Maternity Hospital.  It is planned that some minor surgical procedures will be carried out there on a trial basis on 27th March with the aim of expanding the gynaecology service from the first week in April.  The ultimate aim is to have the gynaecology theatre open on a five days per week basis.</p>

         if she will present a further report on the developing situation between the Health Service Executive and the Irish Pharmacist Union; if special arrangements are being put in place in respect of the 1 March 2008 deadline to ensure that patients are not disadvantaged; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1585">The Government is firm in its view that the wholesale mark-up paid on the price of drugs should be reduced to a level that is fair to both taxpayers and wholesalers.  The existing mark-up in the range of 15-17.6% is neither reasonable nor sustainable.  The decision to pay an 8% mark-up from 1 March, and 7% from 1 January 2009, will go ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">However, I am concerned, in particular, to support pharmacies which have a high proportion of medical card patients and where a dispensing fee of €3.27 applies for most transactions.  Many of these pharmacies are in rural or inner city areas and provide an important social and health service.  With my support, the HSE has indicated it is prepared to offer a higher fee, of no less than €5 per item dispensed, to community pharmacists, on the basis of an interim contract which would be essentially the same as the existing contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">I met with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union recently and heard their point that there should be an independent assessment of the fees offered.  I have now established an Independent Body to begin work immediately to assess an interim, fair community pharmacy dispensing fee of at least €5 to be paid for the medical card scheme, the Drugs Payment Scheme and other community drug schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">This body is being chaired by Seán Dorgan, former Head of IDA Ireland. It will take submissions from all sides and will carry out its own analysis. It has been asked to make its recommendations by the end of May 2008.  Its recommended fee level, subject to Government approval, will be backdated to 1 March 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">The terms of reference of the Independent Body are to advise the Minister for Health and Children on the appropriate level of dispensing fee to be paid to community pharmacists for existing services provided under the GMS and community drug schemes having regard to: the overall public interest including the issues of patient safety and continuity of supply; the fee of €5 per item which has already been offered; the reasonable costs incurred by pharmacists in providing services under the schemes and the value of the professional service of dispensing; the statutory obligation on the HSE to use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public; and to submit a report on the matter to the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">The requested date for submission of the Body's report is 31 May 2008.  The Independent Body held its first meeting on 25 February 2008 and is about to invite submissions.  Both the HSE as the contracting body and the IPU as the representative organisation for community pharmacists, along with other stakeholders, will be entitled to make submissions to the Independent Body addressing whatever factors and issues are of concern to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">The Independent Body will also be entitled to engage whatever outside expertise it requires to assist it with its task.  Based on its consideration of submissions received and its own independent evaluation, the body will recommend an appropriate dispensing fee that would, in its view, represent a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the pharmaceutical service currently being provided by community pharmacists to the HSE under the GMS and community drug schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">Each pharmacist will have three options: to avail of the interim contract as outlined by the HSE letter of 2 January 2008 immediately; to accept the interim contract upon the report of the Independent Body; or to stay with the existing retail fee structure until the agreement of a substantive new contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_1593">I believe this provides all concerned with a reasonable way to make the transition to a fair and transparent method of payment for present services and, I hope, greatly developed pharmacy services in the near future.  The HSE has contingency plans in place in the event of the withdrawal of service by community pharmacists including information notices in the newspapers and an information helpline, open from 8 am to 8 pm Monday to Friday.  In response to a request to all 1600 community pharmacy contractors from the HSE, two community pharmacists have confirmed their intention to withdraw services under the present pharmacy contract.  There are no changes planned to the GMS and community drugs schemes and all patients continue to receive their entitlements in the usual way.</p>

            <p eId="para_1595">The Northern Ireland Health Committee is currently undertaking an inquiry into the prevention of suicide and self harm in Northern Ireland. As part of that inquiry I met with the Committee on 21 February.

            <p eId="para_1596">During the meeting it was acknowledged that significant  cooperation exists on suicide prevention.  Implementation of the All Island Action Plan for Suicide Prevention is on-going and substantial progress has been made on a number of action areas including; joint launch of an awareness campaign in October 2007 (North and South), launch of the Deliberate Self Harm Registry on an all island basis and joint sponsorship of the successful International Association of Suicide Prevention Conference in Killarney in August 2007; training in Safe Talk, an intervention programme (a shortened version of ASIST Training (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) has taken place North and South and the development of media guidelines.</p>

            <p eId="para_1600">The report referred to by the Deputy, which relates to care services for older people in a locality of north Dublin, will be officially launched by me early next week.  The report makes various recommendations in relation to providing an enhanced range of services for the area in the future.  As the Deputy is aware, overall Government policy is to support older people in their homes and in their communities; to promote high standards for residential care; and to ensure that the cost of  quality care  for this sector is affordable to older persons and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">I would obviously have no objection in principle to supporting improved services for this particular catchment area, or indeed elsewhere around the country, provided that this is achieved in line with overall service priorities and resources generally.  As the Deputy is aware, operational responsibility for the development of health and personal social services, including those relating to services for older people in this specific area of Dublin, is in the first instance a matter for  the Health Service Executive.  Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider in detail the particular report raised by the Deputy.

            <p eId="para_1627">"Reach Out", a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, 2005-2014 provides a policy framework for suicide prevention activities in Ireland.   The strategy calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies. The HSE, through the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP), oversees the implementation of the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">Additional funding of €1.85 million was provided in 2007 for the implementation of the Strategy bringing the overall funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives in 2007 to €8 million and this level of funding continues into 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">A wide range of other expenditure on mental health services generally is of importance in measures to help prevent suicide.   A total of some €1 billion is now spent on mental health services, including consultant psychiatry and psychiatric nursing.   These services and other services such as Primary Care play a vital role in the drive to reduce the incidence of suicide, and should be taken into account when examining the level of total public expenditure devoted to suicide prevention.</p>

            <p eId="para_1637">This first review is an important step in moving forward the targets set in the Sectoral Plan.  It represents an important opportunity to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities are considered in all health policy planning and service delivery.

I very much regret that the ceasefire agreement concluded between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) in February 2002 has been terminated.  This can have only negative repercussions for Sri Lanka and its people, including for the already serious humanitarian and human rights situation in that country.  Both the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka must recognise that a sustainable solution to the problems Sri Lanka faces cannot be achieved by military means and that they need to immediately resume meaningful negotiations for a peaceful future for the people of Sri Lanka.</p>

            <p eId="para_1671">During the visit I met with a representative of the Saudi Red Crescent Society.  The Society is upgrading its fleet of approximately 700 ambulances and is looking at a range of specialised equipment and software systems to enhance the level of modern pre-hospital emergency care delivered by ambulance services, through the electronic transmission of patient data from an ambulance to a designated hospital.  Consequently I invited Prince Faisal, who is President of the Saudi Red Crescent Society, to Ireland, to provide him with an opportunity to explore what Irish industry has to offer the Society in this highly specialised area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">A number of ambulances in the HSE's North Eastern Region operate the particular specialised equipment and software system that allows for the electronic transfer of patient data from those ambulances to Our Lady of Lourdes hospital in Drogheda.  The Prince viewed the operation of this system at the hospital on 20th February.  I am hopeful that this visit will lead to increased trade opportunities for Irish companies operating in this particular sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1705">On 15 April 2004, the person to whom the Deputy has referred  received his statutory redundancy entitlement payment of €26,918.70.

            <p eId="para_1708">There are several mechanisms that my Department has established to ensure that emerging competitiveness issues are addressed expeditiously and responded to promptly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">In July 2005, I asked the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs to identify the skills required for Ireland to become a competitive, innovative, knowledge based, inclusive economy by 2020. In response the Expert Group undertook a detailed programme of research and a wide consultation process, the results of which led to the National Skills Strategy.  The publication of the National Skills Strategy in 2007 has set an ambitious vision for the skills profile in Ireland in 2020.  This Strategy sets out clear long-term objectives in developing our human capital through upskilling, training and education for the period to 2020.  The Strategy was prepared on the basis of a cross-Departmental and whole of Government approach to the issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">Science and Technology is a key driver in this Department's policy agenda for competitiveness and growth. The Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation 2006 — 2013 was launched in June 2006.   Over the lifetime of the NDP, the State will invest  €6.1 billion in Science &amp; Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">Enterprise support policies have consistently evolved over the years to meet the needs of both foreign direct investment and growth orientated indigenous firms.  Enterprise Ireland recently published its Strategy for 2008-2010 following on from its 2005-2007 Strategy which was directed at transforming Irish industry.  IDA has for many years followed a strategy of active engagement with our companies to move more of their strategic and higher value activities to Ireland, thus capitalising on the key advantages which Ireland has to offer today. We continue to be very successful with this strategy as is evidenced by the on going flow of high quality projects won for Ireland.  With regard to labour force development, FÁS liaises with other relevant agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the City/County Enterprise Boards to assist people in progressing towards employment, training or active labour market programmes.  FÁS also works closely with the agencies to identify and support individuals who wish to start their own business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">One of the strengths of the Irish business environment over the last decade has been the light administrative and regulatory requirements faced by firms, particularly compared with other EU countries.  One of the commitments in the Government's White Paper "Regulating Better" in January 2004 was to keep the State's regulatory institutions and framework under review.  The subsequent report on the Introduction of Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) outlines the steps necessary for developing full regulatory impact assessments while the Business Forum on Regulation which is chaired by my Department is working to identify disproportionate administrative burdens that may impede competitiveness This Forum provides a mechanism for increased dialogue on regulation between policy makers and business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">The role of the Department's regulatory agencies such as the Competition Authority, National Consumer Agency, ODCE and NERA all play an important role in enhancing the regulatory environment for business and consumers thereby contributing to competitiveness. Furthermore, the Department is actively implementing the measures recommended in the report of the Small Business Forum 2006.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1715">There are a variety of differing and complex factors and not just cost, which might influence a decision to relocate all or part of a firm's functions. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the number of jobs which have relocated to low cost economies. In addition to relative wage rates and other cost factors, these may include business takeovers, consolidations and changes in product or market focus. The offshoring of lower value-added functions is, however, part of the reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">While off-shoring can contribute to job losses for firms in some sectors, productivity gains achieved through off-shoring some activities also represents an opportunity to develop higher-end manufacturing and related activities domestically. Where job losses have occurred, these have for the most part been in low cost manufacturing. Other sectors, especially the services sector, are providing significant new employment opportunities. Since 1997, over half a million new jobs were created in Ireland and the numbers in employment now exceeds 2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">Ireland is no longer a low cost economy and manufacturers in particular are facing increased competition from producers in lower cost economies. The model of manufacturing in developed countries is changing and Irish enterprises are adapting to those changes and engaging in higher value added activities in order to compete in the global marketplace. This has been achieved as a result of increased productivity, technology levels and sophisticated skills of Irish employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">One of the Government's main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business, and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain. In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and promote new areas of competitive advantage by developing our R&amp;D base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures, and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning and up-skilling to improve labour market flexibility, in line with the NDP and the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability, that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy, and are consequently less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences.</p>

            <p eId="para_1724">Forecasting employment figures is a perilous business and subject to a variety of unforseen extraneous variables influencing estimates of that nature. However, employment growth — being the excess of jobs created over jobs lost — is expected to continue to be positive in 2008, though growing at a slower pace than in previous years. In the Budget Outlook employment is forecast to grow by over 1% in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">The Irish economy is undergoing a certain amount of adjustment and while the rate of employment growth is expected to slow it must be viewed in the context of historically unprecedented numbers of people in work. Since 1997, over half a million new jobs were created in Ireland and the number in employment now exceeds two million. Ireland is no longer a low cost economy however, and manufacturers in particular are facing increased competition from producers in lower cost economies. The model of manufacturing in developed countries is changing and Irish enterprises are adapting to those changes and engaging in higher value added activities in order to compete in the global marketplace. The services sector continues to provide significant new employment opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">Competition for foreign direct investment (FDI) continues to be relentless but Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.  While costs are higher, we have responded by positioning ourselves as a location for more advanced activities, with more qualified and better paying jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">Looking to the future, neither the Government nor my Department are complacent regarding the varied challenges facing the country's economy. One of our main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business, and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain. In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and promote new areas of competitive advantage by developing our R&amp;D base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures, and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning, in line with the NDP and the Programme for Government. Over the period of the new National Development Plan the Government will provide €3.3bn investment specifically to support the development of the indigenous and FDI enterprise base, in addition to NDP investment in infrastructure and skills.</p>

            <p eId="para_1729">The National Competitiveness Council's Annual Competitiveness Report 2007 has identified three areas essential to improving our competitiveness position: costs, productivity growth and promoting an innovation intensive economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">I agree with the NCC that, as part of our economic policy, seeking to maintain low inflation, promoting competition, the pursuit of sensible incomes policy, and keeping public spending growth at sustainable levels in the medium term are important. Doing this will allow us to keep the burden of taxation low, thus helping to maintain competitiveness and to maximise our economic potential. These are all part of our strategy to improve the cost environment and to enhance competitiveness.  The Anti-Inflation Group which was reconstituted under Towards 2016 has actively engaged with the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) with a view to co-ordinating and driving the fight against inflation on an informed basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">There are several ways in which my Department is actively trying to improve productivity growth. I announced the establishment of the Management Development Council in May 2007. The Council brings together the key providers and users of SME management development training in Ireland. The Council has been charged with examining existing management development provision, while profiling gaps and proposing solutions to address them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">The enterprise Agencies are actively promoting more effective use of ICT among their client companies, also in an effort to improve productivity. Productivity improvements at firm level are vital to export competitiveness but the onus is on firms to work with our agencies to access the expertise available to improve their export capabilities.  Enterprise Ireland's Productivity Improvement Fund provides support for capital equipment and automation as well as technology acquisition and the essential training and skills to optimise the use of new technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">The Government has set a goal to become a leader in Research &amp; Development and Innovation and has committed a budget of €8.2 billion under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI) 2006-2013 towards achieving this goal. The objective of the Strategy is to build stronger relationships between the science and enterprise systems, particularly in application and commercialisation of R&amp;D. It also aims to ensure the sustained development of human resources in science and technology. Our goal is to translate the NDP commitment in this area into a tangible return in terms of quality jobs, knowledge output and Irish competitiveness.</p>

            <p eId="para_1736">The following tables set out the number of full time job gains and losses in enterprise agency assisted firms in Co. Kildare for each of the years between 2001 and 2007. Overall in the period in question 6433 new full-time jobs were created while job losses amounted to 6313. Additionally, in 2007 Kildare County Enterprise Board assisted in the creation of 147 net jobs in the county. From 2001 to 2007 the Board has assisted in the creation of 386 jobs throughout the County.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">The enterprise development agencies are committed to promoting Kildare as a location for investment as part of an integrated East Region, with access to a population base of 1.5 million people, as well as supporting and developing businesses already present in the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">Kildare has in recent years attracted some world class manufacturing companies such as Intel, Braun Oral-B and Hewlett Packard. These companies continue to invest in the area, as evidenced by Hewlett-Packard Financial Services proposed expansion of their EMEA headquarters in Leixlip and Intel's plans to establish the Technology Research for Independent Living (TRIL) Centre in Ireland. Approximately $30 million will be invested in the TRIL Centre over a period of three years and Intel will collaborate with several leading Irish universities, including UCD, TCD and NUI Galway to create one of the largest research efforts of this type in the world. IDA Ireland is also working to attract the International Services, Software, Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies who are setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies. Since the beginning of 2003, EI has approved over €12m in support to companies in Kildare to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development in order that they can compete on world markets. The consumer foods sector in particular, has shown rapid growth in recent years.  Over the last two years we have seen significant investment by Green Isle Foods and Dawn Farm Foods Ltd, both supported by Enterprise Ireland, leading to significant employment increases in both of these state of the art facilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1768">The Government is fully aware of the need to ensure that the skills of the labour force are adequate to meet the future requirements of the economy. That is why we established the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs in 1997 to provide advice to the Government on Ireland's future skills requirements and make recommendations as to how those needs could be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">The work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs has been central to forecasting Ireland's future skills requirements and identifying the appropriate strategies to meet them. The subsequent implementation of positive recommendations made by the Expert Group has significantly contributed to economic growth and job creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">Last year, the National Skills Strategy report was launched. This report is based on comprehensive research undertaken at my request by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.  It depicts an ambitious vision for the skills profile of Ireland in 2020 and sets out the advances necessary to realise it. The achievement of that vision should enable Ireland to develop a competitive advantage in the area of skills and ensure that we meet the evolving skills needs across the range of economic sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">The principle recommendation is on the need to upskill by 2020 an additional 500,000 people by at least one level on the National Framework of Qualifications. We will shortly establish an Inter-Departmental Committee that will be chaired by the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Minister Sean Haughey, T.D.  This Committee will approve an implementation plan for the National Skills Strategy and oversee its activation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">In the interim we have continued with our investment in the continued development of Ireland's human capital. This year alone my Department will invest €77 million in training those in employment. The objective is to reach about 86,000 people.  In total and in accordance with commitments contained in Towards 2016 and in the National Development Plan, we will invest approximately €7.7 billion in this vital area over the period 2007-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">The Government remains fully committed to providing enhanced education and training opportunities to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, all citizens have the necessary qualifications and skills to allow them both to lead successful and productive personal and vocational lives, on the one hand, and find enriching work in a national labour market that is characterised by quality jobs, high levels of productivity and competitive advantage vis-à-vis our trading partners.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1775">Over the last number of years there has been a significant churn in employment as is typical of a developed, open, and dynamic economy such as Ireland's. Ireland is no longer a low cost economy and manufacturers in particular are facing increased competition from producers in lower cost economies. Other sectors, especially the services sector, are providing significant new employment opportunities. Since 1997, over half a million new jobs were created in Ireland and the number in employment now exceeds 2.1 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">Despite the manufacturing sector in Ireland experiencing a decline in employment in line with most developed OECD economies, it has achieved very significant increases in output, reflecting growing productivity in the sector. Nonetheless the Government  is aware of the importance of the manufacturing sector to the Irish economy and the need to address the challenges it faces, if it is to continue to play a major role in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">The following Table lists the number of Enterprise Agency assisted (Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta) full-time jobs lost and gained per sector in 2007. 13,925 full-time manufacturing jobs were created in enterprise agency-assisted firms, however these gains were offset by losses of 16,855. In the services sector 11,430 jobs were created, while 7,385 jobs were lost; giving a net gain in service sector jobs of 4,045. Overall there was a net gain of 1,115 in enterprise agency-assisted jobs. In addition the County Education Boards created 2,200 net new jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">As part of the commitments included under the partnership agreement ‘Towards 2016', I established a high-level group in manufacturing, to review the challenges facing the manufacturing sector and to identify further measures to meet those challenges. This Group, comprised of Industry, Employee, Government and Enterprise Agency representatives, is currently in the process of finalising a report outlining their views and recommendations to ensure that manufacturing continues to play a major role in our economy and will report back to Partnership shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">To compliment the work ongoing in the High Level Group on Manufacturing, Forfás have established a group to look at the challenges and opportunities faced by the services sector. From this group we hope to prepare and position Irish enterprise to adapt to the globalisation of services with the aim of achieving sustainable and competitive services enterprise in Ireland based on three strategic imperatives:</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">Increasing Ireland's services export base;</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">Growing a cadre of Irish services companies that can expand into international markets (Overseas Direct Investment); and</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">Developing productive and competitive locally traded services including their globalisation potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">A report outlining how to maximise the future returns to Ireland from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential, is due to be completed in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1814">Motor insurance is provided in an open and competitive market where consumers can exert their influence.  The cost of Motor Insurance, generally, has declined by 11% in the twelve months to December 2007.  Motor insurance prices have dropped by 40% since April 2003 and at the end of Q3 2007 were at levels last seen in November 1997.  This is due to various reasons such as increased competitiveness in the Irish market, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and increased Garda enforcement including alcohol testing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">There are no comparative figures to assess motor insurance competitiveness across the EU.  The nature of such insurance varies from State to State.  In most of Europe, with the exception of Ireland and the UK, motor insurance is based on the vehicle rather than on the driver.  Other factors which influence costs include size of market, medical costs and social supports which are available to injured persons together with repair of vehicle costs.  Under the Social Partnership Agreement "Towards 2016" the Government gave a commitment to review the cost of motor insurance for young drivers.  The Department of Transport appointed external consultants in September 2007 to examine this matter.  The report is expected shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">Supervision of insurance undertakings is the responsibility of the Financial Regulator (formerly known as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority).  The Financial Regulator has a wide regulatory remit covering consumer protection and prudential supervision of practically all of the financial services industry, including insurance, and the services provided by it.  The Financial Regulator comes under the aegis of my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance.</p>

CE aims to facilitate unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.

            <p eId="para_1830">I hope to shortly be in a position to commence the process of selecting the Local Action Groups to deliver the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2007-2013.  The funding available for the delivery of LEADER-type activities under the Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2007–13 will amount to €425.4 million — almost treble the €150 million available for the 2000–06 period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1831">The Deputy will be aware that my Department has over the past number of years been pursuing a process of cohesion of local delivery structures in order to simplify and enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of a range of local development programmes.  Following extensive consultations with and between the local agencies to develop the most suitable configurations of groups, in the course of 2007, the Government decided on revised areas of coverage for local development groups and clarified the arrangements in relation to the membership of the boards of these bodies.  LEADER and Partnership groups have been asked to give effect to these decisions and my Department has provided detailed guidelines to secure this outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">The realignment of local delivery structures will reduce the overall number of local development bodies from 94 to 55, comprising of 17 Partnerships in urban areas and 38 integrated LEADER/Partnership bodies in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">My intention is to have the cohesion process completed in advance of the roll out of the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme. The €425.4 million funding referred to above is available over the 2007–13 lifetime of the Programme and, accordingly, I am satisfied that there will be no loss to community or development groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_1834">At this stage, local development bodies are in place in some 50 of the 55 operational areas agreed by Government.  The representative networks of LEADER and Partnership groups, whom I met on 31st January, have assured me that they are fully behind the Government's policy on cohesion and will endeavour to ensure that local delivery structures are in place across the full 55 areas in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1835">In one case, a LEADER group has made a complaint to the European Commission regarding the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 and, in particular, the Cohesion Process.  I am satisfied that our approach in this area is fully consistent with the European Regulations.  My Department is closely monitoring the position.</p>

Commission Regulation (EC) No 816/2004 sets out the specific Community aid rates applying for whole milk under the Scheme.  The aid rates were reduced by approximately 7% per annum from 2004 to 2007 in line with the general reductions in support prices brought about by the 2003 Mid Term Review of the CAP.  However, the Exchequer has made up for this reduction in the EU contribution, and the overall aid rates have been maintained at €27.89/100kg.  From 1 July 2007 the EU contribution is €18.15/100kg, with the balance of €9.74/100kg made up by the Exchequer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1887">I believe that schools have a role to play both in teaching students about road safety issues and in helping them to develop the attitudes necessary to promote safe behaviour on the roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others, can be developed and promoted among students. SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1889">In February of 2007, the Road Safety Authority launched the RSA MACE "Safe to School" campaign at primary level. Due for its second phase in February of this year, the programme is aimed at helping primary school children learn effective road safety lessons. The 2007 campaign covered walking to school safely, in 2008 the campaign is focused around the topic of Cycling to School Safely. A dedicated website, www.safetoschool.ie, has also been launched as part of the campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_1890">The Streetwise programme for junior cycle pupils was launched in UN Road Safety Week on 24 April 2007. It covers road safety across 9 topics — walking, cycling, seatbelts, airbags, speed, driver fatigue, motor cycle safety, hazard recognition and the engineering aspects of road safety, to be delivered over nine class periods.</p>
            <p eId="para_1891">In addition, a Road Safety programme for Transition Year, developed by the Road Safety Authority in collaboration with my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Second level Support Service is being piloted in schools in the current school year for rollout in the 2008/09 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1892">My Department will continue to work with the Road Safety Authority to strengthen the role of schools in promoting road safety even further.</p>
            <p eId="para_1893">In line with the Road Safety Strategy, my Department is preparing a template on a road safety protocol for inclusion in school plans. The target is to have this ready by the end of September 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1898">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government considers that as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  This view is informed by advice received from international experts on autism, the National Educational Psychological Service and the Inspectorate. An analysis of research — including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism — supports this approach too, while Autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1899">By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methods, including Applied Behavioural Analysis, the Government is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1900">The Department of Education and Science does support the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, the Department does not accept — based on research, advice and best practice — that it should be the only intervention used. It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1901">Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1902">Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1903">There are now in excess of 275 autism-specific classes sanctioned around the country.  A number of years ago, before this extensive network was in place, some centres were approved for funding under an ABA pilot programme. The Government is committed to long-term funding for these pilots subject to agreement on certain standards which will enable the Department support them as special schools for children with autism. Discussions have taken place with Irish Autism Action with a view to advancing this commitment as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1904">Other centres, including the one referred to by the Deputy, sought to be funded under the pilot scheme. However, now that a national network of special classes is available, new centres will not be brought into the pilot programme. We are determined instead to ensure that each child has access to the autism-specific education that is now being made available to schools throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1917">I would like to make clear that my Department is not preventing the operation of immersion models of education. My Department provides a range of supports to encourage the establishment of all-Irish schools and to encourage instruction and communication through Irish. The right of parents and children to choose education through the medium of Irish is fully respected, but this does not obviate the need for schools to implement all aspects of the national curriculum. What is at issue in this case is the requirement that schools should implement the minimum instruction time specified in the curriculum for English, and do so no later than the start of the second term in junior infant classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">The revised primary curriculum was launched in 1999 and provides an integrated programme of learning in the spheres of Languages, Mathematics, Social Environmental and Scientific Education, Arts Education, Physical Education, Social Personal and Health Education and Religious Education. Page 27 in the Introduction to the Curriculum states "It is a particular feature of Irish primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have experience of language learning in two languages." The curriculum also specifies a set of learning objectives for each area of the curriculum for 4 groupings — infant classes, first and second class, third and fourth class, and fifth and sixth class. It also sets out a suggested minimum weekly time framework for tuition. This provides that where a first language is being taught, there should be four hours instruction per week, and 3 hours per week where there is a shorter day for the infant classes. Where a second language is being taught, the suggested minimum timeframe is 3.5 hours per week, and 2.5 hours per week for infant classes with a shorter day.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">Furthermore the achievement of the curriculum objectives in every curriculum area at each of the four levels of primary schooling is an over-riding requirement in all schools. I have therefore determined as a public policy issue that the introduction of a minimum of 2.5 hours per week for English as Language 2 in Irish medium schools should not be delayed beyond the start of the second term in Junior Infants.  I am convinced of the importance of ensuring that all children have access to the full primary curriculum from the earliest possible stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1928">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now in the region of 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.  Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1929">A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07. The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years in order to reduce class sizes. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

        <b>Deputy Denis Naughten</b>
         asked the

         the developments which have taken place since the formation of the Government to improve accommodation and services for children with autism, Asperger’s syndrome, for children with a learning disability and to improve speech and language therapy and psychological assessments; her plans for 2008 to deal with these issues; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_694">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1931">In relation to improved facilities for children with autism, Asperger's syndrome and children with similar needs, the Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post primary school network. There are now in excess of 275 autism-specific classes sanctioned around the country, an increase of over 60 since the formation of the current Government. The National Council Special Education (NCSE) will continue to establish classes where the need is identified. As part of the continuing expansion of services nationwide I recently gave recognition to the Rehab Group to become the patron of a new special school for children with autism in Limerick.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that this is being actively progressed between officials from my Department and the IAA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1932">The Deputy may be aware that in order to support teachers my Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in specific interventions associated with autism including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  A recent initiative has been the expansion of the SESS to enable it to recruit a behavioural specialist support team, led by a person with a PhD in ABA.  Since May 2007 the number of psychologists employed within the NEPS service has increased from 128 to 138 and it is my intention to further increase this complement to 169 within 2008. In this regard, following a national recruitment process put in place in late 2007 by the Public Appointments Service, interviews are currently being held to form regional panels from which appointments to priority regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1933">In common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. A measure of the effect of the above mentioned expansion of NEPS psychologist numbers, in terms of assessments conducted, will be taken at the end of the current academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">The Deputy will be aware that a cross-sectoral team has also been established, comprising senior officials from my Department, the NCSE, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE to co-ordinate the implementation of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 and the relevant sections of the EPSEN Act 2004. Since the formation of the Government, a Minister of State has been appointed to have responsibility for Disability and Mental Health. The newly established Office for Disability and Mental Health will, through formal interdepartmental links, facilitate the delivery of integrated health and education support services for all children with special needs, including those with autism. As the Deputy will be aware the Health Services Executive is responsible for the delivery of health supports including therapies to children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">In 2002 my Department approved the provision of an additional 75 places on new courses in Speech and Language Therapy in U.C.C., N.U.I.G. and U.L. in addition to 25 places on an existing course in T.C.D. As a result there has been a significant increase in the numbers of Speech and Language Therapists graduating from universities in recent years. Some 93 Therapists graduated 2007 compared to 21 in 2004. It is understood from the Higher Education Authority that 109 places are currently offered annually on Speech and Language Therapy courses compared to 25 places in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1936">In relation to associated facilities the Deputy will be aware that during the period of the last National Development Plan 2000-2006 my Department accelerated the school building programme with record levels of investment and the streamlining of delivery systems. An aggregate total of well over €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second-level, including the provision of facilities for autism and other special needs pupils. This programme delivered over 7,800 building projects. The overall investment in school building infrastructure over the lifetime of the new NDP will be €4.5 billion, including almost €600 million for the school building programme in 2008. Generally projects required for special needs pupils receive a high degree of priority in my Department.  Significant development and improvements have been and will continue to be made in the range of areas identified by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1938">The Higher Education Grants Schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under the Higher Education Grants Scheme an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.  An approved institution is defined to mean a university, college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course, or courses, which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1939">Each year, the Higher Education Grants Scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the Schemes. The approved institutions mainly comprise of public funded third level institutions. I understand the course referred to by the Deputy is provided by a private college.  There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes to private colleges. Tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, is available on tuition fees paid to certain private colleges in the State.  Further details and conditions in relation to such tax relief are available from the candidate's local tax office.</p>

            <p eId="para_1948">I wish to advise the Deputy that the matter of the enrolment of a pupil in the centre in question is a matter for the Board of Management of the centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1949">I understand from enquiries that I have made, that the child in question is currently attending the ASD unit attached to the school referred to by the Deputy.  While my Department does support the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use, we do not accept — based on research, advice and best practice — that it should be the only intervention available.  It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1950">I understand from enquiries that the child in question is currently attending a special class.  At primary level, in classes such as the one this child is attending, there is a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants (SNAs).  An individual child can have access to full-time support from an individual SNA if he or she needs one.  In such situations, the school authorities should consult with their local Special Educational Needs Organiser.</p>

PSV Inspectors are issued with a range of protective clothing and safety equipment in addition to mechanical equipment such as hydraulic jacks and a complete set of mechanics tools.  The Garda authorities advise that they are satisfied that the Inspectors have access to the equipment necessary to support all aspects of their operational activities.  I am further advised by the Garda authorities that the specific cost of equipment issued to PSV Inspectors is unavailable as such costs form part of the overall costs associated with providing this type of equipment to the wider Organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2222">The Garda authorities advise that the surveying equipment referred to by the Deputy is used by Garda Forensic Collision Investigators and there are currently six sets of such equipment in use, one in each Garda region.  Each regional Assistant Commissioner has located this equipment in the most strategically placed Garda station in their region, for use by specifically trained personnel.  The availability, type, quantity and use of such equipment is kept under constant review by the Garda authorities within the context of their operational requirements.  The total cost of the Forensic Collision Investigation equipment was approximately €303,000 or €50,500 per set.</p>

            <p eId="para_2232">I am informed by the Commissioner that the personnel strength of Blessington Garda station, as at 31 January 2008, is 16.  For security and operational reasons, it is not Garda policy to disclose the number or percentage of personnel on duty in any specific area during any specific period of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2233">The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2234">I am informed by the Garda authorities that increasing the opening hours of a Garda station would necessitate the employment of additional Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2235">It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking all relevant factors into account.  In that regard, the needs of the Garda stations referred to will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2236">Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2237">I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</p>

            <p eId="para_2375">The Race Against Waste Campaign, which commenced in 2003, has been the most extensive waste information campaign ever run in Ireland.  The campaign combined a multimedia national awareness campaign and a supporting communications strategy which aimed to stimulate the prevention, reduction, reuse and recycling of waste.  It featured initiatives and practical measures that could be taken by individuals and businesses in helping to solve waste management problems, including extensive information on recycling and composting.</p>
            <p eId="para_2376">The campaign directly engaged specific audiences who are generating waste — communities, businesses, large organisations and homes — with the objective of improving environmental behaviour. It provided advice and information directly to the public through a lo-call telephone line and e-mail; ran a programme of action for businesses, including nationwide seminars; and informed the public through on-going public relations and advertising campaigns.</p>
            <p eId="para_2377">The main campaign concluded in October 2006 but certain elements have continued and a number of initiatives under the Race Against Waste campaign have been undertaken since then.   Information on composting and recycling is also provided through the Department's Environmental Information Service, ENFO.   In addition, my Department provides significant funding to the Green Schools Initiative, which is administered by An Taisce.  The programme encourages environmentally sound waste management practices and includes specific actions on waste minimisation, recycling and composting.  Over 2,800 schools are participating in the programme which represents 65% of all schools in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2378">Aspects of waste management will also be addressed as part of the Government's new major communications and public awareness campaign focusing on climate change.

         if his attention has been drawn, in relation to businesses and competitiveness, to the effect the new landfill tax will have on the private sector and particularly for small businesses here; and his plans to alleviate the costs in relation to these small businesses.

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_2383">I am not proposing to introduce a new tax or levy as the existing landfill levy has been in place since 2002.  I have announced my intention to increase, by 31 March 2008, the levy from €15 per tonne to €20 per tonne for waste legally deposited, and €20 per tonne to €25 per tonne for waste illegally deposited.  Landfill gate fees have fallen dramatically in recent years and this factor is impacting on the necessary diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill. The practice of deploying economic instruments such as landfill taxes as economic drivers to promote recycling and diversion of waste from landfill is widespread in the EU.  In the recently published National Waste Report for 2006, the EPA identified a number of policy instruments, including increased landfill levies, that could help increase the diversion rate of biodegradable waste from landfill and assist in the efforts to meet the very challenging diversion targets set for this waste stream in the EU Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC).</p>
            <p eId="para_2384">As the levy applies only to waste going to landfill, the proposed increase will encourage all sectors of society, including small businesses, to maximise their recycling and recovery of waste.  An increase in recycling rates by small businesses may lead to an actual reduction in their overall waste costs.  Therefore I do not consider it necessary to introduce any special measures to offset the potential additional costs of small businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2385">The landfill levy generates income for the Environment Fund that can be used for a range of environmentally beneficial purposes, including improved enforcement measures, grant aid of local authority recycling infrastructure and assistance towards the costs of remediation of closed or so called ‘legacy' landfills.  This increase will allow further support for local authority recycling infrastructure to assist acceleration in recycling activity which will, in turn, contribute to meeting the landfill diversion targets.</p>

            <p eId="para_2387">I placed a temporary Preservation Order on the national monument at Rath Lugh, on 28th September 2007, under Section 4 of the National Monuments Act 1954 (as amended).</p>
            <p eId="para_2388">To assess the stability of the esker on which the monument at Rath Lugh is located I commissioned a report from a firm of consultants with relevant expertise in this matter. The report I have received recommends that a number of precautionary measures be put in place to ensure that the esker is not undermined during the nearby road construction works or in the longer term. My Department is working with the NRA to ensure the ongoing protection of the national monument including the implementation of the measures outlined in the consultant's report.</p>
            <p eId="para_2389">My Department has also been in contact with Coillte, the registered owner of the lands on which the national monument at Rath Lugh is located, to agree on how the monument can best be protected both now and in the longer term. Coillte has assured us of its fullest co-operation to ensure protection is afforded to the national monument and of its continued engagement with the Department in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2390">All archaeological works in relation to that part of the national monument at Lismullen within the landtake for the M3 motorway have been completed in line with the statutory directions issued in this matter in June 2007. Post excavation analysis of all of the archaeological evidence recovered from the site has commenced and will continue over the course of the next 12 months. In accordance with its terms of reference the Lismullen Advisory Committee has provided, and will continue to provide, advice to the NRA and its consultants in relation to the analysis and reporting on the archaeological finds at Lismullin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2391">In order to ensure the protection of that part of the national monument which lies outside the land-take for the M3 motorway, I have entered it on the Register of Historic Monuments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2392">In relation to ongoing archaeological monitoring, all topsoil stripping and ground reduction works necessitated by the construction of the M3 are monitored by the archaeological consultants employed by the construction company.  Such archaeological monitoring was provided for in the Ministerial Directions for the M3 issued in 2005, and the method statement for the monitoring was approved by my Department in April 2007 prior to the commencement of the main construction contract.</p>

            <p eId="para_2406">The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2407">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</p>
            <p eId="para_2408">There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is underway.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas, including any unserved areas in County Cork, are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">The first phase of the procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete, and four candidates pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.  The four candidates were, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd. Consortium, Eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.</p>
            <p eId="para_2410">Following the withdrawal of the IFA/Motorola Consortium as a candidate, the remaining three candidates have now commenced "Competitive Dialogue" with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department's requirements for the delivery of broadband to the unserved areas of Kildare.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008, with rollout to commence as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
