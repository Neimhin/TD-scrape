        <heading>Comitology: Presentation.</heading>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Chairman" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_8">At its last meeting on 26 May, the committee considered a motion in the name of Deputy Mulcahy which was withdrawn following discussion to allow time to consider advice from the parliamentary legal adviser. The motion dealt with comitology rules. In the meantime, we asked the committee's consultant to prepare a report explaining the complex comitology procedure. The report was circulated on Monday. In her advice, the parliamentary legal adviser clearly stated that the comitology procedure is entirely consistent with the provisions of various treaties and the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">Discussions at the last meeting indicated clearly that there are legitimate concerns that a raft of important decisions may be taken without recourse to parliamentary scrutiny. Our consultant has checked the position with other national parliaments and found that none has arrangements in place to scrutinise decisions arrived at through the comitology procedure. I intend to make a proposal at the end of today's discussion before which it would be useful for our consultant, Ms Katherine Meehan, to take the committee through her report.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Ms Katherine Meehan</from>
          <p eId="para_10">I circulated a description of the comitology procedure to members. The nearest example in national legislation is the statutory instrument in respect of which there is a gap in terms of parliamentary scrutiny. The first page of my report provided a description of some of the background. I will take the decision on genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, as an example without giving its details. The decision followed all appropriate procedures. A series of decisions was taken and legislation was put in place outlining how GMOs should be handled and how decisions should be taken on a case by case basis for each organism as to the way in which it could be released for general use. There is a GMO procedure and what one might call the comitology procedure, according to which the GMO case was sent to a regulatory committee. The procedure is laid down in detail in another Council decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">It is clear that in every case the appropriate legislation was followed but that does not solve the problem of how to track a particular decision. I researched whether any other parliament had a system in place to track comitology decisions and found that none did. A senior civil servant at principal officer level is given instructions based on a Government decision on how to deal with an issue as it arises. The officer takes the issue through meeting after meeting of the regulatory committee but at no stage is it possible to know when it will arise on an agenda. Very often, it is not possible to know what the particular instructions given to the civil servant were as the general legislative framework within which the decision was made was already agreed. Therefore, there is no process whereby the issue comes back to Parliament or even Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">This has been a matter of considerable concern for many years. During the last restructuring of the comitology procedure which, interestingly, was intended to make it more transparent, a role was built in for the European Parliament. A structure was put in place whereby the meetings of regulatory committees could be reported on an ongoing basis to the European Parliament. As an outsider to the European Parliament system, I could not access or track this system and it is unclear whether in the instance of GMOs that procedure was followed. I was able to track the procedure of the regulatory committee. As it could not make a decision, the matter was referred to the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in April. It is quite clear in the Council minutes that while the matter came before it, a decision was not reached. The matter returned to the Commission which made a decision according to the procedures laid down under the GMO procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">It would probably not be a good idea to provide for a parliamentary scrutiny role in this particular process. Where a matter is returning to the Council, six to 12 months discussion and debate will already have taken place. For national parliamentary scrutiny to take place at that stage would only be to begin the process all over again. We should consider a more sophisticated system of scrutiny which cannot be overloaded to a greater degree than it already is and which does not delay normal administrative business which must proceed. The description I have provided does not constitute in any sense a solution to the committee's problem.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_14">Ms Meehan mentions in her note that there are four comitology procedures. These are the advisory, management, regulatory and safeguard procedures of which she outlined the first three. What is the fourth?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Ms Meehan</from>
          <p eId="para_15">The safeguard procedure entails relationships with scientific committees and so on. A standard procedure is in place but it is quite specialised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Chairman" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_16">This is quite a complicated area. Clearly, it has fallen outside the scrutiny process and must be addressed in some form. As the note makes clear, comitology covers the space between the legislative powers of the Council and Parliament and the implementing power of the Commission. We have an opinion from the legal adviser and a preliminary report from our consultant. The issues of transparency and accountability must be addressed. I suggest that we ask Ms Meehan to prepare a more detailed report on the matter which should be discussed and agreed by the committee in due course particularly as it relates to accountability and transparency. Following that process, we might consider whether to bring the report to COSAC for the committees of the 25 member states together with the European Parliament for them to consider in due course. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_17">Will the report include the steps to be taken to bring this matter into the scrutiny process?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Ms Meehan</from>
          <p eId="para_18">There is a great deal of literature on comitology but nobody else has cracked it yet. Hopefully, we will make progress.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Chairman" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_19">We will and the report will come to the committee in due course. I thank Ms Meehan.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">The other item on the agenda is correspondence. We received correspondence from the European Anti-poverty Network. It is proposed to note this item. Is that agreed? Agreed. We received correspondence from the Lithuanian Parliament enclosing the declaration adopted at the international conference on the enlarged EU and the wider Europe. It is also proposed to note this item. Is that agreed? Agreed. We also received correspondence from the Lithuanian Parliament in regard to a visit from the European Ombudsman. Is it agreed that we note this item? Agreed. We received a note on the proposal to amend the arbitration convention which aims to extend the provisions of the convention to the ten new member states. It is proposed to refer this directly to the Sub-committee on EU Scrutiny. Is that agreed? Agreed. We received a letter of thanks from the Turkish ambassador which we will note.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">We received a letter from Mr. Henry Rogers, an Irish national living and working in Italy. Mr. Rogers is involved in a long-term dispute with the Italian authorities in connection with the equal treatment of foreign workers. This committee has corresponded with Mr. Rogers in the past on this issue. Mr. Rogers has requested our support for his request to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, to intervene on his behalf with the Commission, which is taking an action against Italy in this case. Successive Irish Governments have sought to raise this issue, which, I understand, mainly deals with the position of lecturers who are not treated equally with Italian nationals. I propose to issue a letter of general support to the Minister of State, if the committee agrees.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Deputy Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_22">I do not know the full details of this case. However, would such a letter of support not open up the issue given that some foreign teachers in Ireland have said that we discriminate against them because of Irish language restrictions?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Chairman" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_23">This has been an ongoing issue and one which was live when I was Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs. The late Mr. Michael Ferris, in his then capacity as chairman of this committee, successfully lobbied the European Commission to open infringement proceedings against Italy during Ireland's last Presidency. We have consistently supported this and I do not think it creates difficulties for anybody living here. There is an issue in that Irish citizens living in Italy are not treated the same as Italian citizens, which runs contrary to Community rules. Successive Governments and committees have supported this approach and it would be consistent for us to do the same.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Deputy Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_24">As I do not have the full details I cannot say "yes" or "no". My point, however, is that the same could be said of this State because we have criteria which require teaching staff to achieve certain Irish language standards. If the question is just on the grounds of nationality, I have no problem with it.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_25">It is just on the grounds of nationality. No language issue is involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">Another issue is the recognition of qualifications, which is sometimes used as a barrier.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Senator Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_28">With regard to the various forums since 1996, it seems an extraordinary length of time has passed without any outcome.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Chairman" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_29">It is a long time. I dealt with this issue as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs from 1994 to 1997. However, the Commission is now involved and is pursuing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">I wish to report on the COSAC meeting in Dublin. The agenda for the meeting included a presentation by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, which was very interesting and lively.</p>

          <from>Senator Lydon</from>
          <p eId="para_31">I am sorry to interrupt you, Chairman. However, it is appalling that not one member of the committee was invited to that meeting. Therefore, I do not intend to stay and listen to discussion of the presentation.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_32">I do not know how it happened that no member of the committee was present. Members were entitled to attend and would have been very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">The main issues addressed were the scrutiny of EU business in accordance with the protocol on the role of national parliaments, the Lisbon Agenda, the implementation of the EU budget, particularly the Court of Auditors report, the involvement of European regional and legislative assemblies, the language regime in COSAC and proposed amendments to the rules of procedure. It was a very good COSAC meeting. There was a general feeling among members that for the first time we got down to dealing with business rather than with procedures. We have received many complimentary comments since the meeting. I pay tribute to the staff of the committee for the work they have done, which reflects extremely well on the Oireachtas and the State. The meeting went extremely well.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">I do not know why committee members were not notified of the meeting. All members knew it was on and I presumed they had all been notified. There was certainly no intent to keep anybody out or anything of that kind. I presumed when I did not see members there that they were occupied with the European Parliament elections. I do not know what went wrong in this regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Haughey</from>
          <p eId="para_35">I support your comments, Chairman, and agree it was an excellent COSAC meeting. I congratulate you on the manner in which you chaired the meeting and convey my appreciation to the clerk and staff of the committee for the tremendous effort they put into hosting this event and ensuring its success. It was generally accepted by all present that it was a very successful COSAC meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">On behalf of the Fianna Fáil group, I convey to you, Chairman, our sincere congratulations on your election to the European Parliament. I convey similar congratulations to Deputy Harkin. It was a great victory for both Deputies.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">I thank Deputy Haughey for his comments and also thank him for his assistance in chairing the COSAC meeting. A provisional date has been set for a committee meeting next Wednesday. However, that conflicts with questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs so I ask members to allow the Chair to set a time. If there is not sufficient business for a meeting next Wednesday, it might be left until the following week.</p>
