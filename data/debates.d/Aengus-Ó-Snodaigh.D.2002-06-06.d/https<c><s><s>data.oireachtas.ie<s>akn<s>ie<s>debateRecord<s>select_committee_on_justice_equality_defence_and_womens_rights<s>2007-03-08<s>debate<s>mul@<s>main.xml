          <p eId="para_19">Unfortunately I cannot accept the amendment.  While I accept the principle, the amendment is unnecessary.  It proposes to introduce a statutory requirement that the Act be reviewed at least every five years.  I have no objection to the Act being reviewed as often as is required and it is my intention and that of the Department that the Act will now be kept under constant review and amended as often as necessary having regard to developments in the law.  However, as I have already indicated in the House, I intend to initiate a second phase process to further amend the Defence Act later this year when the present proposals have been implemented.  This will provide an opportunity to review the operation of the Bill's provisions.  The insertion of a statutory time limit within which a review must be conducted is, therefore, unnecessary.  Such a provision could at some future date cause unnecessary difficulties.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">I understand the Minister's perspective.  However, a future Minister for Defence might not be as diligent as he is.  How can he assure us that the legislation will not be left on the shelf?  Has the Minister considered any mechanism that would provide that the legislation be automatically reviewed?  I understand that similar Acts across the water build in such a review.  While his intentions are well meaning, legislation on disciplinary measures in the Defence Forces is not something that immediately comes to the public's mind and there is no great impetus to review it.  An alarm bell will not go off in the Minister's head every 12 months reminding him to review the legislation.  How can we ensure that it will happen?</p>
          <p eId="para_21">I accept that we will see a second phase to this legislation.  Perhaps at that stage the Minister could have an automatic review.  Each year we consider an annual report on overseas service, the confirmation of disease levies and various other matters in other Departments.</p>

          <p eId="para_22">I support what Deputy Timmins has said.  The Minister indicated in the Dáil that he anticipated there would be a much larger number of courts martial.  He referred to the figure increasing to several hundred as a result of the appeal mechanism built into the process.  Clearly, therefore, the legislation will lead to a major extension in scope, particularly as the European Convention on Human Rights is being transposed into law.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Fundamental rights are at the basis of this proposal.  The Minister should, at minimum, produce an annual report detailing the operation of the legislation.  The Irish Human Rights Commission, which has examined and reported on the Bill, will be interested in ensuring that it meets its desirable objective of underpinning the military-judicial administration in a manner similar to that with which the regular administration of justice is dealt with.  There should be some in-built mechanism to examine how the legislation operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Will the Minister outline his proposals for phase 2?  Will they amount to a consolidation of existing legislation or an extension of the legislation before us?</p>

          <p eId="para_25">As members will know, the legislation is based on a detailed report.  It was not practical to include all the report's provisions in the Bill.  The Department has taken a minimalist approach to address immediate problems reasonably quickly.  As I indicated, more extensive legislation is on the way and it is envisaged the Department will introduce a separate Bill.  The two Bills can then be read together as one.  Alternatively, we could introduce a consolidation Bill but this will be a matter for discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">I accept the points made by Deputies Costello and Timmins on the need for consistent updating or at least an annual report.  I will examine the matter in the context of the new legislation.  It would be a little premature to do it now in view of the fact that we will introduce a new Bill.  Given that all parties are committed to new legislation, we need not worry who the Minister of Defence will be at the time it is introduced.  At that stage, this Bill will have been enacted and in operation and, as such, an opportunity will be available to ascertain how it is working in practice.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_30">14.—The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following after section 121:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_31">121A.—Where a person who is liable to military law is aged less than 18 years, the provisions of the Children Act 2001 shall apply.".</p>
          <p eId="para_32">Section 271 of the Children Act excludes members of the Defence Forces from the protection of the Act.  Persons may join the Defence Forces at the age of 17 years.  Effectively, therefore, persons will be in the Defence Forces for up to a year during which they will not enjoy the protection of the Children Act.  The Minister will probably argue that the matter should be addressed by amending the Children Act as opposed to in this legislation.  I ask him to outline his views on the matter, particularly in light of the forthcoming constitutional referendum on the rights of children.  Either this Bill or the Children Act will need to be changed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
          <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
          <p eId="para_33">The effect of section 271 of the Children Act is that any person under the age of 18 years who is an enlisted member of the Defence Forces shall continue to be subject to military law.  The intention of the amendment is that the provisions of the Children Act should take precedence over the provisions in the Defence Acts relating to military law as they apply to members of the Defence Forces who are under the age of 18 years.  I am satisfied that section 271 of the Children Act 2001 applies to a very small number of the members of the Permanent Defence Force.  In that regard, I am advised by the military authorities that less than 20% of the annual recruit intake is under 18 years of age.  In 2006, for example, only 81 of the 680 recruits, that is, 11.9% of the total, were under 18 years of age.  Nonetheless, special measures are in place to ensure that members of the Defence Forces who are under the age of 18 years are the subject of additional protections.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">First, all unmarried applicants under the age of 18 years must have the written consent of their parents to enlist.  Second, having regard to the 18-week recruit training programme, followed by a further advanced training course, I am assured that members are generally at least 18 years of age before they are deployed on operational duties.  Third, on 18 November 2002 Ireland ratified the optional protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child whereby it agreed to take all feasible measures to ensure that members of the armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities.  The effect of this undertaking is that members of the Defence Forces must be over 18 years of age before they are deployed abroad on peace support missions.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">As regards the application of military law to members of the Defence Forces who are under 18 years, a member of the Defence Forces may only be tried by court martial for the most serious of offences, such as treason, murder, manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault, if the offence is committed while on active service, which generally means while serving on a peace support mission abroad or during a time of war in Ireland.  As I indicated, a member of the Permanent Defence Force shall not be sent to any such overseas mission unless he or she is more than 18 years of age.  Any such offence committed within the State during peace time would be dealt with by the ordinary courts and the provisions of the Children Act would apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">In relation to other lesser offences, which are also offences punishable by ordinary law, if the offence was committed in the State by a person subject to military law under the age of 18 years, while a court martial might have joint jurisdiction to deal with these offences, in practice these offences are dealt with by the ordinary courts and the provisions of the Children Act apply in such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">With regard to breaches of military discipline within the code of military discipline committed by a member of the Defence Forces who is under the age of 18 years, it is important and proper that these offences are dealt with under the provisions of the Defence Acts.  Many of the provisions of the Children Act would not be appropriate in these circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">There is one further matter I consider to be relevant in this regard.  A new provision is included in the Bill whereby if a person subject to military law is sentenced to more than six months' imprisonment, he or she must also be sentenced to be dismissed or discharged from the Defence Forces and once such a person is dismissed or discharged from the forces, he or she will only remain subject to military law while in service custody.  The effect of this provision is that once a military prisoner serving his or her sentence in a public prison is discharged from the Defence Forces, he or she ceases to be a person subject to military law.  If such a person is under 18 years of age at that time, the provisions of section 271 of the Children Act would no longer be relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">For these reasons, I cannot, at this point, accept the amendment.</p>

I have outlined the position pertaining to people who are charged with serious offences, for example, treason, murder, manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault, who can be tried by court martial and those charged with less serious offences.  In practice, if somebody is under the age of 18 and can be subject to the court martial, the ordinary courts and the court martial will have joint jurisdiction.  Before a person goes before a court martial in this type of case, the Garda would have to agree.  I am informed that this never happens in practice and it is virtually automatic that such a person would go before the ordinary courts.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">Why will the Minister not accept the amendment which reads, "Where a person who is liable to military law is aged less than 18 years, the provisions of the Children Act 2001 shall apply"?  This would remove any doubt that children would be treated under legislation drawn up specifically to deal with adults, rather than arguing the case the other way and saying it is not likely to occur and that we do not envisage such a situation, as soldiers of this age will never travel abroad, etc.  Why can the Minister not accept the principle that the Children Act 2001 should apply in regard to any serious offence in respect of which a military court could be an option?  The purpose of the legislation is to ensure it is human rights proofed.  In that respect, the rights of children should be paramount.  It would be more desirable for the Minister to accept the point made by Deputy Timmins rather than taking the military point of view, which is to encompass the matter within the military administration of justice, even though the Minister is of the opinion it is never likely to happen.  Perhaps he might reconsider his position, even if it concerns phase B of his work?</p>

          <p eId="para_49">The fundamental legislation dealing with children is the Children Act which provides that persons under the age of 18 years who join the military become subject to military law.  I suspect that those who drafted the Act knew the situation and that there was no difficulty.  However, there is also a very good reason this provision should apply.  There are three categories under which a person can find himself or herself in trouble: he or she has committed a very serious offence, a less serious offence or is guilty of a breach of discipline.  Where somebody is involved in a serious breach of discipline, it is not appropriate that the Children Act should apply and that parents should attend for interview with the accused, etc.  In such a case the ordinary procedures of military law should apply to anybody charged with a breach of discipline, even where it involves somebody under the age of 18 years.

          <p eId="para_51">Those who drafted the Children Act inserted that section for good reason and we cannot unilaterally change it in legislation relating to the military.  To do so would be neither practicable nor desirable.  Even if one were to change it, it would be necessary to do so in such a way that the ordinary rules of discipline would apply whether persons were under or over the age of 18 years.  In practice, where persons are charged with offences, the matter takes some time to process.  A person can join the Army at 17 years.  Therefore, by the time a case is ready to come to trial, he or she will invariably be 18 years.  The danger is more apparent than real.</p>

One of the big changes in the Defence Forces in recent years has been the number of women who have joined.  A later reference in section 24 includes the words "charges against men".  One can assume there are other such references.  Presumably, the terminology is taken from earlier legislation.

It defines the term "man" as including "woman".  There is an amendment to this effect at a later stage.  I agree it would be preferable to use both genders or the word "person" but the legislation is to be read in conjunction with the 1954 Act.  If we were to make the change in this instance, we would have to change every reference in the 1954 Act also, but there is no need to do this because the Interpretation Act applies.  The reason the term "man" is used is to distinguish between NCOs and privates, on the one hand, and officers, on the other.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">The amendments in the Deputy's name seek to change the text of the Bill to reflect the communication made with the director of military prosecutions, or a member of his or her staff, on behalf of a complainant in proceedings, or on behalf of a person charged with or who believes he or she is likely to be charged with an offence, or on behalf of a person involved in the matter personally.  They do not come within the scope of the offence of improper communication with the director of military prosecutions.  I argue, therefore, that this matter is already addressed in the Bill which, as drafted, provides that communication with the director of military prosecutions made by legal and medical advisers, social workers and other family members of a person involved in the matter does not come within the scope of the offence.  Other possibilities do not need to be considered without opening up the provision too much.  The current provisions reflect the position in ordinary criminal legislation pursuant to section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974.  In the circumstances I cannot accept the amendment.  I understand what the Deputy is saying, but if I were to accept his amendment, as it stands, it would mean that anybody who purported to speak on behalf of a defendant could communicate with the director of military prosecutions.  That would not be appropriate.  Under ordinary law, the persons allowed to communicate with the Director of Public Prosecutions are confined to the categories I have included in this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">I would not accept that at all.  The Prosecution of Offenders Act has been in place for more than 30 years and has worked pretty well.  I have not heard complaints about people not being able to make representations if they want to do so.  It is proper that we mirror the Act in this instance and we should not open the door too wide.  It is wrong for people to try to interfere with prosecutions, regardless of their politics.  It is inappropriate on the one hand to state it is an offence to interfere with a prosecution or approach the person in charge of that prosecution while on the other hand stipulating that every Tom, Dick and Harry who says he is representing an individual should be able to communicate with the prosecution without committing that offence.  This would make nonsense of the provision.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">What does the Minister mean by "unwillingness".  Inability is one matter but "unwillingness" is a very broad term.  Does this mean the appointee can decide, on a discretionary basis, not to act and that he or she does not wish to be a member of the committee at a given time?  Are there any criteria in this regard?  Surely an appointee should be expected to continue unless there is a valid reason, through inability or incapacity, for his not doing so.  Unwillingness comprises a strange reason for not acting for a period as a member of the committee.</p>

The Prosecution of Offences Act 1974 transferred the powers of the Attorney General in relation to the prosecution of offences to the DPP.  Therefore, in the case of an ordinary criminal indictment, there are two parties to the laying of the charge — the People and the DPP.  That is reflected in the correct form for an indictment which is the People (the DPP) <i>v</i>. the Accused.  However, under the proposed provisions of this Bill, the Director of Military Prosecutions alone will prefer the charges under military law and the charge will be laid as the Director of Military Prosecution <i>v</i>. the Accused.  If the Bill were amended as proposed, the charge would still be laid in the same terms without alteration.  From that point of view the amendment is not necessary.</p>

As a result of its observations, the issue was the subject of detailed consideration during the Bill's drafting.  It included discussions with the Office of the Attorney General and the advice of external counsel.  For both policy and practical reasons, it was decided to opt for a uniformed military judge along the lines of the Canadian and US military justice systems rather than a civilian judge advocate and non-legal qualified officer system, which operates in the UK.  It was considered that certain aspects of the UK system would not be appropriate for our system to follow.  International case law does not preclude the appointment of military judges, subject to there being adequate safeguards as to their independence and impartiality.  In light of experience, this new arrangement and the views of the commission will be kept under review.  I am also informed there is a sufficient pool of legally qualified military personnel.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">We considered the observations of the Irish Human Rights Commission in section 40 which concerns the appointment of a senior member of a court martial board.  The proposed senior member was designed to replace the former appointment of president of the court martial.  However, I am satisfied now we can dispense with all references in the Bill to a senior member.  These amendments are proposed to give effect to that in respect of section 39 which deals with the constitution of general courts martial.  It is still necessary to retain certain rank structures in respect of a general court martial.  I am satisfied also the Bill contains adequate safeguards to ensure there can be no possibility of command influence among the members of the courts martial of different ranks.  Amendment No. 18 dealing with dissolution of courts martial is necessary as a consequence of the earlier amendments deleting all references to a senior member of a court martial.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_113">[M]ay include not more than one non-commissioned officer who shall not be below the army rank of battalion quarter-master sergeant[.]</p>
          <p eId="para_114">PDFORRA gave committee members a document which, perhaps, arrived only this morning.  It seeks to include all ranks.  I do not necessarily agree with that, but why was the rank of battalion quarter-master sergeant, BQMS, chosen?  How come the rank of battalion sergeant-major is excluded?  I would go some way with what PDFORRA is looking for.  It should, perhaps, include from the rank of sergeant or upwards.  At the very minimum, it should be senior NCO, to include company quarter-master sergeant, company CS.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">This matter was moved in the Seanad on both Committee and Report Stages and I am still of the same view.  The current provisions in the Bill are modelled on section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993.  I am not aware of any amendment having been made to date to section 5 of that Act.  Although I have no objection to the general intention of the proposed amendment, I do not consider it appropriate to depart from the current position in ordinary criminal law.  A practice now appears to exist of making it possible for a relative of the deceased to make a statement, rather than it being enshrined, for the moment, in law.  I am aware of the ongoing debate regarding the operation of these provisions in ordinary criminal law.  It would be appropriate to await the outcome of this debate and reconsider the provisions at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">Section 5 of the 1993 Act covers this situation.  The courts would appear to have taken the view that if a victim is unavailable, for example, in the event that he or she has been murdered, a relative can make a statement on his or her behalf before sentencing.  That is a fairly generous interpretation of section 5 of the 1993 Act, but nevertheless we cannot argue against it.  If we were do something else now with this section of the law dealing with a very small section of the population, it might give credence to the view that this interpretation is in some way incorrect.  Therefore I would prefer matters to go through the normal process.  However, if they change it as a result of the debate, to put the matter beyond any doubt, we will mirror that change.</p>
