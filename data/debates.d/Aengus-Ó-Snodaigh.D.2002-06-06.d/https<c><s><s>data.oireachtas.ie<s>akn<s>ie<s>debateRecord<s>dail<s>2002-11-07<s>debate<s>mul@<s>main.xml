        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_125">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_164">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_165">For about a decade or so, the issue of dormant assets has attracted sporadic attention from Deputies on all sides of this House, as well as media interest in the potential there might be for the State to put these funds to good use. Failure, on the part of financial institutions to trace the owners of these moneys has long been a matter of public conjecture and concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">Following on from the recommendations made by the Committee of Public Accounts Sub-Committee on Certain Revenue Matters, in its Report "Parliamentary Inquiry into DIRT" in 1999, I instructed my officials to set to work considering the complex constitutional, legal, operational, prudential and investment issues involved. This exercise led directly to the legislation which I brought forward last year, the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001. This dealt with dormant assets held by banks, building societies and An Post.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">When drafting that legislation, it became apparent that application of the scheme to insurance products would prove more complex than was the case with accounts in banks or building societies. Therefore, for the sake of considering the matter further and to allow time to gain expert advice, it was decided to provide for unclaimed life assurance policies in a separate Bill. This Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Bill is the result of considered and detailed analysis of the issues peculiar to policies of life assurance – not least, the analysis of EU law in the insurance sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">I was aware that the successful development and implementation of the proposed scheme would require the full co-operation of the insurance undertakings and their representatives, as well as the advice and co-operation of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Revenue Commissioners. I am pleased to say that assistance from all these parties was always forthcoming and of enormous benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">This Bill builds on the Dormant Accounts Act. As is the case with that Act, this Bill achieves what I consider to be the best and most equitable balance between the rights of policyholders, and the desire that neither the insurance undertakings nor the State should be burdened with an unduly bureaucratic scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The first purpose of this legislation is to ensure that proper steps are taken by financial institutions to identify and contact the owners of dormant funds. In that regard, this Bill is essentially a consumer protection measure, designed to protect the property rights of individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">If, however, the owners of funds cannot be traced, the institutions will be required to transfer those funds into a special fund established for the purpose, the Dormant Accounts Fund, to be established next year by the National Treasury Management Agency. However, no individual loses his or her right of access to these funds. The rightful owner will have a guaranteed right to reclaim funds at any time.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">In the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, I introduced a scheme for the disbursement for charitable purposes, or purposes of societal and community benefit, of funds which are not likely to be reclaimed. Moneys transferred to the fund under this new legislation will also be subject to that scheme, and therefore subject to disbursement. However, sufficient funds will always be held back to meet any potential claims from persons with an interest in these funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">As Deputies will appreciate, there are any number of different types of life assurance policy on the market, as these products are often tailor-made to suit an individual's needs. This has a significant bearing on two important aspects of the Bill – the amount that an insurance undertaking will be required to transfer to the Dormant Accounts Fund in respect of an unclaimed policy and the criteria for dormancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">There are a number of issues to consider in relation to what is owed to an individual under any particular life assurance policy. Unlike a bank account, the money is not there up front in a way that the customer and the insurance undertaking know exactly what is owed on any given day. First, the majority of policies provide risk cover as well as having an investment element designed to secure a lump sum for the policyholder at some future date. In practice, the weighting of these two elements varies widely depending on the needs of the policy holder and therefore, the type of policy in question. Second, the investment element may be underpinned by a company's asset-managed funds, as in the case of unit-linked policies. If the policy is a with-profits type, it will have other conditions attaching to it. Third, a life assurance policy is a contract that sets out the conditions under which a claim can be made, and by whom, be that when the policy has matured or, for example, by a beneficiary on the death of the policy holder. The amount to be paid out by an insurance undertaking is affected by all these factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Given the complexities of the issues surrounding the measurement of the encashment value of a life assurance policy, it has been impossible for my Department to build up an estimate of the amount of dormant funds held by the life assurance undertakings. Nevertheless, the amount is likely to be significant. Of course, the total value of any such policies is not the reason for moving forward with this legislation. Of primary importance is the need to make people aware that these policies exist and remain unclaimed.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">As regards the amount to be transferred from any given policy, the insurance undertakings concerned will be required to calculate the net encashment value of the policy on the date of transfer. This will be the total amount that would be payable by the insurance undertaking if the policy holder were to realise the proceeds of the policy on that date. This is to be calculated net of any insurance considerations. A similar calculation will apply to the payments from the fund to the insurance undertaking in the event of a claim being made under the policy subsequent to the moneys having been transferred to the fund. Thus, the fund will only receive the assets which represent the investment portion of unclaimed policies. The amount required to provide insurance cover for the policy holder will remain the responsibility of the life company.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">In relation to the relevant period of dormancy, following consultation with industry this will depend upon which of the two main policy types is being considered – those with a specified term which mature on a specified date, or those with no specified term. For the specified term policies, dormancy will occur where there has been no customer initiated communication with the insurance undertaking for a period of at least five years from the later of the date the policy matured or the date the policy holder last made contact with the undertaking. For policies with no specified term, dormancy will occur where there has been no customer initiated communication with the undertaking for at least 15 years. Deputies will recall that 15 years is the dormancy period applicable to banks, building societies and An Post under the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">The scheme which I am now proposing will provide a legislative framework which will improve regulation in relation to the handling and management of funds in mature but unclaimed life policies. Further, it will mirror and harmonise with the scheme which has already been put in place under the 2001 Act for banks, building societies and An Post.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The scheme will require all insurance undertakings operating in the State to actively take all reasonable steps to identify the beneficial owners of dormant life assurance policies with a view to at least alerting them to the existence of those policies. In the event that the owner or owners cannot be traced, the net encashment value of those policies will be taken into the care of the State, while guaranteeing the right of the ben eficial owners to subsequently seek a refund. The moneys will be held in the dormant accounts fund, to be established next year by the National Treasury Management Agency. The remit of the agency will be to prudently invest the moneys received from all the institutions, having regard to the possibility of claimants seeking a return of their moneys at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">As the Deputies are aware, the 2001 Act already encompasses a scheme for the disbursement of surplus dormant funds for the benefit of charities and the community at large. Broadly speaking, the projects or programmes to benefit will be those designed to alleviate poverty or social deprivation, or to assist those who are physically or educationally disadvantaged. The current Bill provides that any moneys transferred from insurance undertakings to the fund will also be included in any disbursement scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">I would now like to set out a few of the key principles enshrined in the legislation which will be applicable to unclaimed life assurance policies. I should, perhaps, remind Deputies that while I am bringing forward the framework legislation it is my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who will have primary ministerial responsibility for the scheme once it is up and running, especially for the disbursement aspects. This mirrors the existing position with regard to dormant accounts in credit institutions. The definition of Minister in section 2 provides for this to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">I am very conscious that the moneys we are dealing with derive from the private property of individuals and that as such, they must be handled and invested extremely prudently, having regard to the constitutionally guaranteed right to private property and to the confidential nature of the relationship between the insurance undertakings and their customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">The proposed scheme will apply to all insurance undertakings in the State and to all policies for life assurance which have been taken out by Irish residents, other than policies which form part of the assets of occupational pensions schemes, group health insurance or disability benefit schemes and sponsored superannuation schemes. The application of the provisions of the Bill is set out in section 6.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The fundamental basis for the scheme lies in how dormancy is assessed. As I have already indicated, under the proposed scheme, a non-specified term policy will be deemed unclaimed where the insurance undertaking has received no customer-initiated communication with respect to the policy for at least 15 years prior to commencement of the scheme. A specified term policy will be deemed unclaimed where the policy holder has made no contact with his or her insurance company in relation to the policy for at least five years from the later of the date the policy matured and the date the policy holder last contacted the company. These definitions, which are set out in section 6 of the Bill, will be applied uniformly by all insurance undertakings.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Insurance undertakings will be obliged to personally notify customers whose policies are valued at €500 or above that they have an unclaimed policy with that undertaking and notify them of what steps to take to reactivate that policy or make a claim under it. For the sake of all other customers affected by the scheme, that is policies valued at less than €500 and non-correspondence policies, the insurance undertakings must place annual notices in two or more national newspapers. These annual advertisements, the first of which is scheduled to take place next January, will generate public awareness of the scheme. My hope is that this will encourage policy holders, or their heirs or executors, to make contact with the insurance companies to see whether they stand to gain under the terms of a policy held at that institution. Notification procedures are provided for in sections 8 and 9.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The framework provides that the net encashment value of unclaimed life assurance policies, where the policies remain unclaimed by March each year, must be transferred by the insurance undertakings to the dormant accounts fund to be established early next year. The first transfers will take place by April 2004. These matters are provided for in sections 10 and 11.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The National Treasury Management Agency will be required to invest these moneys prudently, based on guidelines which I will help to draw up, but having regard to the need to meet the costs of making repayments to valid claimants seeking a return of their moneys. The main issue here is that not only is a claimant entitled to a return of the moneys transferred to the fund, but also to any interest and any investment return that he or she would have been due on those moneys, had they remained with the insurance undertaking. The moneys in the fund will generate an investment income, some of which will be used to offset the costs of accruals payments to claimants, and the rest of which will be re-applied to the fund. In that way, as set out in sections 14 to 16, policyholders are guaranteed the maintenance of their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">The Bill also provides that the regulatory authority, currently the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment but at some point the proposed Irish financial services regulatory authority, is entitled to appoint inspectors for the purpose of ensuring compliance by the undertakings with the provisions of the legislation. The inspectors will be authorised to check that an insurance undertaking has the necessary systems and procedures in place that will ensure undertakings are attempting to make contact with the policy holders, and that all relevant moneys are being transferred to the dormant accounts fund. Inspectors will be entitled to inspect the undertaking's records for these purposes and will have access to any relevant records held by the National Treasury Management Agency in respect of transfers to the fund. The provisions with regard to inspections are contained in sections 18 to 25 inclusive.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">Having highlighted these main features, I would now like to recap. In summary, the Bill provides for identification of the types of policies and undertakings to be covered by the scheme and those policies which will not be captured; the period of dormancy applying; the obligations of the insurance undertakings in relation to notification of policy holders that their policies may be deemed unclaimed; the procedure, including the timeframe, within which moneys which remain unclaimed are to be transferred to the dormant accounts fund to be managed by the National Treasury Management Agency; and the obligation on each undertaking to maintain a register of unclaimed policies which will contain the name and particulars of each policy holder whose policy has been deemed unclaimed. It will also contain details of the class of policy, the amount transferred to the dormant accounts fund and the date of transfer to that fund; each undertaking to be obliged to complete a certificate of compliance with the provisions of the legislation, in order that any failure on the part of undertakings can be quickly identified; the role of inspectors, whose remit will be to check compliance with the legislation on the part of the insurance undertakings; the maintenance of confidentiality in relation to ownership of the moneys in unclaimed policies; and amendments to the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001 to ensure the entitlement of the NTMA to manage and invest moneys realised from unclaimed life assurance policies and to entitle the board to disburse surplus of such moneys.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">The scheme established under the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, enabled us to begin providing for a systematic approach to the regulation of dormant and unclaimed assets. It allowed for greater transparency in their treatment, as well as providing for an equitable and socially beneficial use of any surplus moneys identified. The current Bill, which is the result of lengthy and productive negotiations, represents a significant extension of that process and provides for a harmonised treatment of dormant assets throughout the financial services sector. It reflects the fact that the insurance sector is, for the most part, regulated by way of EU directives, but it goes further in focusing on the particular concerns we all have with regard to consumer protection when policies have long remained unclaimed. The Bill is an innovative piece of legislation and I commend it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMcGrath" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_191">The Fine Gael Party will be broadly supporting the thrust of this Bill and will be facilitating its passage through the House. This Bill is a mirror image of the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, which arose from the hearings of the DIRT tribunal and the hearings carried out by my former colleague, Jim Mitchell, when he was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. It was identified that, within the banking structure, there were a lot of dormant accounts which were held, in effect, to the benefit of the banks in question. Arising from that the Minister brought  forward the Dormant Accounts Bill, which became the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001. This Bill is a follow-on into the insurance sector and it is a good move which we welcome on this side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The controls in the insurance industry are complex and the Minister alluded in his speech to the difficulties in providing legislation that will capture all the dormant policies that might lie within insurance companies and having the moneys transferred into this dormant accounts fund. The insurance industry, by its nature, is complex in that many policies are tailor-made to suit the individual. It will be difficult to police the insurance industry and ensure that dormant policies are transferred into the dormant accounts fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The Minister, towards the end of his speech, made reference to having inspectors to police the structure or the possibility of having inspectors to do this work. When he is replying to this debate, will he indicate if he intends to take on staff to do this on a full-time basis or will he be doing it by way of bringing in consultants to review the matter from time to time? It would be quite an expensive business if people had to be brought in with the kind of expertise needed to examine various insurance policies and companies, to look at what they are doing and to come up with returns at the end of the day. Perhaps the way forward might be to bring in consultants occasionally to do that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I expect that the Minister will indicate to us in his reply the positive effects arising from the Dormant Accounts Act in respect of bank accounts. What kind of money has come forward?</p>

          <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_196">Therefore, there is nothing in the account as yet. I wondered what the position was and I am glad to have had the Minister's clarification.

          <p eId="para_197">I am a little concerned about how this money will be spent. Will it become a slush fund for the relevant Minister to disperse to Fianna Fáil organisations across the country—</p>

          <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_199">—or will there be strict controls over how this money is given out? Sometimes, for example, we are concerned about the way in which national lottery funds are used and the fact that Ministers may be giving out their largesse to various clubs and organisations in their constituencies purely on the basis of a Fianna Fáil Minister delivering to a Fianna Fáil-dominated organisation. Will that happen—</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMcGrath" eId="spk_132">
          <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_201">—or will we have greater control over how the money is to be dispersed? I know the Minister laughs at what I am saying but there is concern that that kind of thing happens. It happens not just with regard to discretionary funds, but with regard to mainstream funding as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">For example, in my constituency in the run-up to the last general election, a certain politician with the help of the Minister announced that moneys had been set aside for a certain school. It appeared on a website that this school had been approved to go to tender, but I was told yesterday by way of a parliamentary reply that this is not the case. We had announcements by a person who is now a Deputy in this House and a photograph with the Minister and the parents' council saying that moneys had been approved. This has not happened. That example is in respect of mainstream funding for school buildings, and I am concerned by how funding that would be more loosely established in the dormant accounts fund, will be used. What are the criteria by which it will be dispersed? Maybe the Minister will answer this when summing up.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I am also concerned about the contact that has to be made to establish if a policy is dormant. The legislation proposes that the people in question should be contacted by ordinary post. I am not sure that is rigorous enough in respect of trying to find somebody. It should at least be registered post and there should be a further stipulation on the follow-up criteria that should be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">This was brought home to me forcibly in recent weeks when a young man in his thirties, who was a client of mine for a while, approached me. He was taken into care with his brother as a young man and, subsequently, both his parents died. They had a house in Mullingar which they had vested from the local authority. They were still in care and the house was reacquired by the local authority by way of compulsory purchase order. It transpires that the local authority went through the rigours of the law in terms of establishing who was the owner of this property. The rigours of the law in that case, as the Minister probably remembers, involve pinning a notice to the door of the property. Apart from that, what one would do is quite scant.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The young man was actually in the care of the State and if there had been a scrutiny of the full documentation in respect of this family, this would have emerged quite clearly. Nothing happened and he is now looking for his share of the cake on the grounds that this property was taken from him unfairly, unjustifiably and immorally, and that he is morally entitled to reasonable compensation. It will be a major job to establish that and to get the local authority to do that. It may have to go to court, but I hope not. When the procedure was put in place for a compulsory purchase, pinning a notice on the door of the prop erty probably seemed a reasonable thing to do. Surely if people have an interest in property they will see a notice pinned on the door.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">In terms of insurance policies, if one is simply writing to Mr. and Mrs. Jones of Trim Road, Naas, or wherever it is, and that road has been demolished, there is a greater need to make the insurance company try harder to establish if those persons still exist and where they might be.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Perhaps one could find them by looking at records of brokers who sold the policies or by looking to see if the people in question had legal advisers at the time. If people have an interest in a property they will see the notice. A greater onus should be placed on insurance companies to try to establish if policy holders or their heirs still exist. This could be done by examining the records of brokers or legal advisers.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The dormant accounts legislation has imposed provisions on An Post regarding savings bonds and savings schemes. Usually these are long-term investments and account holders are now required to periodically reinvest their accounts to ensure they do not fall within the remit of the dormant accounts legislation. While it is good that account holders should be advised of the position regarding their accounts from time to time, there is a need to carefully consider how this aspect is implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The insurance industry is intensive and competitive. Insurance companies often recruit young people who make their livelihoods on the commission from the sales they make, both of new policies and in having existing ones upgraded. It is a cut throat business. In the past couple of weeks I was visited by a young agent who persuaded me to upgrade a policy. I was flabbergasted at the raft of documentation I was required to fill, including a two page document seeking information on the most personal information regarding my insurance policies, property and so on. When I refused to provide it he told me it was a mandatory requirement under Central Bank regulations. I still refused and sought clarification from the Central Bank. If the bank requires the return of such information there is a need for much greater regulation on the control of its dissemination.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The Minister and I are probably around the same age, so he will recall the way mortgages were procured when we were younger, although as he was much wealthier than me, being an accountant, he probably did not need a mortgage.</p>

          <p eId="para_218">Many borrowers were left in serious trouble while financial companies were able to write off their liabilities. Companies are covered by the small print of the policies they sell, which advise customers of changing investment values and returns. Tight controls must be maintained on the way the insurance industry conducts its business. For example, the Minister said the first purpose of the legislation is to ensure that proper steps are taken by financial institutions to identify and contact the owners of dormant accounts. I ask him to accept my concerns and attempt to strengthen the criteria by which efforts are made to contact policy holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">It is important to ensure that the National Treasury Management Agency wisely invests the proceeds from the dormant accounts fund. The Minister said the remit of the agency will be to prudently invest the moneys received from all the institutions. The agency will shortly issue its report on the management of funds under its control over the past 12 months. It will be interesting to note the size of the returns. In this regard it is worth noting that the pension reserve fund has sustained some major losses because of investment in equities. In terms of individual companies, some such investments were substantial.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">I am concerned with the need to invest these funds prudently. Given what has happened to equity shares over the past 12 months, perhaps the Minister will review the best type of investment for public funds. He is ultimately responsible for ensuring that such funds are used wisely and he will be required to account to the public for what has happened. Perhaps he should question the investment in equities and consider other types of investment, such as property. My party argues that given the infrastructure shortage, the pension reserve fund should be invested in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">I welcome the Bill. It is a follow-on from the dormant accounts legislation and we will support its passage through the House.

          <p eId="para_227">I wish to share time with Deputy Joan Burton. The Labour Party warmly welcomes the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Bill, 2002. It obviously follows from the DIRT report and from the dormant bank accounts procedures which we put in place recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Life assurance policies are a vital form of saving, widely used throughout society. Many people who never get the chance of having realisable investments have some sort of life insurance particularly in relation to the purchase of a first house. It is important that we put in place some measure to put dormant accounts to use for the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The Bill appears to be relatively straightforward, which is to be welcomed as life insurance is such a complicated business and we should not add to the considerable red tape involved. Most people have policies, especially in regard to house purchase, which continue after the purchase has been completed. It is very easy to lose contact with companies. Scotland is one of the centres of the world insurance market and very often key companies are based in the UK without an Irish office, making it difficult to maintain contact between the consumer and the customer.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">I query the limit of €500 imposed by the Minister in section 9 in regard to the size of policies to which these procedures would apply. In section 8 it is indicated that the policy will be deemed "unclaimed" as per the terms of this legislation, where the value of that policy is more than €500. There is a separate procedure which I do not consider as good, for policies with a value less than €500 which are deemed "non-correspondence" where there has been failed attempts to contact  the policy holder. Sections 8 and 9 need to be looked at in more detail on Committee Stage. The term of five years in regard to "specified term" policies is also one that we need to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">This morning we were treated to a discourse from the Tánaiste from somewhere in California, in which she warned us that very hard times are ahead.

The Minister knew a year ago that the sums did not add up but he blatantly went out and raided the social insurance fund. Instead of being able to provide extra resources and facilities for workers, such as parental leave, he brazenly snatched money from that fund which we had built up in good times. Combined with that he threatened the Central Bank and continues to adopt a very threatening pose towards the European Bank in Frankfurt in regard to the reserves here. We have a desperate Minister who is grasping at every penny on which he can lay his hands. This leads one to believe that although the basic principle of this legislation is beneficial there is the worry that it is just another gimmick by the Minister to try and cover over the mistakes he has made. Probably his most tragic mistake was the special savings accounts.</p>

          <p eId="para_251">I would not mind being Minister for Finance, I know it was Deputy McCreevy's life ambition as well. The Minister has made serious errors of judgment. Unfortunately, when we see him introducing decent legislation, as this is, at the back of our minds we are asking if Charlie Mandrake is up to his old tricks again. We wonder if he is weaving a spell trying to get through another tough day in the Oireachtas. When the Minister leaves office in two, three or five years he will leave difficult financial circumstances. That is the concern shared by all sides of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">I also have fears regarding the disbursement proposals. We are all waiting to see how Deputy Ó Cuív, who has been waiting many decades to become a Cabinet member, is going to handle his new Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The conversation between the officials of the new Department and the Department of Finance regarding its budget must have been interesting. Is the Minister going to fund core community project jobs? The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, told us this morning that she is going to slash such jobs to around 15,000 next year. Many community projects are going to devastated. I urge the Minister to use the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to provide a separate and new funding mechanism for those community projects. Deputy Ó Cuív inherited the community section of the old Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The problem for the community section is that it had a derisory budget of £9 million or £10 million in recent years. The Minister might consider how projects around the country might continue to be funded where workers are carrying out useful jobs for their communities.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_269">I wish to share time with Deputies Ó Caoláin and Breen. On the surface, this legislation is difficult for us to adopt a negative position on. It is Robin Hood legislation and that is an innovation for the Minister who is used to giving and taking in a different direction. We should question whether the bona fides of this and the earlier Bill are from where the Government is coming. It is legislation that is not without difficulties. I hope that many of these difficulties can be ironed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The Government seems to be engaged in doublethink in terms of how the national accounts are presented. The National Development Finance Agency Bill will be debated soon. It will put forward the pretence that finance will be borrowed but it will not affect the national borrowing figures. However, we have legislation like this which gives the effect that assets are being acquired by the State and will be used as part of its expenditure programmes, even though the State has not acquired them through traditional and logical means. The Government cannot have it both ways. It cannot pretend that it is not borrowing,  nor can it pretend that it is not acquiring money in less than effective ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The Minister should be aware of difficulties in the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001. This Bill should be used to put the necessary amendments in place. I received a letter about a dormant account that I was administering. I was a community development officer for Muintir na Tíre and the account was over 12 years old but I did not have any signing authority on it. Contact was lost because it was an account for a voluntary organisation and the people working with it changed on a regular basis. The sum involved was €230. It is ironic that under the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, this account, if not properly accounted for, would be subsumed into a larger fund that is supposed to allocate moneys to other voluntary bodies. An amendment must be made so that the funds used, whether they are generated by bank accounts or life assurance policies, are specified and greater effort should be made to locate accounts which have a more corporate structure and will benefit certain groupings because of the circumstances in which they find themselves. I hope that scenario will not be repeated under this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Will the Minister clarify the nature of future Robin Hood Bills he may bring before the House to deal with lottery winnings, prize funds, prize bond funds and possibly the special savings investment scheme? Will people avail of the benefits that accrue from those savings? Will legislation be introduced so that funds acquired through the scheme will be apportioned similar to those under this Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The mindset behind the legislation needs to be challenged whereby the moneys for the Department concerned and the organisations that benefit from it must derive from such funds. Voluntary and community groups are always added on extras. They receive money from the national lottery and the dormant accounts fund and are set to benefit from unclaimed life assurance policies. The Government has not been willing to allocate Exchequer funds to voluntary and community groups. The Minister needs to be challenged on this because there has never been an acceptance of the value added contribution of volunteerism which provides social services that are not provided in other countries where the state plays a more direct role in funding such services. The Minister is prepared to assist the work of such organisations only through mechanisms such as the dormant accounts fund and that is not the type of funding model that should be promoted or the type of society that should be encouraged.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The definition of regulations relating to life assurance policies in terms of dormancy and the power of inspectors to seek information and how to use such information to ensure money is made available under the dormant accounts fund are necessary. However, in terms of imposing additional administrative work on financial institutions, should this be a role for the inspectors or, given the other problems there have been with  such institutions throughout the years, could the inspectors have a more direct role in procuring all the information the Central Bank and other regulatory authorities need in regard to the conduct of businesses in the financial services sector?</p>
          <p eId="para_275">If there are unrealised assets within the insurance industry, should the level of premiums for life assurance policies be reduced and should reforms be promoted with the industry in general? I appreciate this is the responsibility of another Minister but there is a great deal of consumer disquiet about these aspects of the industry and the Government has not displayed much intent to bring about the necessary reforms wanted by consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Certain aspects of the legislation need to be amended, particularly those relating to the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, to take account of irregularities that have arisen since it was passed. I look forward to tabling amendments on Committee Stage, having them considered and, hopefully, accepted by the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">I thought the Minister said "suspended" and I hope that would never happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Like the Act which gave rise to it, the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, the legislation is a long overdue measure which could and should have been enacted long ago. The moneys identified under the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, and those it is proposed to target under this legislation, were accumulating in the coffers of the hugely wealthy financial institutions. The DIRT inquiry in 1999 found that money in dormant accounts represented what was described as "free capital" for the financial institutions and they were able to use it as part of their capital base, further enhancing their ability to make vast profits. It is far better that these dormant moneys should benefit society than be used to swell the coffers of banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Given the record of the Government, I am pleasantly surprised that it has acted on the DIRT report recommendations at all, especially when it comes to delving into the vaults of the financial institutions. It is not something for which the Minister for Finance is noted. It is a start, which I will accept in that spirit, but there is long way to go before the banks and insurance companies, in particular, are truly called to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">In his speech on Second Stage of the Dormant Accounts Bill in June of last year, the Minister for Finance stated, rightly, that he was concerned  there was no onus on credit institutions to trace the owners of deposits lodged with them and it was up to clients or next of kin to come looking for their money. He stated: "The days of personal banking, in which bank staff knew their clients and notified their dependants in circumstances where the account holder died for instance, have long passed."  I have some personal experience of that relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">However, the Minister was not correct to say the days of personal banking are over. Now more than ever first class personal service is offered by the financial institutions but, regrettably, only to those with the largest sums on deposit or who offer the greatest profit incentive. New financial institutions are thriving on such exclusive business. The wealthy clients of these private banks do not need to worry about dormant accounts or insurance policies. Their finances are managed for them to the nth degree to ensure the maximum return.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">On the other hand – this is something on which the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs agrees – the banks are closing branches throughout rural Ireland, showing open contempt for customers who have been doing business with them for decades, very often older citizens whose money these financial institutions were glad to have when the economic climate was much less favourable. No amount of public relations spinning by the financial institutions can disguise this strategy to deliberately turn their back completely on the smaller depositor and the smaller community and concentrate all their activities in the most lucrative urban markets and in the international money market.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">This Bill, and the previous Bill, place new obligations on the financial institutions. These obligations are made necessary by the change in practice over the years whereby customers are no longer given the courtesy of an annual statement of account or any reminder of their business with the institutions. I am glad some degree of accountability is being imposed. It is sad such accountability must always be imposed by legislation. The institutions will not be accountable willingly. Why can we not go further with the principle of making the financial institutions accountable? I hope the Minister will be enthusiastic to the task.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">In his speech on the Dormant Accounts Bill, 2001, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said we were entering uncharted waters and that it raised complex constitutional, legal, operational, prudential and investment considerations and matters including the right to private property and the implied contract of confidentiality between financial institutions and their customers. It now seems those complex difficulties have been overcome. The lesson is that where there is a political will, there is a legal way. I ask the Minister to follow that logic and extend the principle to other areas of financial activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Irish banks and insurance companies are some of the most exploitative in the world. The banks enjoy a return on their equity which is double the EU average. We have banks which are among the most profitable in Europe. We should examine the reality of how they deal with their customers in this jurisdiction. They charge customers for a range of services for which their directly comparable counterparts in Britain do not. Their sister financial institutions on the neighbouring island and in the North apply a completely different set of criteria in relation to charges <i>vis-à-vis</i> customers. Why are we being treated punitively and differently in this jurisdiction? These services include the setting up of an overdraft or a direct debit, account maintenance charges and ATM withdrawals and lodgements.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The country is rightly convulsed at present over the insurance issue. It is scandalous the Government and the EU are allowing the insurance industry to ruthlessly exploit customers through gross overcharging and profiteering. This is having a huge knock-on effect in terms of employment and the cost of living. If the principle is accepted, even in this relatively modest Bill, that these institutions should be more strictly regulated, it should apply to all their activities. That must include price control and strict regulation of charges and costs. I would like that reflected in the thinking of the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The financial institutions must also be called to account for their role in assisting people to evade and avoid tax. If we can target dormant accounts, we should be able to target active ones, including offshore accounts which are used by the super rich to avoid their social obligations in this country. Only yesterday the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, told the Dáil that Clancy Barracks, which should have been sold to Dublin City Council for social housing, had been sold to a property company based in Jersey. I do not believe that property company is based in Jersey for the good of its health.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The Bill needs to be more clear about the use to be made of the funds accruing to the Exchequer as a result of the legislation. I concur with Deputy Boyle that the funding accruing from the legislation must be ring-fenced and taken on board by the Government. The beneficiaries should include those who assist citizens who cannot afford expensive financial and legal advice in the State. The Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet should consider public and community service bodies, such as the money advice bureaux and the free legal advice centres. These are only two examples of deserving areas where the money accruing from the implementation of the Bill could be directed. That would bring an improved service to the people who need it most and it would help to bridge the ever-widening gap between rich and poor.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBreen" eId="spk_186">
          <from>Mr. J. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_291">I have some reservations about the Bill because there are major omissions from it. I ask the Minister to take my points of view on board. A weakness in the Bill, as outlined by the Minister, is that if an insurance company does not have communication with a policyholder in the previous five years, it is insufficient for it to write to the last known address. I am sure the Minister is aware of the amount of mail which arrives at apartments and flats for tenants who no longer live there. The mail is often thrown in the bin. The same happens in rural Ireland. I am sure the Minister is aware from his recent canvass of the number of empty houses where mail is thrown inside the doors and not opened. If a reply is not received from the correspondents, the insurance company should check the original application forms for an address for the parents of the person concerned or his or her next of kin. Letters should then be sent to those addresses.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">As regards the nomination of a third party as the beneficiary of money from a policy, if an address is not available, it is not sufficient to put a notice in two national newspapers. That was all right when there were only two national newspapers, but there are many more now. Advertisements should be placed in the local newspaper and in the Sunday newspapers. Many people only get the local newspaper and one national newspaper on a Sunday. They would not know that an insurance company had advertised about dormant accounts. Many policies were taken out when people were young and had left home to live in flats. The amount of money accruing from those policies is low. That is a weakness in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">The State is not obliged to establish the beneficiaries of such money. However, the State is in a stronger position than insurance companies to do so. The application forms should include a person's date and place of birth and that should make it easier to find his or her records, including PRSI and old age pension records. That should also facilitate the State to advertise their existence in a relevant local newspaper and on local radio. I do not have a problem with the Minister seeking reimbursement from the State for costs incurred in trying to find the owners of such funds. If there are dormant policies and there is insufficient money to pay the costs, the funds should go directly to the dormant account fund. If policies were set up but people did not subscribe to them and only a small amount of money matured after a number of years, it should go to the fund. Where policies have matured but have not been claimed, the insurance companies and the State must make a better attempt to take stronger measures than are outlined in the Bill to establish the beneficiaries or true owners of such funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">The Bill, as framed, establishes a system by which the State will take over from insurance companies in grabbing these moneys and will have no duty towards their true owners. The reason the Government is interested in these  moneys is undoubtedly connected with the current state of the public finances. We were told during the election campaign there would be no cuts, secret or otherwise. What has happened since the election?</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Last night a Government backbencher voiced opposition to the introduction of higher education fees, only to return five minutes later and vote with the Government on the matter. Is this the type of policy the Government proposes to pursue? It is not good enough that the State should acquire a policy from its holder without taking all reasonable efforts to locate the person in question. For this reason, I ask the Minister to incorporate in the Bill measures giving effect to my concerns.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_187">
          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_296">Deputies have raised a number of highly interesting questions. While it will be a matter for the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to answer them, I wish to correct one major misunderstanding. Contrary to what has been said here, both dormant account Bills stipulate that the money will always belong to the person with legal title to it. Every effort must be made to locate the owners of accounts and return to them their money. Appropriation of money, which would be a very serious matter, will not happen. The reality, however, is that the funds in a number of accounts will never be claimed. Therefore, rather than leaving them dormant, it is proposed to put them to good purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Deputy Ó Caoláin, to whom I listened with great interest, missed a great line. When he started waxing lyrical about people receiving excellent personal service from financial institutions, I expected him to name the credit unions as the providers of such service to the small people on the ground. Instead, he seems to believe the only people who receive personal attention from financial institutions are the very rich. As a longstanding proponent of the credit union system, it is my understanding that the credit unions and, to be fair, some of the branches of the banks, provide a very personal service to their customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">I ask Deputies to be reasonable. We live in a commercial world. If those of us who are committed to rural Ireland want it to develop, the best way to proceed, for instance, in the event of the commercial banks pulling out of a town, is to work towards getting a credit union established in the town in question. There were no financial institutions where I lived. During my period as chairman of the local co-operative we managed to persuade the credit union to set up a branch office in our village co-operative and because this facility had not been available prior to that, we moved forwards rather than backwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Similarly, arrangements have been made with An Post to make available banking services at post offices across the country. I have never believed one cannot open a better window when  someone closes a door. My attitude to the development of rural Ireland has always been that if one person is unwilling to do something, one finds another who is willing to do it. By adopting that attitude, we do not become prisoners of other people. Instead, we become creative inventors of new and better ways of doing things and providing improved services. In the coming years those who succeed will not be those who see the end of the world and insoluble difficulties in every problem, but those who regard every problem as an opportunity. Some of the best things I have done in my life have been about turning unwelcome problems to my advantage and creating opportunities from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The Bill is a major step forward and I congratulate the Minister for Finance and his officials on the speed with which it has been brought before us. Deputy Ó Caoláin expressed surprise that the Minister introduced the Bill so quickly. The reason he is surprised is he does not understand the Minister who, while not a person who wears his heart on his sleeve, is genuinely concerned for ordinary people. Where other people talk, he acts. Having dealt with him for years, both as a Minister of State and now as a Minister, I have never found anyone more willing to take action when approached with reasonable proposals aimed at benefiting ordinary people. He does not make a great song and dance about it, but gets on with the job at hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">This Bill is a companion of the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001. Members will recall that it was originally envisaged that the Dormant Accounts Act would also deal with unclaimed funds in life insurance undertakings. The Minister decided, quite rightly, that because of the complexity of dealing with the life insurance issue, the best approach would be to proceed with dormant accounts as they related to the banks. His decision has been vindicated by the fact that we will now be able to begin operating the provisions regarding dormant accounts in banks in the summer of 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The Bill will create another source of funds for the dormant accounts scheme. However, I emphasise that the main purpose of the legislation is to reunite account holders, policyholders or their beneficiaries with moneys which lie dormant and unclaimed in various institutions. In other words, the primary purpose is to try to return the money to its rightful owners. The secondary purpose is to ensure the money is not left lying dormant if for some reason one cannot identify the owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">I commend the very successful public awareness campaign last spring which was run jointly by the Department of Finance and the then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The campaign sought to draw to public attention the new arrangements for handling dormant accounts through a week long series of advertisements on radio and in the national newspapers. Members may have read or heard the advertisements in the media or noticed the litera ture now on display in the offices of banks, building societies and An Post.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">While my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has introduced the Bill and has responsibility for legislating in this area, I will have primary ministerial responsibility for implementing the Bill once it has been passed, particularly in terms of its disbursement aspects. My Department, therefore, has ministerial responsibility for the nice part of the legislation, namely, disbursing the money in the fund. For obvious legal reasons this will be done at arm's length. My responsibilities are to implement the legislation, appoint the members of the dormant accounts fund disbursements board, whose remit is to oversee the scheme of disbursement, and ensure the appropriate administrative support is provided to the board to enable it to carry out its important functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Building an inclusive society is a priority for the Government. In creating the new Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, it demonstrated its commitment to ensure a more cohesive and co-ordinated structure is established to support work in this area. We all agree a co-ordinated approach is badly needed to ensure the money we spend gets to the people we want to get it and is not lost in a maze of schemes and bodies. As a person who has worked on the ground for years, it is clear this is one of the most urgent tasks facing the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Responsibility for a large number of projects and programmes in the community and voluntary sectors which were previously administered by various Departments is now under one roof. The Leader programmes, ADM, the community programme aspects of the old Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, all gaeltacht and island schemes, CLÁR and RAPID are now dealt with by one Department and I will do my best to make them much more accessible and user friendly to those they are meant to serve, particularly the disadvantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">It is logical in that context for responsibility to disburse the dormant accounts fund should come under this new structure. One of the key principles of the 2001 Act was the decision to establish a National Treasury Management Agency to regulate and manage the dormant accounts fund. A truly modern society must be distinguished by its care for the disadvantaged and excluded and by its commitment to constantly update that care. In bringing forward this legislation, the Government is continuing where the last one left off. It sees the dormant accounts scheme as an integral part of the strategy of tackling exclusion. I remember the great cross-party interest and the high standard of debate which characterised the passing of the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, and I am sure that will be replicated on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The legislative system that has been put in place to deal with dormant accounts and unclaimed funds is original, which is great. We are not simply aping legislation from some other  jurisdiction, we are leading the field and there has been huge international interest in what has been done. I hope we can continue to set such standards and that through the operation of this scheme by the board we will dovetail this fund with existing Government expenditure to ensure that comprehensive systems are available in the areas on which the fund is focused.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Mar Aire, sílim gur céim mhór chun cinn í go bhfuil an Bille seo faoi bhráid na Dála.

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_315">I welcome the chance to say a few words on this important Bill. I supported the Dormant Accounts Act and I support this Bill in the same context, preferring to see dormant funds and unclaimed insurance in State hands rather than those of the banks or insurers. The only thing that worries me is a matter already commented on by my colleague Deputy McGrath, which is the danger of this becoming a slush fund. He mentioned Fianna Fáil, but I expect the Progressive Democrats also have a great interest in that. The last budget showed clearly that other structures were not safe when the Minister was desperate for money and he called on all sorts of outside funding groups, such as the Central Bank, to balance the books. We do not want to see that again. I am aware on a personal level that there is a great need for health services and disability funds, and in my local area Monaghan hospital  lacks money. Those funds are sought from whatever source possible and I would not mind if money from dormant accounts or unclaimed insurance was spent in that positive direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">There are a number of problems in the insurance industry and there are funds which cannot be traced, as was the case with banks. Some companies make an effort every second or third year to discuss customers' policies and update them or force them to buy more insurance. By doing so they have an opportunity to update the next of kin because people die at all ages and nobody ever knows where a person has a private account. I hope through this or some other legislation insurance companies will be forced to call back regularly and to keep updated information on every customer's account to ensure that less of this money is untraceable. There is a need for insurance companies to make a genuine effort to keep in touch with their clients. With much of their money being paid by standing order they acquire it more easily than in the old days when they sent people around weekly or monthly to collect two shillings from their customers. Now they have access to simplified, low-cost methods of collection and the least they can do is ensure every two or three years that the information they have is valid. Anything they need can be traced easily.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I worry about a total reliance on An Post. My colleague, Deputy Ring, referred this morning to the matter of An Post perhaps sending letters to private houses for sorting and there is a need for the Minister to ensure that problem is solved as quickly as possible. Normally the service provided is good, but it is not realistic for insurance companies to rely on a registered or ordinary letter to trace next of kin. I urge proper, ongoing discussion and I thank the Minister for his speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Banks and building societies demand life assurance and it is only right for the sake of families left behind or the employees of a self-employed person that significant borrowings are insured in the event of death or long-term illness. It is up to the banks to ensure that they have records of the next of kin to minimise the amount that goes into any fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I cannot help but refer to the Minister's comment about credit unions. They have given an absolutely outstanding service in rural areas and they have now become more involved in cities. Banks that were very big in industry only a short few years ago have closed their offices and it is fantastic to see credit unions operating. I do not apologise for mentioning the branches in my home area. They include Clones, Emyvale, Monaghan, Castleblayney, Carrickmacross, Ballybay and Cootehill. They form a group and advertise as such to minimise costs so they can provide the best possible service to their clients. Their regulations provide that their customers' debts die with them. Their policy shows how this matter, in terms of insurance, can be dealt with, given that not only life assurance but other forms of insurance are of major interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I wish to raise a matter that may not seem relevant to the Bill but is important, namely, the sale of assurance policies by ruthless salespersons to people under pressure. People are often pushed into buying assurance policies that are not in their long-term interests. While the Oireachtas has addressed this area in the past, we need to update legislation in this area to ensure there is full transparency. It is not sufficient for policy holders to be asked to check the contents of their policies; they should be forced to have them independently checked to ensure they are worthwhile and make economic sense. I know of many people who paid large amounts of money in terms of their incomes for assurance policies only to find they were of little or no benefit. In some cases, they lost everything when they could not afford to make their repayments.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Some salespersons almost force policies down people's throats, a practice with which the Oireachtas must deal. To that end, investment in shares and the purchase of insurance are matters that should be covered in the education system so that students from transition year onwards are fully briefed on the benefits of all types of insurance. People who take out loans from banks or building societies are often forced to buy assurance policies with which they are not familiar and which, in many cases in recent years, have not covered even the benefits they were supposed to cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I wish to make a few comments on the distribution of funds. Community groups and others will benefit from the provisions of this Bill in a similar way as they will benefit from the provisions of the Dormant Accounts Act. The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cúiv, referred to the need for simple structures. It is a bureaucratic nightmare for community and disability groups to obtain funding in that they have to apply for funds to many different organisations. I beg the Minister not to implement further structures for the disbursement of funds to such groups. The Government, county councils and other relevant structures should be used for this purpose. We do not want politically motivated or nominated organisations involved to ensure the money does not go to them. I make no apology for saying that.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">We want this fund to be dealt with in an open and transparent way by civil servants and others who will make sure it is disbursed on an equal basis. Irrespective of how much money the Minister for Finance claims is available, there will never be enough to provide fully for the needs of those at the lower end of the scale. If this fund together with the fund under the dormant accounts legislation is used to benefit the disabled, the socially displaced and others, we will have done a good job. Irrespective of whether the fund is small or large, I hope it will go towards not only those in need but to service groups under threat because of the action of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in removing personnel from community employment schemes. This House does not realise the tremen dous benefit of those schemes to those most in need. I hope the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will listen before it is too late and make sure the majority of those involved in CE schemes are allowed to continue to participate in them. Perhaps some of the funds accumulated as a result of this legislation could be channelled through community employment schemes to benefit those most in need.</p>

        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_192">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_324">While I support the Bill, I have some misgivings about it in so far as it empowers the State to requisition or seize the encashment values of inactive life assurance policies and use them for charitable and social purposes. If our experience of Fianna Fáil's renowned largesse with national lottery funding is anything to go by, we can expect the hard saved fruits of people's prudence to be doled out and neatly timed to coincide with the next general election. In acts of blatant political expediency, no doubt determined by whether a constituency is marginal or otherwise, Fianna Fáil's favourite charitable and social purposes will be the beneficiaries of people's short memories. To quote former US President, Ronald Reagan, "We have done a lot, we'll do more". Fianna Fáil is nothing if not consistent when it says "A lot done, more to do".</p>
          <p eId="para_325">I strongly advise people to check with every insurance company with which they may have done business to ascertain if an inactive insurance policy may exist. People should not let sleeping policies lie. A conservative estimate of the amount of money languishing in unclaimed policies is in the order of €45 million with sums upwards of €36,000 commonplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">When the Minister for Finance cast his sights on dormant bank accounts some years ago arising from the report of the Committee of Public Accounts on DIRT evasion on deposits in bogus non-resident accounts, little did he realise the bonanza he was about to reap – upwards of €1.7 million. There were allegations arising from the DIRT inquiry that some financial institutions were profiting from dormant accounts and inactive insurance policies. Now the Minister proposes to supplement this pot of gold with another €35 million which he has filched from non-suspecting policy holders whose policies have been inactive for 15 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The principal redeeming feature of the Bill is the requirement for financial institutions to keep a register of such policies to facilitate policy holders in reclaiming their money. Insurance companies have not been exactly over-zealous in seeking to contact holders of inactive policies. Now the onus will be on the companies to make contact with the holders of accounts where there has been no transaction initiated by the customer for upwards of 15 years. Insurance companies will be required to make every effort to contact policy holders by writing to them and by annually placing advertisements in the national daily newspapers. When people took out home loans in the  past invariably they also took out an assurance policy to cover the loan. When the loan was cleared, many people may have thought their interest in the policy lapsed with the final repayment. However, policies such as these often had "with profits" or savings features which could realise many thousands of euro today.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Confidentiality prevents life assurance companies from advertising the names of policyholders to whom money may be due. However, this should not prevent them from making strenuous efforts to contact their former clients. For the State to requisition or seize policyholders' cash and use it for charitable or social purposes seems to constitute a massive liberty on the part of the Government. Could such a proposal be open to constitutional challenge by people who feel they might have a valid claim on a policy? This is a question to which the redoubtable Mr. Denis Riordan will, I am sure, be applying his not inconsiderable expertise and constitutional knowledge in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I hope all life assurance policyholders will examine their memories to ascertain whether they may have inactive policies. In this way they can head off the Minister's seizure of their assets – an action reminiscent of the activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau – and ensure they are not subsidising his favourite charitable and social causes. I also hope the moneys discovered in these accounts will be applied in the areas in which they are found.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I share Deputy Breen's concerns about national daily newspapers. Everyone is aware that, in the past, when people wanted to hide planning applications they placed their notices in the national newspapers because they knew that people do not necessarily read them. In some instances, notices were translated into Irish so that people would not read them. Notices should be placed in local newspapers because people read them and insurance companies, if they want to be successful in their efforts, would have a better chance of locating clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I echo Deputy Crawford's comment that some of the money located through the provisions in the legislation should be invested in Monaghan General Hospital. I do not mind from where such money comes.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</from>
          <p eId="para_332">I thank Deputies for their support for the Bill and their contributions to the debate. Before addressing the issues and concerns that have been raised, I wish to recall briefly the background to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The question of dormant assets in financial institutions has been a matter of debate here and elsewhere. The 1999 report, Parliamentary Inquiry into DIRT, recommended that action be taken to put these funds to good use for the benefit of the community at large. Following a detailed examination of the issues involved, the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001 was introduced to deal with dormant assets held by banks, building  societies and An Post. This Bill provides for the extension of that legislative framework to the more complex area of life assurance products.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The main features of the proposed legislation, as already outlined, are the obligation on life assurance undertakings to notify the holders of unclaimed policies of the existence of these policies; where the policy holder cannot be traced, to require the undertaking to transfer the net encashment value of the policy to the dormant accounts fund; the preservation of all the rights of the policy holder; and measures to ensure compliance with and, if necessary, the enforcement of these requirements. These features are similar to those contained in the Dormant Accounts Act, but the detailed provisions also take into account factors particular to life assurance policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The legislation provides that the amount to be transferred to the dormant accounts fund is only to be the investment of the unclaimed policy, such that matters relating to the continuation of insurance cover remain exclusively with the insurance undertaking. As persons such as the beneficiaries of the policy and heirs are more likely to be claimants in respect of life policies, they and others who may be entitled to payment are included in the definition of policy makers for the purpose of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">With regard to the issues raised by Deputies, to avoid the perception that the Government would use the moneys involved as some kind of slush fund it was always proposed and subsequently effected that an independent board would be established to distribute the surplus moneys from the fund. This board was appointed earlier this year and will distribute the surplus money, subject to guidelines in the 2001 Act, without direction from Government. In this way there can be no question of the Government having any involvement with the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Deputies McGrath, Broughan and Crawford raised the question of how the fund will be operate and be managed. The fund will be established by next April under the auspices of the National Treasury Management Agency, which will control and manage the moneys therein. The moneys transferred to the fund will be split between two accounts – a reserve account and an investment and disbursement account. Moneys in the reserve account will be primarily for the purpose of meeting repayments to claimants. This account will also be used to meet the expenses of the disbursement board and any costs incurred by the agency. Moneys in the disbursement account can be disbursed by the board to successful applicants seeking funds for relevant programmes or projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">To ensure the rights of claimants, a safety mechanism has been built into the legislation to ensure there is always enough money in the reserve account to meet the cost of repayments to claimants. Should there be a shortfall in that account, the NTMA is to move money into it from the disbursement account, thus curtailing any planned expenditure of that money by the board. As a further precaution, should it transpire  that the moneys in the disbursement account are not adequate to meet the cost of reclaims, the agency will be permitted to borrow the shortfall from the central fund on the basis that this money is to be repaid to the Exchequer once moneys come into the fund again. The relevant programmes and projects that are to be designated will include, for example, projects involving the alleviation of poverty and social disadvantage, programmes to help children with learning disabilities, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I again thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_195">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_342">I welcome the Bill, which is a Fine Gael measure in large part. It was originally introduced as a Private Members' Bill in 1999 by former Deputy John Farrelly but was rejected by the coalition Government at that stage. It has been on the table for approximately two years and the timing of its introduction is interesting. A recent "Prime Time" programme highlighted the regulation of bouncers and the violence that occurs in and around nightclubs and pubs, particularly those places that cater for young drinkers. There has been a flurry of interest in the legislation since that programme was televised.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The reason this Bill is before the House is that the Government is afraid the wrong signal will be given to the public by not dealing with this issue. The only reason the Government is paying any attention to this issue is that "Prime Time" is doing documentaries about it. It would not be the first such instance. There was a flurry of Government activity after programmes about clerical sex abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">A couple of days ago the Criminal Justice (Illicit Traffic by Sea) Bill was introduced. It dealt with drug interdiction and the fact that in two circumstances the Naval Service, Customs and Excise and An Garda Síochána cannot board vessels with drugs which are coming into or passing this country. It is a matter of national security as  well as a tremendous concern to the law enforcement agencies that this Bill has not passed all Stages in the House and been enacted. In five months the Dáil has not passed any legislation aside from that dealing with the referendum. That is sad. Perhaps if "Prime Time" made a programme about the fact that the Naval Service cannot board vessels and broadcast it on a Tuesday or Thursday night, we might see some action on that legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The Government is reacting to the media and to RTE's programmes. It is not reacting to the priorities in daily life, the issues that are enormously important to people. We have, effectively, government by media.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">This Bill is an indictment of the Government and the lack of action in the past few years on issues such as street violence. One is taking one's life into one's hands when one goes out for a drink, particularly in urban areas. The fact that the House is dealing with a Bill to regulate bouncers shows how bad the situation has become. Gardaí cannot do this job because they do not have the resources. This is a stopgap measure, pathetic in some respects, to prevent the violence that is affecting young people today. The industry should be regulated but the message here is that we are losing the battle on the streets, if we have not done so already.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Aside from regulating bouncers, we need to start thinking about regulating the establishments concerned. Superpubs and similar establishments catering specifically for young people have sprung up throughout the country. The phenomenon has increased in the past five years. If no onus of responsibility is put on proprietors to have regard to the consequences of filling a youngster full of alcohol, the situation will get worse. I am not talking about traditional public houses but of the huge superpubs which cater specifically for young people. Unless they have some regard for serving visibly drunk young people, the situation will get worse, if that is possible. That is what gardaí tell me. They are extremely concerned that there is no sense of responsibility on the part of some of these proprietors when it comes to serving drink. They could not care less how smashed these people get or whether, on leaving the premises, they might shove a knife into somebody. If we are to deal with this problem, we will have to impose and enforce an onus of responsibility on the proprietors of such establishments.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The use of CCTV has been urged a great deal in the past three or four years but we have yet to see it. Waterford city is still waiting for it. The town council in Dungarvan has repeatedly asked the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a grant to install CCTV. It is told that the prospectus for the system is ready but the application forms are not. That is ridiculous. The Government promised more funds for CCTV but it simply has not delivered. A certain District Court judge voiced a particularly good idea  recently when he said it should be mandatory that CCTV be installed inside and outside every nightclub. The Government should take that on board. We need to do that. Furthermore, any new pub being built should be mandated to have CCTV installed. It would act as a deterrent. The cost would be borne by the proprietor but it would be an effective one.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">We have lost the battle for the streets. Bills such as the one before us are necessary but they are an indication of how bad things have become. Gardaí are retiring in massive numbers. It appears there will not be anywhere near the number of gardaí in 2007 that the Government promised before the last election due to the retirement rate. It is particularly worrying that gardaí in the middle management ranks are retiring in numbers we have never previously seen. All the Government is able to do is come up with these "cutesy" measures, as I call them.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Another example is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill. It came before the House in June and we have not seen it since. It was supposed to be the cure-all for public order offences and street violence. Has the Government conceded that it is a waste of time? Gardaí certainly think so. The Bill does two things – it imposes a barring order on an individual if he or she causes trouble in a premises and, second, shuts down a premises that is the scene or location of continual trouble. Gardaí tell me they do not have the resources to go after young fellows who commit a crime in a particular place. They have a hard enough time dealing with the street crime that already exists. Has the Government finally conceded that the Bill is ineffective for dealing with street violence? I believe it has.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The Bill before the House is purely a licensing measure. I cannot see where the standards are outlined. There is no indication in the Bill of the appropriate standards for the companies to be licensed. With regard to the breaches that occur, we are talking about the unlawful use of force or assault. In effect, the security firms are taking on the role of the Garda Síochána. It is an admission by the Government that there are not enough gardaí to police and protect people.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Sections 16, 17 and 18 deal with declarations of interest and the propriety of discharge of any Government function. The provisions are necessary but they are also an indication of the Government's failure to enact comprehensive anti-corruption legislation. We will probably see these provisions in other Bills but if this problem is to be dealt with effectively, the Minister will have to pass comprehensive anti-corruption legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform inherited the failed legacy of zero tolerance. I agree with many of the things the Minister has done since taking office and some of his ideas are innovative. However, unless the Government prioritises crime and starts putting the necessary resources into the Garda Síochána to deal with  street violence nothing will improve. The crime statistics issued every three or four months will only get worse unless it is made clear that if a person commits a public order offence he or she will go to prison. Middle class people laugh at the idea that judges will order offenders to pay €200 or €300 into the court poor box. A fine of €300 for a first public order offence is not a deterrent. Parents must understand that they are responsible for the actions of their children, otherwise they will not give a damn.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The situation has become so bad that we will be back here in a year's time to debate introducing the Army reserve into urban areas, rather than licensing private security firms and bouncers to protect people outside clubs. The Garda Síochána has admitted it cannot do it, which is an indication that the Government has failed in this. The Minister may say that is my opinion, but it is the opinion of the general public and the Garda Síochána. It has been proven by the crime statistics that have been issued over the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Unless crime and related issues are prioritised and the Garda Síochána is properly resourced the problem will become worse and more people will be stabbed and shot on the streets of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford. It is not a laughing matter. The Minister has not dealt with it and zero tolerance has failed. We have been here for five months, yet the House has not passed any legislation to deal with this problem. The Oireachtas committees were formed yesterday to deal with all sorts of legislation but five months into the new Dáil we are still waiting for the Public Order Bill to go through the House. It is pathetic.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_196">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_356">I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on his new position. I hope he does as good a job as he did in adult second-chance education in his previous portfolio. I welcome the Bill. I recall that the former Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, originally established the consultative group on the private security industry. The group's report was produced towards the end of 1997 and the former Fine Gael Deputy, John Farrelly, produced a Private Members' Bill the following year which sought to implement the recommendations of that report. Fine Gael certainly has a strong tradition of trying to control the private security services industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">This Bill effectively seeks to implement the recommendations of the consultative group's report five years later, but if the Government had accepted former Deputy Farrelly's Bill it could have been done in March 1998. This area has been neglected and should have been dealt with long ago, so the legislation is long overdue. An excellent report was produced in 1997 by all sectors concerned with the private security industry as represented on the consultative group, including the Garda Síochána, IBEC, the trade union movement and the private security industry itself. While that report was clear and concise, the same cannot be said for this Bill's provisions, wording,  presentation, headings and sections, which do not clearly designate the relevant sectors as they should. There should be a clear delineation between the providers of private security services and their employees. The manner in which the legislation is presented is confusing. It would have been more desirable if a clear distinction could have been made from the beginning, so that the duties and standards required for each section could be clearly presented. Yet the confusion continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">The private security industry is in need of proper regulation and control, and I welcome the proposal to establish the private security authority in order to control and supervise individuals and firms providing security services. In his contribution yesterday, the Minister stated that "society has undoubtedly become more security conscious" in recent times, and the work of private security companies "has broadened into new areas and occupational activities". It has become pervasive in many aspects of our lives, yet there has not been any proportionate regulation and control of the industry, which has been neglected entirely.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">During the debate on, the former Deputy Farrelly's Private Members Bill in 1998, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, made an amazing statement when he said:</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The Government should only regulate where there is clear need to do so or where the public interest would be served by such regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">For crying out loud, surely there was a clear need to regulate this industry? The previous Minister's inane and self-serving statement makes a mockery of any meaningful response from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The current Minister's statement indicated yesterday that the private security industry is quite large with an annual turnover of €250 million. That is a substantial figure. He indicated also that approximately 400 companies are involved in it, although I am sure the figure is larger now since the same number was quoted in the 1997 report. I presume, therefore, that at least 500 companies are currently involved. Some 12,000 people are estimated to be working in the industry on a permanent basis, as distinct from part-time employees and those working in the black economy, which is probably as many again. Those figures are substantial compared to the current strength of the Garda Síochána. It shows therefore that the private security sector employs more people to enforce the law of the land than the State does. No one would suggest that we should not regulate the behaviour of the Garda Síochána, yet until now we have not lifted a finger to regulate the private security industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Those involved in the provision of private security services, particularly door supervisors – known as bouncers – at night-clubs and other venues, are undertaking a particularly difficult job. They are on the front line in providing secur ity for the owners and customers of such premises. Their work involves an enormous degree of responsibility and most of those in the trade take the job very seriously. Most do a good job but, as we well know, there are unfortunate exceptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Members of this House may be familiar with the case of a young Corkman, Adrian Moynihan, who died tragically as a result of a fracas with a bouncer at Sidetrax night club in Cork city on 25 March 2001. This tragic event was brought home to television viewers in graphic terms when video footage from the incident showed a very strenuous headlock on the young man by a bouncer which led eventually to the removal of the victim by ambulance and his subsequent death. Thankfully, this matter was forwarded to the DPP for investigation so that the family and friends of Mr. Moynihan might see some closure to the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">During the hearing of the case the bouncer admitted that he received no training in security duties and that he did not know how to handle people, particularly in such extreme situations. There did not seem to be any training in health and safety matters such as for an evacuation if there was a difficulty with a fire or whatever in the club. Clearly that incident gives a graphic account of how a person who is not trained can be responsible for a fatal incident. It shows the need to ensure proper standards and regulations for the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">Thankfully, this type of incident is by no means common, but it raised in many people's minds the whole question of the controls and provisions which are in place to regulate the private security industry. Most people never have to cross swords with bouncers or security, but those who set out to deliberately create trouble or violence in a club or other venue need to be dealt with in a fair manner, without recourse to excessive violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">There is anecdotal evidence from many quarters that some security personnel are prone to over-step the mark and act in an overtly aggressive manner towards customers on a premises. Indeed, there have been numerous court cases in recent years involving assault of individuals by security personnel who over-stepped the mark in carrying out their duties. There is a sense among some security personnel that there are no limits to which they can go to deal with a chaotic or violent situation. Some door supervisors, in particular, do not deal with problems proportionately. I say "some" because, as with so many professions, a few have given everyone else a bad name.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">RTE's "Prime Time" programme recently screened an exposé on the private security industry. What was abundantly clear from that programme was the extraordinary lack of regulation and control in the sector and how easy it is for anyone to become a front line door supervisor, bouncer or other security person, even with little or no training or qualifications. It has been suggested that it would be quite easy for a convicted criminal just released from prison to join a private  security company. That revelation shows the true extent of this problem and proves how necessary is this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The whole area of recruitment and training in the estimated 400 private security firms in existence is at the heart of the problem we are considering and I am concerned that this is an issue not properly addressed in the Bill. Surely there should be some basic requirements and standards for the training and recruitment of security staff. There should be regulations governing the nature, extent and timescale of training. There should also be a strict set of guidelines to deal with the recruitment of security staff. How rigorous are the criteria for recruitment? Are size and strength the only requirements? There are no directions here regarding the authority. Surely brain is more important than brawn, even in the security business.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I hope the proposed private security authority will lay down comprehensive and stringent guidelines and standards for training, even though there is no direction in the Bill to that end, and that the authority will be given every resource necessary from Government to do so. There is little point in the Minister saying, as he did last night, that everyone in the industry should behave to a high standard unless there are guidelines and regulations to ensure this is the case and adequate penalties are in place to ensure that those who breach those guidelines are punished.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">As I said, one of the major flaws in the Bill is that it does not make a clear distinction between providers of security services and their employees. This results in it being confusing legislation. The legislation should deal with each separately and spell out the standards required in each case. Indeed, a cursory reading of the Bill and its headings would suggest that it deals only with employers who provide security services. Section 35, which is a small section, creates part of the confusion regarding how the Bill will operate. It states: "A person shall not employ a person to provide a security service if that person is required to, but does not, hold a licence to provide the service". It seems, according to that section, that not all providers of security services will need to hold a licence. Is that the case? This Bill should provide that all security service providers are licensed. There is something seriously wrong with the manner in which that is presented and the Minister needs to clarify it.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">In Part 3, section 21, on the licences to provide security services, which to my mind is the key section, there are very few requirements. It states that an application for a licence shall be accompanied by a fee and "such references as to the applicant's character, financial position and competence as the Authority may require", but later it states: "The Authority may require . . . "  The critical area here is section 21(3)(<i>c</i>), which states that the Authority may “require the applicant to supply a certificate by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent . . . ”. If one of the constituents of the  Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, applied before the general election to be entered on the supplementary register of electors, he or she would have had to go to the Garda station and get a special form signed by a Garda not below the rank of superintendent to identify him or her as the citizen concerned. If that is required in those circumstances, surely the least we should require here is a Garda certificate of fitness signed by a Garda not below the rank of superintendent for everybody working in this industry. The Minister cannot provide for less. This is the most sensitive area of business operations because it provides a security service.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The report of the consultative group readily acknowledged that criminal elements infiltrated the industry. Therefore unsavoury characters can quite easily become employees of security firms and there are many such employees at present because there are no standards or regulations and no licensing system. What is to stop unsavoury elements coming from central and eastern Europe who have been involved in the security forces in those countries. We know that some of them are in Ireland. Only a couple of weeks ago, the door supervisor for the well known night club, Lillies Bordello, was convicted of assault on a young husband and wife entering the club. It transpired that he had been a member of the special forces in one central European country which has been well noted for its unsavoury behaviour in terms of ethnic killing and so on. These are areas at which the Minister must look seriously. He should consider as a requirement a certificate of fitness from the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">I would like to refer to a number of other issues. The plan to be drawn up by the private security services authority is very important. An initial plan will be drawn up and revised for each subsequent three year period. The plan should be presented to the House for debate. The contents of the strategic plan will be all important and will include the criteria for licensing. How will the register operate? Will it be subject to freedom of information legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_375">How will the identity card system work? Someone who works in the security business should not merely carry a concealed identity card available only to a member of the Garda or a person in authority. Why should such a person not wear a badge at all times if he or she is to interface with the public? Private security personnel should wear an identifying mark rather than simply carry ID in their pockets which would not be available to the public on demand. A person could pretend to be a bouncer at a nightclub and behave like a heavy if he wanted to cause trouble. The legislation is wrong in not requiring visible identification for those in the security business, particularly those working as outdoor supervisors.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Training standards are important but the Bill is silent on this matter. It will be left to the private security authority to determine these standards. Who will deliver them? Is there a school of security services in existence? There is none to my  knowledge and the Minister has not referred to one. There are now approximately 12,000 security people in the open economy who, apart from some informal training, are all untrained. Surely we need a school to provide the training services required by this legislation. We need a clear statement of what those standards will be. Will the training standards for the businesses who are the providers of security services differ from those required of employees who will be the frontline people dealing with the public? Surely there is a huge psychological aspect to training. We do not want people for whom brawn is everything. People can be attracted to this industry because they are heavies and enjoy the power it gives them. We must identify the training standards required.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">How will the complaints mechanism operate? This is dealt with to some extent by the Bill. How will the inspectors operate? How many inspectors will be employed and what resources will be given to that sector? If legislation is not adequately enforced we might as well not enact it.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The Minister must give the House a commitment that when the strategic plan is put together by the authority it will be brought to the House for debate. The plan will be the template for the regulation, operation, licensing and control of the security industry in the future. We should get things right as soon as possible and from the very beginning.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Because the security industry is not regulated we do not know the extent of the black economy in the industry. However, we know it is huge. We also know that there is very low pay, low standards, long hours and exploitation in the sector. This aspect of the industry must be examined. Every proper company involved in the security industry wants to see it regulated and operated properly but we must come to grips with the section of the industry which operates in the black economy and ensure that the elements which are giving the entire industry a bad name are rooted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The role of members of the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service presents a serious question. Anecdotal evidence suggests that large numbers of these forces moonlight in the private security services, particularly as doormen and bouncers. The Garda Commissioner has requested that members of the Garda voluntarily inform him of their intention to moonlight outside their normal work. I would love to know how many gardaí have volunteered that information to the Commissioner. I would speculate that they could be counted on the fingers of my two hands. I would be surprised to hear that the Commissioner has a massive database of gardaí who are working in the private security industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Is this a proper function for members of the security forces? What should we do about it? Will members of the security forces be regulated by this legislation? Will they be licensed and carry identity cards? The Minister should give this mat ter some thought before he brings the Bill back to the House for its next Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">I hope the Revenue Commissioners will turn their attention to this sector once it is regulated. I know many people working in this sector who are poorly paid. Surely it is time those working in the security business had trade union regulation if they request it. The Bill should state that security providers or employees of security providers may join the trade union of their choice. We should encourage citizens to organise collectively in relation to pay and conditions of work. The Minister should reflect on this before the Bill returns to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">I welcome the Bill although had I been drafting it I would have done so differently from the Minister. The Bill should state more clearly what it is intended to do. It should make a clear distinction between security firms who are employers and individual security providers. Because the Bill does not do this it will be difficult to impose the different standards required on those who will be licensed as employers and those who will be licensed as front line people delivering the service. We look forward to the opportunity of teasing it out and looking at the individual sections of the Bill. The Bill is very necessary and it will be in the interests of the industry and the public.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_386">I welcome the introduction of this Bill and I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak on it today. I compliment the Minister on his initiative in introducing the Bill because it deals with an aspect of Irish life that has been allowed to operate without any control, regulation or sanction for far too long. For a long time, there have been demands for the introduction of controls in the security industry, but to the shame of all those with responsibility for this matter, nothing was done.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The Bill deals with the entire private security industry, including suppliers and installers of security equipment, private investigators, private security employers, security guards, door supervisors, etc. "Door supervisor" is the fashionable term for the old-fashioned term "bouncer". I will address this area this afternoon. In many cases, the criterion for the selection of door supervisors or bouncers was: "The bigger the bruiser, the better". That description underlines the urgent need for control in this area. I have witnessed people operating as bouncers who were totally unsuited to the job. This is for many reasons, not least because of their inability to communicate in a reasonable manner, but also, in many cases, because of their seedy backgrounds and general violent behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">We have had many high-profile cases where the actions of bouncers have had devastating, tragic results, sometimes leading to loss of life. Those cases are the ones highlighted by the media, but there are other incidents occurring on a nightly basis where young people in particular are treated in an appalling way by bouncers.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The very fact that young people go out to socialise means that, after a night's entertainment, they may be in high spirits. Therefore, it is essential that people dealing with such matters be trained to relate to people and not just rely on the old thinking that people in high spirits have to be taught a lesson, and then administer that lesson by brute force.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">We have had cases of young people disappearing late at night, sometimes after being ejected from discos and nightclubs. The ejection may have occurred because they consumed too much drink, or they may have consumed some other substance, in many cases without having realised that they consumed the substance. The method of dealing with such circumstances is to throw such people out on to the public footpath and abandon them in their deranged state. Then they have to survive amidst all the dangers inherent in our society, which are undoubtedly amplified in the early hours of the morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">We cannot lose sight of the fact that alcohol has been consumed on the premises – the evidence would support this – but there is no sanction for the proprietor who has served the young people with too much alcohol. Their solution is to employ a big brute to teach the young people a lesson.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I regret that placing responsibility in this regard is not dealt with in this Bill and I ask the Minister to give some consideration to this issue. I know the principal purpose of the Private Security Authority, which is to be set up under this Bill, will be, amongst other things, to operate a licensing system for providers of security services. However, it does not refer to the necessity to develop a code of practice for the industry and this is a deficiency that needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Section 2 deals with the membership of the Private Security Authority. The membership of the authority includes a barrister or solicitor, representatives of security employers and employees, a nominee of the Garda Commissioner and staff representatives, but I regard the composition of the authority to be deficient because there is no specific stipulation that young people be represented on it. This is a very serious omission because bouncers deal mostly with young people. Therefore, the people at the coalface, i.e. the young people, should be represented on this authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The Bill provides for the issuing of identity cards to licence holders and requires the licensees to have the identity cards in their possession and to produce them on request to a Garda, a member of staff of the authority or a person for whom the licensee provides security services. That is not good enough because the licensee should be  required to wear an identity tag so he can be identified at all times when providing security services, just as members of An Garda Síochána have to wear an identity number when on duty. Otherwise, how could a member of the public who has a complaint against a bouncer identify that bouncer?</p>
          <p eId="para_395">Because of the element of riff-raff and people of bad character who work as bouncers at the moment – I am not saying that all bouncers are people of bad character, but there are many blackguards in the industry – it should be compulsory for people seeking a licence to have Garda clearance. Section 31 says that the authority "may" request the Garda to provide information on an applicant for a licence, but that is not strong enough. It should be compulsory that Garda clearance be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The private security industry and particularly bouncers, or door supervisors as they are now called, have much to do to gain the respect of the public. Their behaviour down the years has been totally unacceptable. People were subjected to physical abuse and often ejected from premises for no good reason or ejected at two or three in the morning without the opportunity to bring with them their personal effects such as clothes, coats or money and left on their own, often with tragic consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">This Bill will go a long way towards ensuring that the public is protected and will help to impose a certain respectability on the private security industry. Again, I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill because it is so badly needed to regulate the industry. The industry was crying out for regulation and it is certainly a poor reflection on previous Governments that they allowed the situation to continue unchecked. I have no doubt that lives could have been saved if action had been taken earlier, and the trauma experienced by many people at the hands of bouncers could have been avoided.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">Ba mhaith liom ar dtús a lua go bhfuil spéis ar leith agam san ábhar seo mar tá deartháir agam a chuireann córas rabhaidh ar fáil. Tá comhlucht dá chuid féin aige. Ba mhaith liom a rá go dtacaím go hiomlán leis an mbogadh seo chun go mbeadh reachtaíocht éigin ann chun na comhlachtaí agus na daoine atá ag obair ar dhóirsí mar bouncers a eagrú i gceart agus chun go mbeadh ceadúnais agus traeneáil ceart acu. Tacaímid go hiomlán leis an bhogadh seo sa dóigh is go mbeidh na comhlachtaí seo agus daoine ag obair ar dhoirse faoi reachtaíocht éigin agus go mbeidh siad eagraithe le ceadúnais agus go traenáil acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Regulation is important if it is well handled, especially in a sensitive sector such as this, and can be positive for the industry, the consumer and society. We are pleased this industry is to be regulated. It is a rare occurrence and we wish to see it happen in other areas. We would all like to see a situation where private security companies are  adequately licensed, scrutinised and called to account for mismanagement or abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Ba cheart go mbeadh foirne na gcomhlachtaí seo traenáilte i gceart, go mbeidís rialaithe agus go mbeidís i gceardchumann. Ba mhaith linn go mbeadh an módh oibre seo bunaithe ar an chleachtadh is fearr, cibé run a dhéanann siad, go mbeadh caighdeán leagtha síos maidir leis an méid nirt a bhaintear úsáid as nuair is gá, go mbeadh caighdeán cearta daoine leagtha síos d'achan duine sa tseirbhís agus go mbeadh a fhios acu ar fad na dualgais atá acu maidir leis an dhlí, go háirithe an t-Acht Stadas Cothroma.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">We want to ensure that security companies and their employees maintain a positive relationship with their communities and the Garda Síochána. This legislation has the potential to ensure that this sector has a positive role to play. We welcome the proposed creation of a private security authority in that it should strengthen the accountability of service providers and prevent abuses. Such accountability and good practice is fundamental, regardless of whether the security providers are from the Garda Síochána, the military or the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Tacaímid leis na príomhchodanna den Bhille – ag cruthú údaráis slándála príobhaideacha, córas ceadúnais agus córas comhfhiosrú a dhéanamh, cinnithe a ghlacadh maidir le gearáin agus bórd athamharc le féachaint ar chásanna a rachfadh go hathamharc. Fáiltímid roimh moltaí go socrófar caighdéan traenála mar caithfidh traenáil bheith tugtha d'achan duine ag obair sa tseirbhís seo agus go mbeadh caighdeán difriúl ar fáil do dhaoine difriúla sna gnéithe difriúla den obair seo. Ní gá go dtabharfaí traenáil iomlán do dhuine atá ag obair ar shuíomh tógála i gcomparáid le duine ag obair ar dhoras. Caithfidh go dtabharfaí cáighdeán difriúl traenála do dhuine atá ar lorg oibre ar dhoras nó ag tabhairt slándála príobhaideacha do dhaoine.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">We believe it would be of benefit if the membership of the proposed authority was to be diversified. At present it is proposed that membership will be drawn from representatives of the industry and the Garda Síochána. However, there is no provision for representation from the unions, civil and human rights activists or advocates or the communities which are directly affected by private security service. This should be addressed on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">When the authority is established it must ensure that all licensed companies and individuals act in conformity with human rights standards. The right to privacy must be understood and adhered to and there must be full compliance with all related legislation in this area. Given Ireland's diversity and the danger that prejudice could have a negative impact on decision making, resulting in unnecessary cases being brought before the Equality Authority, all licensees should be required to be thoroughly trained in equality issues and be aware of their obligations under the Equal Status Act. This applies to both employers and employees in the industry. This is  anti-racism in the workplace week and I hope that when the legislation is enacted it will be a vehicle for change in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">In the interests of fairness and transparency the licensing criteria set out in sections 21 and 22 must be specified and clarified by the authority and made specific to the various sub-sectors in the industry. Sinn Féin wants to ensure that workers in this sector have good working conditions and the ability to be unionised. Ultimately, we wish to see the sector fully unionised.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Sinn Féin also wishes to ensure that the complaints mechanism outlined in section 36 has adequate teeth. Its powers are not fully clear. We wish to ensure that an annual report is published to monitor the trends in the various sub-sectors of the industry and to list how many people are involved in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">I agree with Deputy Costello that there is a need to tackle moonlighting by members of the Garda Síochána. That aspect must be fully regulated and a directive should be issued that gardaí do no engage in this type of work. They cannot have it both ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">We support this legislation. However, there is concern that its provisions and future regulation may lead to the inevitable privatisation of security in this State, leading to the greater deployment of private security in support of civil authorities. This is especially so given the state of the public finances and the widespread recognition that the current deployment of the Garda Síochána is hardly adequate to meet public needs. In most of the area I represent the Garda presence is totally inadequate. Some stations appear to be operative on a part-time basis despite the rise in crime in their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">While Garda resources are inadequate, I hope that will not lead some to call for the privatisation of security in the State. We should not contemplate this. Privatised security and the privatisation of policing and prison services in other countries, such as Africa, Latin America and Australia, or even the United States, has had consequences in terms of serious human rights violations, sub-standard conditions and, in many cases, deaths. Some will argue that regulation in advance of privatisation would address these aspects, but the evidence of this is conflicting.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">While I fully support the Bill I ask the Minister to address my concerns. I hope in the future there will be no deaths related to this sector or to the activities of those involved in night work. I also hope that cases against security staff are dealt with as quickly as possible and that those in the industry charged with human rights abuses or assaults are no longer allowed to work at the doors of night clubs or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">This happened in a recent high profile case in Dublin where a couple managed to win an award against Lillies Bordello because of the activities of one of the bouncers. That same bouncer assaulted my own brother and has another charge pending, which means he was left in a position  to assault others while prior assault charges were made against him. It is not acceptable that people are allowed to continue in security work where they have been charged in regard to assaults while on door security.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_412">The Green Party welcomes the publication of the Bill. I compliment a previous Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, who commissioned the report by the consultative group on the private security industry back in 1997. That was a very impressive report.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">There have been a number of disquieting incidents in regard to so-called bouncers at entertainment venues using excessive force resulting in young people getting injured. Quite apart from the use of force, the attitude of security staff has left something to be desired in recent years. The report highlighted mismanagement and bad working conditions among security firms but on a far more sinister note it also implied that there was paramilitary and criminal involvement within the industry and for that reason alone, if not for any of the others, there is a need for action.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The Bill does not go far enough. We are concerned about the potential exemptions in section 3. I am not a parliamentary draftsman but there appears to be a possible ambiguity in section 3(<i>f</i>) which makes me worry that not all members of security firms would have to register with the new authority being created. As the Member from Sinn Féin pointed out, it is crucial that we know who is working in the sector. There have been many reports of double jobbing in the industry by members of the Garda Síochána and if we could wipe that out we could create much needed employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">There is one very simple change that is needed in the legislation in regard to identification of security firm staff. From the experience of colleagues and friends in Australia, I have some knowledge of how the industry is carried out there. In Australia any security worker who is in the public domain has to have a clearly identifiable number on his or her front and back, almost akin to having a number plate on a car, but in letters, perhaps eight inches high. This would ensure that when an incident of aggression occurred at a nightclub door or other premises, the public would clearly know who was involved. We need to go far beyond section 27 which refers only to the carrying of identification cards. I know personally of many cases where problems have arisen due to the difficulty in identifying which member of a security firm was involved. In the same way that the Garda Síochána carry, or are supposed to carry, their identification number on their epaulettes, security firms should carry much larger numbers on their uniform that are clearly visible to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">There is a strong need for training in this area. I compliment the Garda Síochána for the assistance it provided in this regard to private security firms in Cork city. I am not sure how formalised the training was but there are reports that it was  carried out by the Garda in regard to security duties. We could take that a bit further and have a minimum standard of training for people who are actively engaged with the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">With regard to the exemptions in Part III, I believe that any member of the Garda should be clearly identified whether on or off duty. We have to ensure that double jobbing does not happen. There is also exemption for apprentices and that is a potential loophole in the law. I suggest we put a three week time limit on the training of apprentices to ensure we do not have security firms with a large number of apprentices still on their books many years after they are recruited.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Identification numbers would be a relatively simple change and we could look at the Road Traffic Acts to see how to go about that. Security people should be clearly identified and the exemptions should be a lot narrower to ensure the public know who is involved in a security service. We have to clean up the industry both at a management level but also at a more sinister level where there is evidence of the involvement of paramilitary or criminal organisations. This Bill has merit and I am glad the Government is putting it forward. I hope we can make suitable detailed amendments to it at a later stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_419">I too welcome the Bill. Often legislation is prepared simply because a new Minister arrives in a Department and we end up being over regulated with layer upon layer of legislation. In this instance I deem the Bill to be very necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">It is not long since I was face to face with the doormen of Dublin, which I found a daunting prospect. I am sure this Bill will be a positive development for security on our streets. In Dún Laoghaire we have a problem on Marine Road and rumours abound about the nature of the goings on there.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Much of the debate up to now focused on doormen but the Bill deals with other areas such as private investigators, which is also commendable. This area has been broadly ignored but it is a growing industry and a very useful one in terms of protecting us against fraudulent claims. Private investigators have managed to undo some of the most complex webs of deceitful claims brought before the courts and are to be commended for it. At the same time, regulation is necessary because we are dealing with an area that is sensitive for reasons of civil liberties, apart from anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">To its credit, Fine Gael introduced a Private Members Bill on this area before. Much of the criticism today has focused on the delay in bringing the Bill forward as the report was produced in 1997 or 1998. It is a very sensitive area and one that should be addressed correctly and properly. Hopefully that will occur on Committee Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_204">
          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_424">I intend to share with Deputy Glennon. With respect to the contents of the Bill we have many cases in the courts regarding private security firms. Where a criminal case is involved concerning the circumstances covered by the Bill it should be open to a judge to seek the authorities' opinion on a private security firm much like a trial judge might seek a probation report from the probation service. Equally it should be open to a trial judge to ask the authorities for an opinion on private investigators or private security firms to help him or her make up his or her mind about the standing of that firm and previous complaints against it etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">When proposing the legislation the Minister indicated that it was on foot of much technological progress that has taken place in this area. I have come across a number of nightclubs that have CCTV installed at their entrances. When one is aware that CCTV is in operation at the entrance it can have a sobering effect on one's behaviour. We need to allow the authority and the private security appeal board to attach conditions to licences. I am not sure if that is envisaged in the Bill. For example, a private security firm would need to have CCTV in order to ensure that it carries out its work in a safe manner. That is something that should be considered in the operation of the private security appeal board.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">If the licence is taken from a private security firm we should consider if it can be reissued. A PSV licence is withdrawn from an individual for three years if he or she is convicted of a road traffic offence. Perhaps the Minister will clarify if a private security firm can apply for a reissue of a licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Section 21 deals with evidence of character and is the most important part of the Bill. It calls upon the authority to make these investigations. I would query, if not object to, the reference to the financial position of an applicant. What circumstances would require the Minister to investigate the financial position of an applicant? If this provision is intended to ensure a person is tax compliant it should be spelled out more clearly. I cannot foresee a circumstance where someone's financial position should be examined by the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Section 32 envisages an ongoing investigation by the authority whereby a licensee is obliged to provide evidence of his or her licence on inspection by the authority or the Garda Síochána. That is to be welcomed. What steps are taken if somebody is unable to produce the licence on request? Is the premises closed down or is the security firm required to cease operation? Is the premises expected to carry on business without security?</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I echo the comments made by other Deputies regarding training. Any applicant should be versed with provisions of the Equal Status Act, 2000, as it applies to those against whom discrimination is prohibited. They should also be versed in Garda powers. In many cases these men are large – like Deputy Glennon who is looking at  me – and many of them would benefit from some training in controlling their brute strength.</p>

I pay tribute to her and know this was an issue of major concern to her.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I congratulate the different interested parties that have been involved in bringing the Bill to this stage. The professional and trade organisations involved in the security industry have taken a major interest in having the matter brought this far. I look forward to their continued co-operation and persistence, not only in bringing matters to a conclusion, but in taking a full part in the authority when it is formed. While there is a provision in the Bill for a role for employers and employees, I believe the professional associations are the ground-level experts and should have a major voice in the authority. Another contributor said that there was no allowance made for trade union involvement. There is provision in the Bill for employee involvement.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">The Bill is timely. It is important that the media-friendly issue of doormen and bouncers is not allowed to dominate the debate. This Bill is broad in its scope covering the gamut of the security industry. It covers everything from bouncers to armoured cars. While the media has a particular interest in the aspects of the Bill that relate to doormen – a lot of attention has been given to that already – it is not appropriate that that aspect should be allowed dominate. The security industry is huge. The 400 active companies employ around 22,000 people. Those are important figures which should be borne in mind throughout the debate. The men and women on the doors of establishments that my younger colleagues frequent to a greater degree than me capture the attention, but the issue should not be allowed to dominate.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">It is important that the new authority will not only operate a licensing system and provide a register of licence providers, but that it will also  set training standards. Reference has been made to the importance of this aspect of the work of the new authority. I am aware that some of the professional associations in the industry are working with FÁS in this regard. That is an area that will be of crucial importance in the implementation of the Bill. The Bill's provisions in this area have received maximum attention in the debate as a result of recent bad publicity and the experience of younger Members of this aspect of private security services.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I am aware of a case involving a doorman who was in fancy dress while working at a club on a theme night. He was unidentifiable to the patrons who were trying to gain access. This was a high profile case that went to court and it cost the would-be patron. The case involved mistaken identity which arose because the individual fulfilling the role of doorman was attired as a Bedouin sheikh. That is utterly unacceptable and this issue should be brought to the attention of the new authority. The patron became involved in an altercation as a result of this mistaken identity and it cost him dearly both financially and in terms of reputation. I look forward to the day when such an occurrence will not be possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Deputy Cuffe stated there should be a requirement on security men in dance clubs to be adequately identifiable. That is not practical as a vitally important part of a security service is the undercover nature of a substantial portion of its work. It would be extremely difficult to implement appropriate security if every member of the security staff at a venue was clearly identifiable to patrons.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">I am proud I am the son of a publican. Both my grandfathers were publicans and a number of my uncles on both sides of my family were publicans. The sections of the legislation dealing with licensed premises are of particular interest to me, particularly the role of such premises in our culture and their evolution from old family-run pubs to the current fad for super pubs. I grew up in a small family-run pub and at that time the role of licensee as owner-barman was important. There was no need for bouncers in those days. The owner-licensee decided when the patron had had enough and, invariably, the patron respected his view.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">However, as we have entered the era of the super pub, licensed premises are suffering from a lack of staff supervision and training and a lack of experienced staff. The vast majority of staff in the larger pubs are students who do a few nights work to earn a few euro to put themselves through college. There is a distinct absence of hands-on management. The standards that applied decades ago have vanished in super pubs and can only be experienced in the relatively small number of owner-run pubs that remain. The super pub phenomenon is not a matter directly related to the legislation but it is an issue that must be addressed. Consideration should be given to the size of an area licensed to sell intoxicating liquor but that is an issue for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Deputy McHugh referred in his contribution to the difficulties relating to public disorder at certain times of the night as people emerge from licensed premises. This reminded me of a legal precedent which states that where something escapes from one property to another and causes damage to the latter property, the owner of the property from which it escaped is liable for the damage. Could that precedent be applied to public order offences involving patrons emerging from licensed premises? This relates to my earlier point regarding the standards applied in owner-run pubs and those being observed by the owners of super pubs. It is a moot point as to whether they apply standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Deputy Deasy referred to the possibility of providing for parental responsibility for the acts of individuals emerging from pubs. In theory, to enter a licensed premises and consume intoxicating liquor one must be an adult legally, that is, over 18 years. It would be almost impossible under the terms of the Constitution to apply parental responsibility for the acts of other adults, some of whom may well be parents themselves. I do not know whether that is practical. Publicans must take greater responsibility for the premises they run. Their level of responsibility has reduced dramatically and it is something to which we must revert.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I thank Deputy Andrews for sharing time and I commend the Bill. I look forward very much to the implementation of the legislation and the continued participation of the professional bodies involved in the industry in the smooth implementation of the legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_210">
          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_444">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation. I congratulate the previous speaker on his maiden contribution and I thank him for the recognition he gave to the former Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, who was responsible for putting a consultative group in place to address this issue in 1997. It is regrettable it has taken so long to introduce this legislation. A consultative group was set up to discuss this issue and former Deputy, John Farrelly, introduced a Private Members' Bill relating to this issue two years ago. The private security industry as a whole has sought such regulation for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I welcome the debate and look forward to the passage of the legislation. However, it is has taken too long for the Government to prioritise this issue. I hope this is an indication of the priorities of the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to the security of young people, in particular, at night on the streets of our towns and cities. It gives me no pleasure to say that the record of the former Minister left a lot to be desired.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The purpose of the Bill is to establish a private security authority to control and supervise firms providing security, a welcome development. It will also establish a publicly accessible register of licence holders and provide for the issuing of  identity cards to licensees and for the setting of standards for training. These are immensely important provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I am afraid I am as guilty as other speakers who focused their attention on bouncers and security personnel at nightclubs and pubs. However, I have good reason to focus on that area. Unfortunately, there have been many instances of bouncers, door men or security personnel abusing their powers. Yet sanctions have not been imposed on people or companies for what they have done. I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, knows about the tragic case in Cork in recent years where a young man was killed after being dragged into a nightclub and severely manhandled. I must be careful about what I say on that matter. However, the clear evidence from the video tapes is that the young man was dealt with in an overly harsh way with tragic consequences. My colleague, Deputy Allen, has attempted to prioritise this case on many occasions in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">There have also been cases outside Cork. I remember being shocked to hear on the radio the story of a man who was beaten up on Grafton Street outside a well known nightclub. When he asked why he and his wife were refused entry to the nightclub, he was beaten so badly he required hospitalisation. That is not acceptable in a civilised society which is supposed to be based on law and order and to have a Constitution which protects all its citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The provision of security personnel identity cards will be a major positive step. Once people realise they can be identified by a security card number and that a complaint can be made against them, they will think before they act. Unfortunately, in some cases the thought process comes after the physical punishment has been dished out. I accept that the job of a security person or doorman is difficult and is becoming more challenging every year. However, that is not an excuse to over-react in a non-professional way by giving a young person, who may be under the influence of alcohol, a severe beating which can sometimes lead to tragic consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I welcome the fact that a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints against licensees will also be established. I am glad the Bill is providing for a system whereby a member of the public who feels they have been unfairly treated will be able to make a complaint. That complaint should be treated in a professional manner and the response should be given in a reasonable amount of time. The authority should investigate the matter and ensure fair and due process for both the licensee and the member of the public who made the complaint. I also welcome the provision in the Bill to establish an appeals board. If members of the public feel they have not been fairly treated by the authority they can appeal to the appeals board and, if necessary, go to the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">I hope the authority will be run independently of the individual companies concerned. I also hope there will not be a close link between the authority which gives out licences and the security firms. I would not like to see the establishment of a system, such as the Garda Complaints Board where gardaí investigated other gardaí. That puts the people under investigation and those investigating in an awkward and unfair position. The authority must be totally independent of the industry, although it will be the regulatory body.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The Bill gives effect to the principle and recommendations contained in the report of the consultative group on the private security industry which was published in 1997. That group was set up by the former Minister for Justice, Nora Owen. Unfortunately, she did not have time to give effect to those recommendations in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">I welcome the establishment of the complaints authority which members of the public are anxious to see in operation. The only course of action a member of the public can take when trying to seek redress for unfair treatment is to go to the gardaí or to the Ombudsman. Either avenue is not acceptable at present. Many cases are drawn out because the Ombudsman must make a judgment call between the word of a bouncer and that of a member of the public, which is not entirely satisfactory. That is why I welcome the fact the authority can either revoke or suspend a licence or warn a company if a minor offence is committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I am happy about the inclusion of a number of sections. Section 9 provides for the preparation of a strategic plan by the authority to set out targets and guidelines for a three year period. I was pleased that was included because there was a danger we would try to establish an authority as a knee-jerk reaction to some of the tragedies which have occurred on the streets of Cork, Dublin or Limerick. The recommendation that we must constantly plan and set ourselves targets into the future came from the consultative body. I hope that when the strategic plan is made available the House will have an opportunity to debate it and the Minister will have an input. If we, as policy makers and legislators, have a problem with it, we will have an opportunity to voice our concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Section 15, which requires the authority to report to the Minister on a regular basis, is linked to the issue of consultation. In general, where such authorities are established, I do not favour regular ministerial intervention or significant ministerial influence. In this case, however, it is important that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has responsibility for the security of the nation, is given the opportunity to consult members of the authority on a regular basis to ensure they respond to Government policy as it is adapted to meet the changing demands of society. For this reason I welcome the requirement of the authority to report to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I also welcome section 14, which provides inspectors with the necessary powers to enforce the regulations and monitoring of the authority. It would be unacceptable for the proprietors of pubs, nightclubs, shops or any other facility to refuse entry to an inspector who is enforcing the rules laid down by the authority. I, therefore, welcome the decision to make non-compliance with the request of an inspector a punishable offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">It would not be possible to discuss private security services without alluding to the increased levels of street violence and violent crime in general. Bouncers, security personnel and doormen – I use all three titles as one's choice depends on where one is from – work in a changing environment. As such, the legislation is as important for the security industry and, in some ways, for the security of doormen as it is for members of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I remind the House of the environment in which we now live. All sources, whether the Garda Review, Victim Support, taxi drivers or accident and emergency services, regularly remind public representatives that we live in a more violent society. It came as no surprise to read recently that Limerick General Hospital had requested a Garda presence in its accident and emergency department at weekends. Such requests give us an idea of the problems many security personnel have to deal with in pubs, night clubs and other locations where people gather socially or to purchase goods.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">We held a conference in Cork last year entitled Demanding Safer Streets, at which one of the speakers, a doctor from the accident and emergency department of a Cork hospital, outlined the significant increase in the number of people he sees and treats as a result of assaults on the streets. The largest group of people attending accident and emergency departments at weekends are victims of street assaults. An officer from Victim Support reminded the conference that in addition to the rise in the number of assaults, their viciousness had also increased. This, too, must be reflected in the formulation of policy on private security services and in the training provided for personnel working in that sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Another speaker at the event, Mr. Pat Delaney of the Small Firms Association, highlighted that more than half the small businesses he represents had been victims of crime in the past 12 months, an increase of 19% on the previous year. From memory, I recall that small firms are spending almost £500 million a year on security in the form of personnel, cameras, double-glazed glass, extra door locks, window grills and similar items. It is sad, but unfortunately true, that we are moving in this direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">In a further reminder of the problem we face, Garda statistics issued last year, unfortunately well out of date, showed an increase in violent crimes of 131%. As a result of violent attacks in our towns and cities last year, more than 3,500  persons were hospitalised and required in-patient care, in other words an extended stay in hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Unfortunately, we live in a violent society in which a new fear factor has emerged among parents and young people. I come from a big family and have a younger brother aged 18 years who frequently tells me I am not up to speed on these issues. Many people of his age group do not go into the city centre.</p>

          <p eId="para_468">Many 18 year olds, such as my brother who is 6 ft. 3 ins. and weighs 15 stone, are choosing not to go into the city centre at night because of fear and security concerns. They now go to local pubs and night clubs. We need to reflect these concerns in legislation. A combination of changes in Garda deployment, legislation on the private security industry and the provision of tools, such as CCTV and proper equipment and training, would enable the Garda and security personnel to provide a decent level of supervision and security for young and not so young people to go out at night without fear.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">We need to get away from the image that bouncers need to be tough guys and must be big, burly, strong and intimidating in order that people do not mess with them. Bouncers should defuse problems, not cause them. There should be more female security personnel in pubs and night clubs, particularly at night. At least half their patrons are female, yet male bouncers and doormen do not generally receive adequate training in how to deal with the many young girls out enjoying themselves at weekends. We must concentrate on enforcing the rules to ensure we have a safer environment for our young people.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">Although it seems a long time since this Dáil first sat on 6 June, I have not had the opportunity to speak in the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern.

Deputy Andrews referred to nightclubs as did Deputy  Coveney, but I am of an age group that is not that used to going to such clubs and it is not something I have done all that often.

          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_474">I remember a little while ago going to a nightclub in Tallaght and as I was going in the doorman asked, "You are not really going down there Charlie, are you?" before offering to get me a cup of tea. It is a different scene but I hear many people talking about it. Many of my constituents who come to the seven clinics I do during the week and to my full-time office in Tallaght tell me of the fears they have, not only about going out, but as Deputy Coveney has said, about sending their young people out and wondering what state they will return in, or if they will return in one piece.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">All speakers have emphasised the bouncer element and I refer to it also, but we should not forget that there is another side to that. Many of my constituents who have been employed in security jobs in various institutions and venues tell me it is becoming more difficult to live locally and be seen by the people they have to deal with. I often say that politicians living communities do not get hassle but I understand what these people are saying. I hope security staff understand that their ethos should be to protect the public, but if by preventing people from stealing and abusing passers-by they are intimidated in turn and have people calling to their houses to tell them they must move on, there is something wrong. My town is no different to anywhere else in that regard, but those things happen and in looking at the points being made in this debate we should remember that there is also that perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I do not want to talk exclusively about my town, but it is relevant to say that it is quite different to many in the country. Even though Tallaght is our third largest population centre, there are only, if that is the right way to express it, nine pubs and two hotels. On many rural village streets you will find that many pubs and I was fascinated recently on visiting a town in a southern county to walk up and down a street counting the number of pubs. I suspect that Members on all sides of the House have different views and perspectives on this subject, which is fair enough, and in the short space of time I have been here I have been interested to listen to what my colleagues say. We do not all do that as there are many other demands on our time, but it is important to realise that there are people of all ages and backgrounds in the Dáil and it is good to share this information.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Like all Members, I receive many representations from constituents who have had difficulties with door security personnel outside public  houses, nightclubs and, in a new phenomenon, fast-food restaurants. I suspect that happens in a lot of constituencies and I am interested in hearing what other Deputies have to say on the matter. I am disappointed, as are many other Members, that our society has become so tense that door security has become an essential part of the night out. In my inaugural speech to the House, I spoke on the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill which I welcomed as part of the comprehensive tightening of the law to provide maximum protection to the public we serve. I realise that the entire private security industry is covered in the legislation before the House, but I wish to concentrate on door security services, as have other speakers. Over the years as the need for this service has, regrettably, increased, the high profile of serious breaches of the law by bouncers – if I can use that word – has left the public with a suspicious view of their ability to do their job. While the feeling abroad that door security is arrogant and aggressive is denied by the industry, that image is unfortunately all too real and visible. Deputy Coveney underscored that graphically and I have seen the video footage from Cork which he referred to quite a bit on television. It upsets and saddens and I am glad that he and other Members have brought it to the attention of the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I welcome the fact that the private security authority will licence all members of the industry both as operating companies and as individuals. In addition, the staff employed by companies or individuals will require a licence. The condition that the licensee must be "a fit person" as defined by the authority will need to be strict and transparent and while I do not want to see anyone deprived of an honest living, I realise that there are people engaged in door security who are not suited to this customer service position. As such, they should not be acceptable or accommodated in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">I serve in a constituency, as do other colleagues, where one knows that people engaged in security work have other lives and activities and come from what I describe delicately as "political interests". I do not want to upset Members who are not in the Chamber, but that is the case in my constituency. The requirement of all private security service staff to carry at all times their licences, which I assume will be in the form of an ID card, will give the public further confidence that they are being protected by suitable persons and will allow the Garda to make checks if problems arise. The fact that it will be illegal for a business to hire or engage a person to carry out door duties who is not a licence holder will mean that responsibility will be jointly held by the owner and the individual. In the past, business owners have disavowed knowledge as justification when a problem has occurred, but this Bill will put an end to that practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I welcome the fair way in which the Bill proposes to deal with complaints. I accept that nuis ance complaints can become an issue where right of entry is involved and I expect the speed with which the authority responds and investigates to reduce their frequency. The advice and caution options to which the authority has recourse in the event of a complaint being upheld are too weak and the authority should issue a warning as its first response. The appeals process will allow natural justice to take its course and I welcome the provisions of the Bill in this regard. The technical supports provided to the authority are also welcome as is the Strategic Management Initiative requirement to produce a strategy statement, which I look forward to reading when it is placed before the House. With regard to the authority's membership and its day-to-day activities, the Minister and his officials have struck a good balance. I support the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">While I have concentrated on the door security services provisions of the Bill, as a newly elected Deputy for Dublin South West, I also welcome the other provisions which deal with the installers of security equipment, private investigators, private security employers, security guards, security consultants, locksmiths, armoured car services and safe installers.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, reminds me that he helped to get me here, if I can say that while there are very few in the House. I ask Deputy English not to tell anyone that. I am always happy to be in the presence of the Minister of State because he looked after me well when he was chairman of the health board in recent years.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_484">The focus of this debate, the publicity attaching to it and to this Bill has rightly dealt with the issues of concern to us. I support Deputy Coveney's point about the public's image of bouncers. We should not forget the other side of the coin. The public gather in many public places, for example, in Tallaght they gather at health board centres, doctors' surgeries, The Square, the hospital, the council buildings and other buildings one would expect to see in a major town. It is regrettable that there is an increasing need on a daily, and certainly on a nightly, basis to have security personnel in place in such buildings. If one were to go to Tallaght hospital late at night – the position is no different from that in a hospital in Cork, Meath or elsewhere – one would be struck by the number of security personnel patrolling the accident and emergency department and the grounds. There must be an emphasis on security in the other public buildings I mentioned, including The Square, which is a large shopping centre that attracts millions of people a year. Security personnel, no more than many other people who work in the public domain, are often the subject of abuse and intimidation.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Prior to having the privilege of being elected to the Dáil, I spent a good deal of my time as a member of South Dublin County Council, formerly Dublin County Council, working with families who because of the nature of the job in which a member of their family was engaged – I am specifically talking about security personnel – found themselves under threat. Given the emphasis in the Bill on bouncers and what they should be doing, which is hitting the headlines, we should also be aware of the other side of the coin. We should not be afraid to say to those people who provide an honest, decent security service that they have our support. We want the security industry to do the job right and the majority of people who work in it want to do that. However, we must understand that they also have needs. We must ensure the rights of security personnel in, for example, The Square or Tallaght hospital, caretakers or those looking after people in health centres are protected. I am speaking about places in Tallaght but the same holds true for premises elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">I enjoyed listening to the debate and congratulate my colleagues who contributed to it. It is a subject about which we are all interested and concerned. I ask the Minister of State to impress on the Minister the need to deal with this legislation and to listen to what is being said. I hope this Bill will be passed and will become law as quickly as possible so that we address the image of the industry and the other issues of concern to many of us. I hope the Minister will take on board the recommendations that come forward from this debate. I look forward to the Bill being enacted. I thank the Chair for allowing me to speak on the debate. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_494">While we can joke, this is a serious issue. This Bill addresses only the tip of the iceberg. I read in the <i>News of the World</i> recently that the Minister of State for Justice, Deputy O'Dea, said he is afraid to walk the streets of Limerick. He has a nice fancy car and a garda assigned to him at all times. We talk about the loss of control, that is admitting we have lost control. If the Minister of State feels like that, what hope have I, my mother or any of the rest of us of feeling safe on our streets? This is serious. Crime has taken over.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">I thank John Farrelly for his work in this area. It is regrettable it took four years for the Deputies opposite to realise the importance of this legislation. I heard a speaker say the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, thought it was unnecessary. The Government has learned four years later that it is needed – we will get there yet. Given that a good deal of work on a Bill similar to this goes unmentioned, it is good that John Farrelly is finally getting recognition for his work in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">This Bill makes common sense. It is the only way forward. Deputy Deasy said that in addition to this Bill much more is required. This is only the start and there is room for improvement in terms of setting standards and control mechanisms. What happens if a person on the door of a premises does not have a licence? Who will report that person and what will be done about it?</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The registering and training of private security guards makes common sense. I can only ponder why we had to wait until now for the introduction of this Bill, but it is better late than never. It is a simple though regrettable fact that in this modern era private security, that is bouncers, are needed in the pubs of our rural towns. They are also needed in chip shops and in almost every public building. We will probably see them outside churches soon. No function, particularly where alcohol is present, can be planned in this modern age without the security of the venue being at the forefront.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">We are the elected representatives of this country and it is our job to ensure this section of the growing security industry is the best this country can produce. If we do not do this, somebody else will and it will be left to police itself. As to what I mean by this, private security has for far too long been run in the shrouded secrecy of the black economy – a few bob here and there away from prying eyes. Meanwhile the problems of this sector can be seen plainly with the worst extremes played out on our streets and later in the courtrooms of this land on a weekly basis. This is not good enough and it must change.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">I have experienced this having managed a pub for years in which there was a security presence. Due to the tax situation many of these people work in the black economy. They are not trained  and are not legally employed. Therefore, this Bill is needed. If there was a row in my local club on a particular night and I went there the following morning to find out what bouncer was on duty or who was there to protect the people, the manager of the premises would say the security people are not employed by the club. If I were then to talk to the man in charge of security, he would say a different person works each night and that he does not know who was on duty the previous night. A log should be kept on every premises to show the bouncer on duty the previous night. People would then be in a position to make a complaint about him, if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Regulation of this sector is not to be feared by the many honest law-abiding people and businesses who either use private security services or provide them. The thousands of people who visit pubs and clubs see firsthand the work done by those who provide such services. When I worked as a bar manager I employed doormen and I could in no way find fault with those particular gentlemen. Without them, I could not have done my job and, in light of the way society has developed, I would not like to be doing it now. As good as these individuals were at their jobs, however, I would have been much happier if there had been a legally essential training course for them to undergo before taking up such responsible roles. I imagine all other managers, pub and club owners and members of the public feel the same way.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">I recall an incident which occurred when we employed a new bouncer to work on the door. We had no way to discover whether he had been trained and were obliged to take him at his word. A row broke out and when we sought out the bouncer he had disappeared because he did not know what to do. He was only a young man who needed some money. He looked the part but when it came to action he was not up to it. As a result, the remainder of the staff and I were obliged take on the thugs. No staff member should be placed in such a position. This is proof that the Bill is badly needed and should be fast-tracked.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Disputes or rows that break out from time to time may have to be settled in the law courts. As matters stand, private security guards or, to use the name given to them in popular culture, bouncers, really have no defined place in law. There are no set guidelines, no acceptable codes of behaviour and no yardstick by which they can be judged. This makes their job almost impossible. The Bill is only a beginning. We will be depending heavily on the new authority to set standards. The Bill does not offer much guidance and we will, therefore, be relying on the authority and we will be obliged to monitor its activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">There are bad apples in every walk of life. The lack of a central quality or assured register and training allows all types, both good and bad, to operate in this black economy. What is even more sinister is that, in the absence of the powers of the  State in this area, a lack of direction on our part allows gangs and organisations, whose respect for the law would be questionable in the first instance, to take up places of power in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">A new pub opened in Navan, County Meath, one or two years ago. I recall driving past and seeing seven or eight bouncers on the door who looked the part. I thought that was great, but I knew at first glance that two of them were drug dealers. This proves the point I am making about the need to regulate the sector. Every application for a licence, not just those the authority makes a request in respect of, should include a Garda reference. The Garda Síochána or an office or bureau established for the specific purpose should vet those making applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">In addition to the many good individuals, there are a number of dodgy characters working as doormen. These people have ample opportunity and have licence to engage in criminal activities such as drug dealing or operating protection rackets. This places us, as individuals, and the well-being of our children at risk because many of these people currently stand guard over many of our pubs and clubs. I am not saying this practice is widespread, but as has been proven in the past if an opportunity presents itself, cunning criminal brains will seize it to all our costs. At present, a vacuum exists and so does the opportunity. The legislation must be passed by the House as soon as possible in order to remove this opportunity from these ruthless people.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">As a bar manager I had some interesting experiences while assisting doormen in their duties. I outlined some of these previously and I will not rehearse them now. Firsthand knowledge of this subject has taught me that training is all important. The days of putting brawn without brains on the door of an establishment should be well and truly over. While good body language and a well-tempered word can cool a situation, the opposite can also be said of a wrong word or threatening posture or gesture. The atmosphere is often charged, fuelled by alcohol and excitement. It is so easy to cause this atmosphere to explode, with disastrous consequences for everyone. This is where cool, professional, well trained individuals will know their briefs and work as a team and that is invaluable. Muscle may not always be the answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">It is not always what one says, but the way one says it. While working in chippers and pubs and attending discos, I witnessed many instances where bouncers said the wrong thing or bared their teeth at an inopportune moment and caused an all-out row. When Ireland lost to Mexico at the 1994 World Cup finals, about ten or 11 thugs visited the establishment where I was working. Half of them were drunk, while the others were on drugs. They were fairly wild but we had done well in dealing with them. Some of the security personnel and staff had managed to calm them down. We had nearly got them off the premises when one of the bouncers decided he was Mr. Macho and grabbed a flag off one individual and  broke it in half. The whole place erupted. When the gardaí arrived two hours later the place was a mess. This shows how the wrong move by a bouncer can cause a row. In that context, I commend the Minister for bringing forward this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">For too long, trouble which starts in pubs on or dance floors has ended up on the streets and innocent bystanders have become involved. We must put a stop to this. The streets of our towns should be safe for 17 to 70 year olds at any time, night or day, and should not be left to thugs ejected from pubs or clubs. I say 17 year olds because anyone younger should be at home safe in his or her bed by midnight or 1 a.m. and their parents should know where they are. Other legislation to deal with this issue will be introduced in the future and it cannot but help.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Deputy Deasy referred earlier to CCTV, which is essential. Every town should have CCTV. I am aware that there are four or five pilot CCTV schemes throughout the country. My hometown, Navan, has been on a waiting list for CCTV for two to three years and I am of the view that we will be waiting a long time for it. Tax breaks should be provided to pub and club owners and various traders in particular streets to allow them to get together and provide CCTV coverage. I recall gardaí visiting various establishments in which I worked and seeking CCTV tapes which helped them to solve many crimes. Due to lack of resources, however, they often had to use our recorders to watch the footage because the equipment at the station was not suitable for this purpose. An integrated approach must be taken in respect of this matter. The Bill on its own will not prove sufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">There is a pub situated next door to my constituency office and the owner's CCTV system was of major assistance to me when someone visited my office in the middle of the night. The individual in question was caught on camera slipping through the door to my premises. CCTV works and will help gardaí, security personnel and others to do their jobs. It is essential that CCTV systems should be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">As already stated, the Bill on its own is not sufficient. Tougher legislation is required. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill was introduced when I first entered the House and it was stated that people who entered premises illegally would be fined a few hundred euro. That is a joke as people who break the law in this way are not going to be concerned about paying such an amount. We must get tough when dealing with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">I wish to ask the Minister to clarify a number of points. Section 35 states that anyone employing a person to provide security must ensure they have a licence. What will be the position in the case of a charity function or local festival where people will do this work free of charge? The organisers of such events often grab anyone they can to help with security on the night. Is there a grey area here or will those providing security events of this nature need a licence if they are not  being paid? There is no way all of these people can obtain licences. Will the Minister clarify the position in this regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The Garda Síochána should be involved in vetting all applications. I agree with Deputy Costello's suggestion that the Garda should provide people with certificates. However, I am anxious that further pressure should not be placed on Garda resources. There must be a way to ensure that someone in authority will be obliged to provide people with a certificate to accompany their application for a licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">Many speakers referred to the black economy. It is difficult to blame many of the people involved in the security sector for working in the black economy because being a bouncer is often their second job. They work as doormen on a part-time basis at weekends, usually late at night and in dangerous conditions. Perhaps the Minister could consult the Minister for Finance to discover whether these individuals could be given special tax breaks to make the job worth their while. Some of these people ask €100 or €150 for their services, while others are only paid €60 or €70. They work 40 hours per week in their primary jobs and by working at weekends they enter the higher tax bracket. If they work four or five hours as a bouncer for €60 gross, they receive approximately €30 into their hands. This means it is not really worth their while working. We are missing out on the services of good people. The capable individuals who we want to see doing this job will not do it because they will not be adequately rewarded. There must be some way to facilitate them within the tax regime in order to allow them to do their job.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

I look forward to great things from him. In light of my past experience of working with him on one of the Oireachtas committees, I believe I am in a position to say that we will see great things from him in time.

        <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_233">
          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_518">As many Members stated, this Bill is long overdue. The recent television programme probably pushed this Bill to the top of the agenda, which is the reason we are discussing it today. In a way that is a shame. The Bill is well constructed but there are areas which need to be changed and strengthened or which require greater certainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">First, I will discuss the need for the Bill. Other Members have also addressed this point. Society is developing in such a way that there is a greater need for security. In many country towns one will see, outside pubs and shops, people in uniforms and caps which bear crests showing they are  security personnel. This was not the case ten or 15 years ago. We did not need it. Today, however, we do. At night, in provincial towns and cities throughout the country, one will see burly door personnel outside the doors of every pub.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">This is indicative of the society we have allowed to develop and we should not let this occasion pass without commenting on it. How have we arrived at this situation, where life and limb are at risk and people are so afraid for their lives and property that they must employ security personnel? The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, has responsibility for the elderly. Older people, more than any others, are afraid. This should not be the case. All Members of the House have a responsibility to work together to try and change the thuggish culture that has developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The thuggish culture is one in which the right thing to do, it seems, is to go somewhere to have a fight or beat somebody up. There are unprovoked assaults on our streets. People are in hospitals today who, while going about their business without interference to anybody, were assaulted for no reason. Somebody attacked them with their fists or other objects to such an extent as to cause serious injury. That is indicative of the society we have developed. It is not good enough. Tourists, the old, women and grown men are attacked. Teenage boys, in particular, suffer attacks. A number of them have been badly hurt and sometimes killed for their mobile phones. We must examine this problem. The Government should establish an interdepartmental committee to do so. It should bring in all the agencies and investigate how this situation can be turned around.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Alcohol is a significant problem. Ireland is turning into a nation of alcoholics. This has huge implications not only for health but also for personal safety and security. Our nation is almost unique in Europe in that our people, it seems, cannot go out without getting drunk. It is the thing to do. The provisions of the Bill that get most of our attention are the ones dealing with door security at nightclubs, discos and public houses. The main reason for door security is abuse of alcohol so we need to change the culture in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Many young people have nothing to do and nowhere to go aside from pubs. The youth service is virtually non-existent and the amount of money we put into that area is miserable. The Oireachtas passed the Youth Work Act recently but it has to be implemented and resourced. Otherwise, more resources will have to be put into prisons, security and safety. That is the wrong way to go when the other option is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The state of our society is the reason for this Bill. Hospitals, businesses, schools, shops, pubs, discos and other facilities need security. I urge the Minister of State to give serious consideration to revoking or changing the licensing hours. The last change was a bad mistake. It is all right to have long opening hours in a mature society, where  people will drink responsibly. That is not the case in our society, especially when there is nothing else for people to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Fast food outlets are also causing problems on our streets. People come out of pubs and congregate around the fast food outlets. Invariably there is a row. These places should be closed before the pubs close. Nobody will starve if they cannot get a bag of chips at midnight or 1 a.m. but a life might be saved. There is no need for these outlets to be open. There are people in my home town who cannot get to sleep until four or five in the morning because these places are open.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">If somebody wishes to become a security man or woman, will they have to be registered? Will they have to hold a licence or will it be sufficient that their employer holds a licence? There is a degree of uncertainty about this in the Bill. I cannot see a definite requirement in the Bill that a person who wishes to become a security man or doorman must have a licence. Will it be enough for his or her employer to hold the licence? If so, it is not good enough. Every person who is working in this industry should be vetted, registered and licensed.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The Bill provides a list of the people, door supervisors and so forth, who are covered. Are bodyguards included? They are not specifically mentioned, although I have not had time to go through the Bill in detail. They should be mentioned because they are a separate recognised branch of security.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Everybody who works in the security sector should receive training. The people who were interviewed on the "Prime Time" programme made the point that training is crucial. It is wrong to give somebody a badge and a uniform and put him or her working in a premises without proper training. The training should be supervised, monitored and certified. In other words, the person should sit some type of examination at the end of his or her training. I am not sure if this is required; I cannot find such a provision in the Bill. Further down the road, however, it is something the authority should demand. We should become more professional in dealing with this matter because we are dealing with life and death.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Mention has been made of the identity cards security personnel would carry. There has been some debate as to whether the person should wear the card on their clothes so that it is visible. The card would probably carry the person's photograph and should be tamper proof and forgery proof, if there is such a term. It should also have a number. Each member of the Garda has a number so people working in the security industry should also have one. If there is a complaint of abuse, especially if it occurs at night, the person will be easily identified by their number. If it is dark and hard to see identification, a person will probably see the number. That is important. At the same time, we must be careful not to establish a pseudo-paramilitary group, wearing caps and badges, that would intimidate people.  Visibility is important but there is a thin line between being visible and intimidation. If people are trained properly, however, they will know how to deal properly with people and situations, which is crucially important.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I am pleased the Bill's provisions allow for people to be checked out before they undertake private security work. Therefore, people with a criminal record, or those with whom the Garda is unhappy, would not be allowed to work in the security sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Articles 43 and 49 of the European convention deal with the freedom to establish and provide services between EU member states, so will companies from other jurisdictions be able to operate here under the provisions of the Bill? If security firms from Britain or France, for example, wanted to set up business here would they be able to do so, and what steps would they have to take?</p>
          <p eId="para_532">Much of the private security industry concerns the management of conflict. Another uniformed pseudo-security group that has been involved in conflict are the wheel-clampers. Will they be included within the remit of the legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_533">A few years ago the Minister of State and I were involved in debating copyright issues, but will electronic security technicians be covered by the Bill? Many issues, including security of information in cyberspace, are now arising through the increased use of the Internet. Those working in the electronic security sector are private investigators of a sort, but will they be covered by the Bill? The legislation must be able to deal with cybercrime, including pornography on the Internet and breaches of copyright and patent law. Will investigators working in those areas be included within the parameters of the Bill? Perhaps the Minister can answer those questions when he replies later.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The Bill refers to people who accompany dogs on patrol, but perhaps the legislation should provide for the obligatory training of guard dogs. If a dog is not properly trained and does not respond to commands by its handler, the animal could become dangerous. If someone is working with a guard dog the animal should be properly trained. Such animals could be tested to see if they obey commands properly. The Minister would not be too happy if he was attacked by a guard dog whose handler could not control it. We must ensure that cannot happen. Perhaps that point can be included in the Bill during later Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The Bill seeks to establish a private security authority, including a practising barrister, two private security employers and employees, and a representative of the Garda Commissioner. In the past, however, it was suggested that such bodies would be discussed by a Dáil committee before being established. In that way the Minister's proposal could be vetted by the Oireachtas but the last Government was totally against this idea. In dealing with the Railway Procurement Agency Bill and other legislation, the former Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator O'Rourke, promised  that this proposal would be examined within the framework of Oireachtas reform, and that a Dáil committee would have an input in the appointment of people to statutory authorities. Although the Bill does not envisage this matter, I am raising it again because I think we should take this step.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I am pleased that the private security authority will have strategic plans and the power to investigate the industry. For too long the private security sector was seen as an uncomplicated area that did not warrant much attention. At long last, however, it will now receive the attention it deserves. The private security authority will be able to investigate, in its own right, any security services provided by any person.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">There is no doubt that the private security sector has operated as part of the black economy for years. Has the Minister examined the possibility of requiring potential private security personnel to obtain tax clearance certificates before taking up employment in the sector? If not, we will be giving the nod to the black economy and saying, "It is okay. We will let them off". We should examine that issue which would help to professionalise the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">What is the Minister's view on members of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces or the prisons service working as private security staff? Perhaps he can deal with that question in his reply to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The Bill is necessary and I could say much more about it if time permitted. I will be watching closely its progress through the House. The legislation needs to be enacted pretty soon, notwithstanding a proper debate on Committee Stage. Once the Bill has passed all Stages, we should not have to wait for months for the required action to be taken on foot of its enactment. Proper resources must be provided to the new private security authority to enable it to carry out its work effectively. Let us hope that as a result of this legislation the private security industry will be taken out of the darkness in which it currently operates. The Bill should grant the industry a respectability it has not had up to now.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">Unless we deal with the underlying problems in our society that have led to the massive growth in the private security industry, we will see more such problems arising in future.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_542">The outline proposals which were published by the European Commission on 10 July 2002 as a communication on the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy were discussed at the Council of Ministers in July, September and October.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">At the Brussels European Council on 24 and 25 October, the EU Heads of State and Government decided on the funding for agriculture in a Union of 25 until 2013. This decision was without prejudice to the results of the mid-term review. The examination of the Commission's communication will, accordingly, continue in the Council of Ministers and the Commission's detailed proposals will be published in the coming months. However, there is unlikely to be a qualified majority in the Council for the implementation of significant change in the CAP before 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I have already stated in the Council that I will not agree to changes in the Agenda 2000 agreement which will impact negatively on the Irish agriculture and food industry.

          <p eId="para_549">I thank the Minister for his reply. Will he agree that when the concept of the mid-term reform was floated by Mr. Fischler, it caused a lot of distortion and anxiety, it had an impact on the market in that people were purchasing in anticipation that they could build up premia payments as a reserve to be taken into consideration for future EU payments and it may have caused a difficulty with land rent? There were two Council meetings in September and October, yet the farming community is no wiser with respect to these proposals. Hardly a day goes that I do not get correspondence from someone asking what is the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Is the Minister saying that the Fischler proposals are finished with until 2007, that there will be no change to the Agenda 2000 agreement? Will he agree that all this concept of floating ideas  does is give rise to a lack of confidence in EU policy? Will the Minister agree that if the EU Commission was a company quoted on the stock market which carried out the same practices and floated the same information, perhaps it would be up on charges of unethical behaviour and unfair trading, and that it is unacceptable that he has stood by without taking on the Commission in this matter?</p>

          <p eId="para_551">In the Berlin agreement on Agenda 2000 in March 1999 there was provision for a mid-term review. What caused consternation and anxiety among the farming and agriculture industry throughout the European Union was that instead of a review proposals were put on the table by Commissioner Fischler which envisaged fundamental reform of the core principles of Agenda 2000. Immediately my response to those was that they were unacceptable, that we would not support them and, in particular, that two of the issues contained in the proposals, that is decoupling and modulation, were far beyond review and they were going into the core principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The up-to-date position is that the Heads of Government last month agreed upon the financial framework up to 2013 but the Fischler proposals are still on the table, but they are only proposals. As I stated in my reply, I am confident that there is not a qualified majority to get them through but they are still on the table.</p>

Will he agree there is really no EU Commission policy at present because the EU is allowing non-EU commodities to flood the market, in grain and beef from Argentina? The purpose of these measures is purely political appeasement rather than protection of the aims of the Common Agricultural Policy as agreed when the treaties were initially signed.</p>

The reason put forward by Commissioner Fischler for the proposal in the first place was to get in ahead of the WTO negotiations and, in relation to decoupling, to avoid challenge to the blue box direct payments in support of agriculture. We have met the French, in particular, in bilateral talks and we will ensure that the future of the CAP supporting multi-functional agriculture will remain the chief policy of Commissioner Fischler and the Commission.</p>

      <b>Mr. Sargent</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Agriculture and Food</b>
      if he will meet experts and formulate policy urgently in the area of sterilising and minimising waste caused by SRM and BSE infected carcases using the combined techno logies of alkaline hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion which, unlike incineration, is proven to kill the BSE prion and has satisfied customers throughout the USA, Europe and Asia.
      [20917/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_556">Current EU legislation provides for the disposal of BSE positive material either by burial or by incineration. The methods of disposal referred to by the Deputy are not currently approved at EU level for the disposal of SRM or BSE infected carcases. Most member states either incinerate BSE positive carcases directly or render them into meat and bonemeal, which is then incinerated. However, there are currently no suitable incineration facilities in Ireland and the integrated pollution control licences of the three rendering plants currently approved for rendering SRM do not permit them to render BSE positive material.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The Deputy will be aware that prior to October 2000, BSE positive carcases were deep buried on the farm upon which the disease was discovered. At that time I decided to terminate the practice of burying these carcases to allay concerns expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">In the absence of appropriate disposal facilities in Ireland, a decision was made to keep these carcases in a secure and dedicated cold storage facility until such time as a mechanism for their ultimate disposal could be found. Against this background, officials from my Department met on several occasions with commercial promoters for the alkaline hydrolysis technology and have seen a demonstration of the system. My Department is prepared to keep an open mind on the technology and indeed any other technology which may offer the possibility of disposing of BSE positive carcases in a manner which is consistent with animal health, public health and environmental legislation. However, before technology can be used for the disposal of positive BSE material, the process must be cleared by the EU's Scientific Steering Committee. Following approval by that committee, it would be necessary to secure the relevant EPA and local authority approvals in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Non-BSE infected SRM material is at present rendered to a temperature of 133 degrees centigrade under three bars of pressure for 20 minutes at three dedicated rendering plants and the resultant meat and bonemeal is exported to EU countries for incineration. There is no significant backlog of this material for disposal.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_560">I am not sure if the Minister's reply is absolutely up to date or if he wishes to refer to other than the European Union. Is he aware that alkaline hydrolysis technology is fully approved by the United States Department of Agriculture and that the World Health Organisation recommends a combination of alkaline and heat treatment as the only method known to completely destroy the prion, which is the main problem with BSE? Has he had regard to the Euro pean legislation in which the Scientific Steering Committee approved new technologies and approves alkaline hydrolysis? Is he saying that he has other information, because I believe my information is up to date?</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Notwithstanding the newness of the technology, although it has been around since 1992, will the Minister accept that Ireland must be a pioneer in this regard rather than follow other countries in which agriculture may not play as important a role as it does in Ireland? Given the importance for marketing in Ireland of maintaining incineration-free status, will he take into account that we would be very severely disadvantaged compared to countries like New Zealand, which has a clear policy and an understanding that it prefers not to have incineration, primarily for the international marketability of its agricultural produce? Will the Minister be more pioneering in this regard? Will he meet again with these people, not with a view to being aware of their existence but to harnessing the technology and letting Ireland lead rather than follow the EU in the minimisation of BSE special risk waste material?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_245">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_562">I confirm that I met the company. I did so with a view to availing of the technology. I am open to availing of new technology as it comes along, particularly when we are constrained with other systems of disposal. I encouraged the company to make an application to the European scientific committee to get approval for this system, which would destroy the prion and would be suitable as a rendering process. The European scientific steering committee has not yet given such approval. If and when it does I will be the first person to seek its implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">One of my concerns about the use of alkaline hydrolysis relates to the fact that the amount of material for disposal after the process is increased by 600%. One is then faced with the problem of disposing of the residue, because of the vast amount of water used in the alkaline hydrolysis process.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">I want to assure the Deputy and the House that BSE positive material is handled to the highest standards in accordance with the appropriate legislation, which reflects the expert views of the EU Scientific Steering Committee. The appropriate legislation is EU veterinary legislation under which the only approved means of disposal of such material are burial or incineration.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">My Department discontinued the practice of burial of BSE carcases in late 2000 and in the absence of any suitable incineration facility within the State, it has been necessary to make interim storage arrangements, pending a resolution of the problem of ultimate disposal of the carcases. Since November 2000, such carcases have been frozen and stored in a secure, dedicated cold store, owned by the Department and located in County Tipperary.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">These carcases are double wrapped in polypropylene bags and inserted into strong body bags prior to being transported to the cold store on metal cages aboard dedicated transport vehicles. I am satisfied my Department has taken every possible precaution in relation to this operation and that it is complying fully with current national and EU animal health, public health, planning and environmental legislation in relation to this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">I assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to manage all relevant aspects of the BSE issue in a manner which protects public health, animal health and the environment, in conjunction as necessary with other statutory bodies. In this regard, Ireland's handling of all aspects of BSE is subject to ongoing scrutiny from various perspectives by independent bodies such as the EU's Food and Veterinary Office, the Food and Safety Authority of Ireland and others, and has been recognised time and again as comprehensive, rigorous and responsible.</p>

          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_573">I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. However, my question was whether BSE positive material is classified as hazardous, if there is a requirement to do that and, accordingly, if there is a requirement to inform the appropriate local authority where the material is stored.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">I have no doubt the Minister is aware of ongoing Government research in the United Kingdom which is to be completed in 2007. That research is examining the possibility of contaminated soil, for example, being a source of infection. My question relates to the possibility of, for instance, fire in the cold store and the consequences for the local environment if that were to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Is the waste classified as hazardous, does the county council know about the storage of the material and has it given approval for it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_252">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_576">The matter is not classified as hazardous because this material comes under TSE Regulation 999 of 2001 and will be dealt with by the animal by-products Council Regulation 1774/2002. It is not, therefore, covered by the waste directives. Under national legislation the designation of waste material is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. However, I do not wish to pass the buck. The fact remains that this is not classified as hazardous material and it does not come under the waste directives. It is regulated by the veterinary directives and legislation, and we are complying fully with those veterinary regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">As far as the designation of waste material as hazardous is concerned, this comes under Council Directive 75/442/EEC which excludes from the scope of the directive animal carcases where their disposal is covered by other legislation. The county manager was immediately informed that we had terminated the burial of carcases and were storing them pending disposal.</p>

          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_578">Further to the Minister's reply and for future reference, since the number of BSE cases continues to increase, are there plans for the expansion of this cold storage facility, are there other cold storage facilities in the country or will there be a need to provide further storage facilities in the interim?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_254">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_579">There is adequate room in the storage facility concerned for the foreseeable future. We expect the number of BSE cases to decline sharply in the next couple of years. The age profile is increasing substantially and that is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">In late 2000 when burial was terminated, in a reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Upton on 16 May 2001, I stated that there were 87 BSE positive carcases in frozen storage. This matter is well known. We have a problem and that is why alkaline hydrolysis is so attractive to me. We have no way of disposing of BSE positive carcases now.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">I assure the House and the Deputy there is adequate room for the foreseeable future in the cold room.</p>

      <b>Mr. Hayes</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Agriculture and Food</b>
      the reason 5,000 farmers received letters informing them they would be permitted premium payments only on a certain number of sheep from 1 January 2003 and that they would have only one year to shed the balance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [20909/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_255">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_583">My Department has issued letters to 6,276 farmers notifying them of the preliminary calculation of their permitted stocking levels for the 2003 ewe premium year on foot of the commonage framework plans. In 4,183 cases there  was a requirement to destock on existing levels. More than 650 farmers who had previously had quota frozen will have some restored. The remainder will have no further destocking requirement since their frozen quota already constitutes a sufficient reduction in stocking levels. The average net destocking requirement is 20 ewes per farmer.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">While letters have issued to a number of farmers requiring them to destock to single figures or to destock completely, I have decided that all such farmers can retain a flock of ten ewes on which premium can continue to be paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The freezing of ewe quota on some commonages is the outcome of an agreement between my Department and the EU Commission in 1998, which secured generous REPS payments of up to €242 per hectare to farmers with commonage. This agreement was reached at a time when overgrazing by sheep, particularly on commonages in the west, had reached a point where the Commission had threatened to stop all REPS payments on those areas. My Department had to suspend the processing of REPS applications in the six western counties that included large areas of commonage. As a result of the 1998 agreement with the Commission, however, an additional €7 million per year is now being paid on top of the basic REPS payment to the 3,700 farmers with commonage land who are in REPS. This represents an average annual additional payment of €1,800 per farmer and it brings the total average annual payment for REPS farmers with commonage land to €7,100.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"><i>Additional information</i>Under the 1998 agreement with the Commission, my Department together with Dúchas was required to have individual framework plans prepared for each commonage. Letters have now issued to farmers with ewe quota because the framework plans have been mostly completed. Individual stocking levels have been calculated with reference to the destocking requirement of the relevant plans together with the data already held in the Department in respect of the farmers concerned. While ewe premium in 2003 will be payable only on the quota now notified to them, farmers will have a year to bring their actual stocking levels into line with these calculations and can therefore choose the most advantageous time to sell or acquire stock.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">The destocking arrangements are required to implement measures to protect and rejuvenate commonage areas that may be at risk because of overgrazing. They are an integral part of the agreement which the EU Commission secured in 1998. Any failure to implement them would put in question the generous REPS payments based on that agreement. Farmers who are subject to these measures, if they are not already participating in REPS, must apply during 2003 to join REPS or a complementary national scheme to be operated by Dúchas.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Any change to the 1998 agreement would have to be re-negotiated with the EU Commission. In the context of the consultative process on REPS which I recently announced, the participating stakeholders will have an opportunity to discuss the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">This matter arose because of gross over-grazing in commonage and mountain areas in the west of Ireland. As I said, the Commission threatened the Department with terminating the REPS completely, and following consultation with the farming organisations and negotiating a deal with Brussels in 1998, an additional €7 million per annum is paid to those farmers, bringing their total payment to an average of €7,100 per annum, €242 per hectare.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">If farmers with commonages are suffering from hardship the first thing they need to do is apply for and participate in the REPS. The deal that was hammered out in 1998 in respect of commonage framework plans substantially increases the REPS payments to allow for this destocking and to compensate for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_600">To date, of the six, three claims for payment have been received. No payment has actually issued to date. The procedure followed in my Department in the evaluation and selection of projects in the potato sector is the same for all other sectors included in the overall scheme. This procedure is as follows. An advertisement is placed in the local, general and farming press. Following this, a total of 28 applications were received from the potato sector, all of which were evaluated by officials in the relevant divisions of the Department of Agriculture and Food, by reference to viability, target markets, sectoral and regional impacts, particularly at primary producer level, and the extent to which they would improve the saleability of the primary product. Two of the applications were found to be ineligible while a third was subsequently withdrawn, leaving a total of 25 applications of the 28 to be considered. Between them, the 25 applications in the potato sector had a grant aid requirement of almost €10 million while the funding available for this sector amounted to €2 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Funding under the scheme is limited and eligibility alone does not necessarily confer an entitlement to grant aid. Accordingly, all applications must be subjected to a competitive assessment and ranking process.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The selection committee, which comprises four assistant secretaries of Department of Agriculture and Food and a representative from Enterprise Ireland, met on 20 March 2002 to consider these applications. The committee was provided with information on the potato sector in general, priorities of this sector, details of previous total funding awarded in this sector and an individual fiche, which is a synopsis of the application for each project. Having taken into  account the above factors and the individual applications, the committee recommended that seven projects be selected for the award of grant aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"><i>Additional information</i>On 28 March 2002 six projects were submitted to me for approval and I approved these six. A seventh project, while provisionally selected by the selection committee, was not submitted to me pending further investigation into certain aspects of the application. This investigation subsequently proved that this application was ineligible and, as such, was never submitted to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I am satisfied that the scheme was correctly and fairly administered by my officials at all stages of the process and I intend to continue the operation of the scheme as set out in the overall marketing and processing programme. It is my understanding that the background to the decision process has been explained in considerable detail to the Deputy.</p>

How can the taxpayers have confidence in the selection process when €308,000 was directly recommended to an applicant who did not meet the basic eligibility requirements of the scheme and who only decided to meet the requirements, by way of a planning application, some nine days after being informed by his Deputy, or Minister, in Donegal that he had been allocated a grant? In addition, how can they have confidence given that the applicant was also a staunch Fianna Fáil supporter? It is true that this grant has been stopped, but that is due to me and other growers. Is the Minister aware that senior officials within the food division informed representatives of the IFA, Teagasc and representatives of potential applicants that this particular scheme did not cover the added on elements associated with potatoes, such as peeling, chipping and processing, and discouraged growers from applying on that basis? Notwithstanding that, the selection committee and the Minister approved of it and proceeded to allocate £390,000 and £160,000, respectively, to applicants who breached the sectoral priority of the scheme and who are alleged to have been well known supporters of Fianna Fáil. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>

      <b>Mr. P. McGrath</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Agriculture and Food</b>
      the reason Irish commercial beef exports to non-EU countries for 2000 was 255,000 tonnes while it was only 50,000 tonnes for 2001; the projected export figure for 2002; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [20688/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_311">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_653">In consideration of the beef export profile for 2002, account must be taken of the enormous increase in the level of exports to the United Kingdom, expected to be in the order of 230,000 tonnes. It has always been my policy that the beef industry should develop its exports to European Union markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">As regards third country markets, following the BSE crisis late in 2000, many such markets imposed bans on imports of European beef. While it is clear that these restrictions were imposed Europe-wide against the background of a crisis in mainland Europe and did not adequately reflect the many levels of BSE controls in place in Ireland at the time, the net effect for Irish exporters was that almost all our significant non-EU markets for beef, with the exception of Russia, were closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">As a consequence of the restrictions on European beef imports imposed by third countries, the EU introduced on 1 January 2001 a purchase for destruction scheme which resulted in the removal of 278,000 cattle from the supply chain in 2001. Furthermore, exports of beef to the UK in 2001 amounted to 210,000 tonnes, which was an increase of 100,000 tonnes on exports to that market in 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">Since that time, no effort has been spared at political, diplomatic and technical level to have those markets reopened. As a result of these efforts, Egypt has lifted its restriction on imports of Irish beef and my Department has agreed with  the Egyptian authorities the veterinary issues to permit trade to recommence. Following my representations to Commissioner Fischler, the EU Commission decided recently to increase export refunds for Egypt by up to 30%. This new special high rate of export refunds will make Irish beef more competitive on the Egyptian market and should help bring about the resumption of trade to a very important traditional market.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMcGrath" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_657">Is the Minister disappointed with the level of exports outside the European Union, especially to the Egyptian market? Is he disappointed that these exports have not opened up and what is his response? The Minister outlined the reason for the reduction in exports and balanced that against the increase in exports to the United Kingdom. Does he agree that the exports to the United Kingdom are of a temporary nature arising from the loss of much British beef due to the BSE crisis and the subsequent dramatic fall in production?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_313">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_658">I am disappointed about a number of aspects of the beef industry. With regard to exports, my preferred choice is the most remunerative markets, those that give the best return. They are in the European Union. We have substantially increased exports to the United Kingdom market, from 90,000 tonnes two years ago to 230,000 tonnes this year. I am disappointed that 75% of such exports go to the catering and general wholesale trade while only 25% goes to the high return consumer retail shelves. I do not agree that this is a temporary phenomenon. The United Kingdom market is competitive but we should be exporting to the retail shelves.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Access to third country markets have been opened, for example, the ban on exports to Egypt has been removed. The Egyptian market was not supplied by the factories and the processing industry here because they maintained that export subsidies were too low. When I made representations to Commissioner Fischler he agreed to increase export subsidies, especially for Egypt, by 30%, yet still no Irish beef is being exported there, apart from the pilot consignment. I am disappointed with this because the trade should look on this as a medium and long-term operation. It should get into Egypt and increase the market there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMcGrath" eId="spk_314">
          <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_660">The Minister expressed disappointment that the Egyptian market has not opened. Does he agree that the consignment of beef launched to that market earlier this year was a general election gimmick and that it has not been followed up? Will he outline the efforts he has made to reopen this market? Has he revisited the county and has he looked at other markets outside the European Union? If so, will he provide details and indicate to what extent he has been successful?</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Will the Minister accept that the bulk of the additional exports to Britain are linked entirely  to the destructive consequences of the BSE outbreak there? What evidence does he have to suggest that our markets there will continue when the British industry recovers?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_315">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_662">The destruction following the BSE crisis and the over 30 months scheme has been helpful, but that has been the case for other European countries. The Irish industry managed to increase its beef exports to the United Kingdom from 90,000 tonnes to 230,000 tonnes.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">The Egyptian market is open and the ban on Irish beef has been removed. I can hardly take the beef there myself. It is a matter for the commercial industry to export it. I have visited Egypt and Cairo and have more sand under my nostrils in consequence than any Member of this House.</p>

He mentioned that only 25% of beef exports to the United Kingdom made their way to the top stream consumer shelves. Does he agree that this is because of a failure to recognise the importance of quality, including a failure by the Department to implement the beef assurance scheme, by the factories to pay farmers for quality product and by the EU Commission for ensuring that the premia payment is the same for a poor quality as for a good quality animal? Until such time as we start to pay for quality we will continue to have these difficulties.</p>

          <p eId="para_669">There is a serious problem with the Irish cattle and beef industry in that there is little or no regard for quality. The total subsidy for the cattle and beef industry amounts to over €1 billion per annum, yet we are at the lower end of the market, either in the United Kingdom or Russia. We are now trying to get into Egypt. Farmers get between 80p and 85p per lb depending on the grade. A subsidy of €540 per animal is applied on top of that for first premium,  second premium, extensification and slaughter premium, while the export subsidy amounts to 48p per lb, yet the farmer may only get 80p per lb.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">That does not make economic sense under any circumstances and that is why Commissioner Fischler is talking about a decoupling scheme. He will pay the farmers not to produce. We must have regard to quality. We have been told time and again that cattle 30 months or over are not required anywhere but people have been fattening cattle for over 30 months and then we have a problem getting rid of them. The industry will have to seriously consider this matter. Having disputes and protests is no use unless the reality of the marketplace is considered. I must refer to the matter raised regarding the election.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Aylward)</from>
          <p eId="para_680">Rules concerning animal and public health controls on imports  of animal products into EU member states are, in the main, laid down at EU level. These harmonised control measures, together with inspections and reports carried out by the EU's food and veterinary office, are designed to ensure that such imports come from establishments and countries that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Products of animal origin may only be imported into the EU from premises which have been approved by the European Commission. In cases where the food and veterinary office is not satisfied that public health requirements are being met, countries and premises may be removed from the EU approved list by Commission decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">In addition, EU law requires that animal-based products imported from third countries must be processed through a border inspection post in the first EU member state into which they are introduced. Such products must be accompanied by appropriate veterinary health certification issued by the authorities in the country from which they are exported and are subject to identity and documentary checks. A proportion of such imports are subjected to physical checks, which may include sampling and analysis. These are routine operational matters and it is not normally the practice to report on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The EU Commission may, from time to time, require additional checks on particular products from particular countries of origin where there is specific cause for concern. One of the recent examples of such a decision is the current Commission decision requiring member states to test all consignments of poultry meat and certain fisheries products from Thailand for nitrofurans, a substance which is banned in the European Union. Where circumstances warrant it, the Commission may make a decision to ban such imports altogether. My Department is rigorous in the application of EU rules in relation to all such imports.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Testing carried out in line with safeguard measures is reported to the European Commission and displayed on its rapid alert system. This is a mechanism for advising member states of action to be taken with regard to contaminated products.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">On the question of personal imports, the Minister introduced Statutory Instrument 390 in July 2002 to ensure that only animal products that meet relevant EU and national legislation can be imported into Ireland in personal baggage. Products which do not conform to the relevant rules are seized and sent for immediate destruction.</p>

Does he accept that in the area of investigating, for example, potato varieties, it is absolutely useless to send samples to Donegal to have them grown and then verified within a number of months, particularly as laboratories exist that can do genetic testing within 100 yards of the Department of Agriculture and Food? Does he accept there is a need for the Department to update its procedures so that testing can be done quickly and effectively and in time for the market and farmers' interests to be protected?</p>

Is the Minister aware that the food standard agency in the UK has recently advised border inspection post officials that Brazilian poultry meat should be tested and detained until the results come back from the laboratories? We need more than documentation, we need testing and, if necessary, quarantine of these products until the results are available.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, well in his first Question Time since he came to the Department. I have received anecdotal evidence in recent weeks regarding young children suffering from blood pressure that may have resulted from hormones in certain foods. This is an area of grave concern and one we hope to follow up in the agriculture committee. There is much anxiety about imported foodstuffs from non-EU countries and I urge the Minister to put it at the top of his agenda.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamAylward" eId="spk_336" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food">
          <from>Mr. Aylward</from>
          <p eId="para_691">I accept that no matter what guidelines are in operation they can all be improved upon. I outlined the five areas of strict regulation that are operated here and within the EU and there are other controls that pertain here also. Advance notice of imports must be made to the Department by means of a VET 1 form. All importers are required to be registered with the Department and all products of animal origin must be prepared and stored in an approved  establishment. All consignments undergo an identity and documentary check. I will not go through all the regulations but there is a full list available.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">In reference to the question in regard to the UK, we have thankfully had only one experience of problems with fishery products from Thailand and Brazil. Only one consignment of Thai chicken proved positive for any substance and it was destroyed. It had been cleared through a border inspection post in the UK. The Department notified the UK chief veterinary office of the incident and assurances were received that in future all consignments of poultry meat cleared through the UK border inspection post would be tested.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">I take on board what Deputy Timmins said in regard to the committee on agriculture and we will certainly follow up recommendations that come from it. The Minister established the food labelling committee in July this year to examine issues in regard to the labelling of food, including the matter of origin. In this regard we are anxious that consumers get the most comprehensive information possible on the food supply thereby enabling them to exercise their rights abut which food product they wish to buy. The 19 member expert group which is representative of all the major stakeholders in the food chain, including the FSAI, has been examining these issues since its inaugural meeting on 29 August. I was informed today that the group is on course to complete its report by the end of this month and I expect it will include recommendations on compulsory labelling of origin within the EU legislative framework.</p>

          <p eId="para_698">I offer my profound apologies to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Members who have raised this important matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The Government is concerned about the potential implications of this incident. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland contacted the British authorities and the British nuclear installation inspectorate immediately upon learning of this incident. The inspectorate was informed by the British Ministry of Defence that the incident had no implications for nuclear or radiological safety because no damage had been done and an investigation into the incident would be undertaken immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">The RPII is maintaining contact with the British nuclear installation inspectorate and awaiting the outcome of the investigation, which, I hope, will be known quickly. Everything that could be done was done immediately. The situation is being monitored and, as soon as we are made aware of the outcome of the investigation, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will inform the House. We have been assured that no damage was done to the submarine and that there are no nuclear or radiological implications following this incident.</p>

          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_701">Is the Minister aware that, not only was damage done to the submarine, but three people were also injured? Is he further aware the latest reports indicate that a trainee was at the controls when the nuclear vessel in question crashed and that the incident was not reported publicly for 24 hours? How could the Government have been made immediately aware of the incident if it was not made public in Britain? Given the publicity the Government has received for its alleged interest in Sellafield, is it not a fact that nuclear submarines, some perhaps with trainees at the controls, are traversing the Irish Sea morning, noon and night? Is it not time the British and Irish Governments jointly established some machinery to monitor these submarines?</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The Minister should be aware that when a nuclear accident was raised previously in the House, people were equally as dismissive only to discover later that, even though the incident had occurred in a distant place, Chernobyl, there were implications for Ireland. This incident occurred off the west coast of Scotland. It is probably inevitable that the submarine was in Irish waters. Will the Minister ensure our ambassador in  London makes inquiries of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Secretary of State for Defence in Britain regarding the implications of this nuclear accident for Ireland?</p>

        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_343" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_703">The Government regards this as a serious incident and immediately made its concerns known to the British authorities. I reiterate the RPII was informed by the Ministry of Defence that the incident had no implications for nuclear or radiological safety, whatever about the staff on the submarine. We demanded an investigation, which is under way. It has only commenced and we are monitoring it. We want to establish the full details surrounding the incident. I agree with the Deputy that when nuclear facilities are subject to accidents, the implications are very grave, particularly when they occur so near Ireland. We are monitoring the incident and I will convey the Deputy's request that our ambassador in London should be acquainted with its seriousness.</p>

          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_706">We have often read of tragedies involving ships that have disappeared for which anecdotal evidence was offered that they had collided with submarines. Does the Minister agree, following this accident, that this view may be well founded? Irrespective of whether the RPII is aware of the incident, it does not have the facility to protect Ireland. The greatest threat to the State's security is posed by nuclear submarines which may be travelling within a few miles of the vast majority of our population, and not Sellafield, which is stationary and can be seen. That is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">On a point of information, the Taoiseach has decided not to be present on Thursdays. This is not a reflection on the Ministers opposite and perhaps Deputy Walsh does not wish to comment. However, today's business has been a sham. First, the debate on the Private Security Services Bill was closed by a Minister who read a script and Question Time concluded at 4.20 p.m., following which no Minister was available to reply to a private notice question tabled to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. With respect to the  Minister for Agriculture and Food, he stood into the breach and replied. However, this is totally unacceptable. When the cat's away, the mice will play. The issue of the Taoiseach not attending the House on Thursdays must be revisited.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">This incident is a worrying development for our people and I would like the Minister to relay its seriousness to the Taoiseach and the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">The Government regards this matter as extremely serious. We immediately instituted inquiries and an investigation is under way. As soon as the outcome of the investigation is known, we will inform the House of the full details. However, we cannot do so at the moment because the preliminary inquiry has only commenced. I take the Deputy's point that nuclear craft in Irish waters or near Irish waters are a hazard and will convey the full weight of the concern expressed by the Members to the relevant authorities in Ireland for conveyance to the British authorities.</p>

          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_711">I once asked an American naval officer whether he had ever been in Ireland and he replied that he had not, but that he had seen it many times through his periscope. Is the Minister aware that a rear admiral stated: "A reactor core integrity assessment of the nuclear reactor has been conducted and there is no risk to the public or the crew. . . The reactor was perfectly safe at all times and the pressure hull is very thick."?  One thinks it is probably as thick as the necks of the spokespersons for the Ministry of Defence. Will the Minister join Charles Kennedy, MP for Skye, and me in seeking an independent inquiry into what happened? Will the Minister make a case to the British Government for an Irish presence at such an inquiry given the implications of such accidents for Irish safety?</p>
          <p eId="para_712">For all we know, there may have been many other accidents which have not been reported or discovered. It took 24 hours before this accident was reported and then only because men were injured and the submarine had to surface. This has implications for the Irish Sea. Will the Minister ensure that this matter is raised with the highest authority? We must ensure that Ireland uses every influence it can to find out what happened in this case and in cases related to nuclear safety in or near our waters which have implications for our citizens.</p>

I understand the British Energy Minister, Brian Wilson, will speak in Dublin this evening.

I heard Charles Kennedy speak about this issue this morning and he made a compelling case for an independent inquiry. I do not know if that will be granted, but I will put the case that Ireland should have appropriate representation at that inquiry to ensure we know what is going on. This is a serious situation. The Government has been fighting a case in court in recent weeks regarding Sellafield. Chernobyl was an eye opener for many people. The devastation, destruction and human misery it caused is still felt by many people. We regard this matter seriously. I will convey the concerns expressed by the Deputies at the highest level.</p>

It is my first occasion to speak in the House and I cannot think of a more important or urgent issue to north Tipperary than the provision and speedy implementation of the national breast screening service in view of recent developments in breast screening services in the mid-west region.</summary>
        <summary class="Center" eId="sum_14">I want the Minister for Health and Children to provide an updated, fast, efficient and accessible breast screening service for the mid-west region and north Tipperary. This matter arose recently due to the withdrawal of mammography services at Nenagh General Hospital. A mammogram unit was in place and operational for approximately 13 years. It was provided through the fund-raising efforts of the Friends of Nenagh General Hospital, the north Tipperary ICA and many other support groups. However, the service has been withdrawn and a void has been created. This means that women in Nenagh, Thurles, Roscrea, Templemore, Borrisokane, Lorrha and Riverstown must now access breast screening services at Limerick Regional Hospital.</summary>
        <summary class="Center" eId="sum_15">Surveys have proven that north Tipperary and the mid-west region have a higher rate of cancer than most other places. That is alarming in view of the recent closure of the mammography service in Nenagh General Hospital. It is well known that early detection of breast cancer means more women will lead normal lives.</summary>
        <summary class="Center" eId="sum_16">I understand the national screening programme will have mobile screening units when it is extended to the mid-west region. I anticipate that the breast screening service will be regular and accessible. I call on the Minister to introduce, without delay, the national screening programme to the mid-west region. It is vitally important that women who need the breast screening service can access it locally. The mobile breast screening unit is a welcome concept. Perhaps the Minister could explain how it will operate, how often it will be in the region and how accessible it will be to women. I urge the Minister to treat this matter urgently. A fast, effective and accessible breast screening service should be provided for the women of north Tipperary.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_720">I congratulate and thank Deputy Hoctor for raising this important issue on her first occasion to speak in the House. I wish her well. I am glad of the opportunity to set out the current position regarding the development of breast cancer services generally and in the Mid-Western Health Board in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The national breast screening programme was established in 1998 with the aim of reducing mortality from breast cancer by 20% by screening women in the age group of 50 to 64 years of age. BreastCheck commenced screening in March 2000, with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Midland Health Board and the North-Eastern Health Board areas. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. The experience gained in phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll-out of the programme nationwide. To the end of August this year almost 92,000 women had been called for screening and more than 68,000 women had been screened, representing an uptake of 74%.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">My commitment, and that of the Department of Health and Children, to BreastCheck is evidenced by significant funding which has been provided for the programme. This year additional funding of €1.5 million was provided to BreastCheck for the continued development of the programme, bringing the total allocation to €8.7million. In addition, I have allocated approximately €6 million for the construction of a new state-of-the-art screening unit at St. Vincent's Hospital. Work is expected to commence shortly on this development.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">I am fully committed to the development of quality services to achieve best health outcomes. As regards the development of cancer services generally, this commitment can be seen in the level of funding provided. Since 1997 more than €103 million has been invested in the development of services, which is well in excess of the £25 million initially envisaged in the national cancer strategy. This investment has enabled the funding of 76 additional consultant posts in key areas and it includes approval which has been given for nine new consultant posts with a special interest in breast disease. I have invested considerably in this programme for the provision of services for symptomatic breast disease in recent years and further investment is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">While much has been achieved in recent years in relation to the development of the health service, there is still much to be done. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation by the end of 2002 of a  revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy, 2003-10, is being prepared by the National Cancer Forum. The new strategy will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years. This will have regard to existing policies in the area of symptomatic breast disease and palliative care and the forthcoming recommendations of the expert group on radiotherapy services. The Department of Health and Children is in discussions with the executive of BreastCheck in relation to the expansion of the programme and, especially, the linkages with the existing symptomatic services. I am committed to the national expansion of BreastCheck at the earliest possible date.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">As regards breast cancer services generally, the Mid-Western Health Board formally adopted a report on the development of symptomatic breast disease services for the region on 8 December 2000. The board has agreed to develop its symptomatic services at Limerick Regional Hospital. The breast clinic at Limerick Regional Hospital opened in October 1998. Referral to the clinic allows rapid access to a consultant surgeon, mammography and rapid processing of results. A weekly multidisciplinary meeting commenced in June 2001 and is attended by all relevant members of the team. Two breast care nurses have been appointed to Limerick Regional Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">In relation to mammography services available to women in north Tipperary, I have been informed by the Mid-Western Health Board that these patients are now being referred to the centre of excellence at Limerick Regional Hospital. Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her general practitioner who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic service in her area.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Regional Airports.</heading>
        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_355">
          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_727">I wish to share time with Deputy Coveney.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">Recent developments regarding the future of Cork Airport are a matter of grave concern. Prior to these, everything had been going according to plan. A consultative body established by the regional authority had met Aer Rianta on several occasions, during which it was agreed that the best interests of Cork Airport lay in remaining within Aer Rianta. It was also agreed that Aer Rianta would provide the €130 million capital required for the upgrading of the airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">Suddenly, before the general election the Progressive Democrats published proposals in its election manifesto to make Cork Airport independent. These proposals were incorporated into the programme for Government and recently the  Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, announced plans to implement them as policy. This has resulted in Aer Rianta threatening to withdraw funding from Cork Airport which has caused unnecessary delays in delivering the badly needed capital investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">Even if the Minister wished to implement the policy of independence, the Government does not have the resources to do so as the Exchequer position is extremely tight. The result of the announcement, however, has been a delay in the works proceeding. The consultative body in Cork Airport has clearly stated on numerous occasions that it wants the airport to remain within the Aer Rianta group in the best interests of the airport. I implore the Minister to clarify the position in order that the necessary improvement works can proceed immediately.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_356">
          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_731">It is a shame the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, is not present. Perhaps he gets Thursday off with the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">This is a very serious issue for people in Cork, the south and Munster generally. Cork Airport is a very successful and vibrant regional and international airport. In 2001 some 1.8 million passengers used it, a figure which is projected to rise to over 2 million this year. It is a vital infrastructural asset, which brings people to and from this island and makes a significant contribution to the economy of Cork, Munster and the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">It is unacceptable that the public representatives of Cork of all parties do not know what the future plans are for Cork Airport as regards its future management and financial structure. It is even more unacceptable that the management of the airport does not appear to know what lies ahead in this regard. The airport is being run very well and breaks even or makes a profit every year. I state with confidence and without bias that it is, based on evidence, probably the best run airport in the country in terms of its marketing budget and other factors. For example, it continues to increase passenger numbers by 6% to 7% each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The Minister must provide direction and leadership. The management of the airport, public representatives and the general public in the region need to know what the future will bring for the airport. Will it remain within the Aer Rianta umbrella? It should remain in Aer Rianta, provided it is given greater independence in decision making. One of the frustrations in Cork has been that every major decision made by the airport must be approved in Dublin before it can be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">The other side of the equation is that we need the security of the Aer Rianta umbrella in order to finance the capital projects the airport requires. Deputy Murphy pointed out that the future capital plans for Cork Airport, which involve building a new terminal, are costed at  between €120 million and €130 million and rising. This money has been promised time and again, both by the Government and Aer Rianta. We need to know what the position is. The Minister has stated he plans to make Cork Airport more independent of Dublin. What will this mean? Will it be given an independent management structure within Aer Rianta or privatised?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_736">I thank Deputies Coveney and Murphy for their contributions and welcome the opportunity to respond on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. Deputy Coveney and the House should recognise that when we need leadership, there is no better man than Deputy Brennan to show it. He will do so, in particular, with regard to Cork Airport. I agree this is a serious issue. As someone who frequents Cork Airport when I visit the region, I accept that many of the Deputies comments are warranted.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The programme for Government provides that, as part of the process of continuing to transform Aer Rianta, the Government will ensure Shannon and Cork airports have greater autonomy and independence. A debate has now been stimulated by the Minister within the Shannon and Cork regions and at national level on the best ownership structure for these two airports going forward. The Minister visited both Shannon and Cork recently to further stimulate this debate and seek out the views of local interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">As the Deputies will be aware, the Minister has already made it clear that the issue of greater autonomy for Shannon and Cork airports is being considered solely in the context of continued State ownership of the airports. There is a genuine sense of goodwill towards the airports in the two regions on the part of local tourism and business interests. The Minister has already received numerous ideas and suggestions from local interests on the best ownership structure for Cork and Shannon airports which range from maintaining the current Aer Rianta structure to completely new, separate State companies to own and operate the two airports. The Minister will carefully consider the views of all interested parties before framing proposals to bring to Government and it is not appropriate at this point to speculate on what those proposals will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">Aer Rianta funds developments at Cork and Shannon from its own resources and borrowings without recourse to the Exchequer. If the ownership structure of these airports were to be revised in a fundamental way, the issue of the level and sources of funding for the airports going forward would have to be carefully assessed. Based on submissions which have been received to date, there is clearly a wide range of views on the best way forward for Cork and Shannon airports. Some interests are satisfied with the <i>status quo</i> ownership arrangement but would welcome a mechan ism to provide for a greater contribution by local interests in decision making at the airports. The Minister will listen to all parties who have views to offer on these issues and neither he nor the Government has any ideological preconceptions with regard to the matter. There is no point in changing the current ownership arrangements unless it can be shown that there are clear, positive benefits for Cork and Shannon and their surrounding areas. Whatever the outcome of his current examination of options for greater autonomy for Cork Airport, the Minister has already made it clear that Aer Rianta's development plans will proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">There is a general consensus that Cork Airport needs significant investment as a result of the growth in traffic through the airport in recent years and Aer Rianta is well advanced with its plans for a major new capital investment programme in infrastructure and facilities. The main feature of this programme, estimated to cost €130 million, will bring the capacity of the airport up to 2.5 million passengers and will facilitate further expansion thereafter to handle growth up to 5 million passengers per annum in the medium to long-term.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">Cork Airport has seen a dramatic growth in passenger traffic, which has risen by 50% since 1996 and stood at a rate of 1.8 million passengers last year. This success in passenger growth, which has continued this year with results for the first ten months showing an increase of over 5% on the same period last year, has created pressures on the airport's infrastructure and Aer Rianta's major development plan will address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The Minister wants to assure Deputies that the ownership structure decided upon for Cork Airport will be in the best interests of the airport and will facilitate continued growth. It will also serve the best interests of airlines and passengers. The implementation of the current development plan will ensure that the airport has the necessary infrastructural facilities to meet the growing traffic demands for air travel in the Cork region. Cork Airport has and will continue to contribute much to the prosperity of the surrounding regions.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Probation and Welfare Service.</heading>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_358">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_743">Donaghmede parish and the constituency of Dublin North-East are supportive of the probation and welfare service and recognise the great, valuable work it has done in recent decades. We also recognise the necessary conditions required to implement the Children Act, 2001, particularly regarding its emphasis on parental responsibility and meetings between the perpetrators of crime and their victims. As a director of northside partnership, I have been heavily involved over the past 18 months to two  years in linking up with the connect programme to train and place ex-offenders who form one of our four key target groups in the Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central constituencies. That programme presents real problems for the partnership's staff which we on the board discussed at length.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The major concern in Donaghmede and surrounding parishes, such as Ayrfield and Baldoyle, is that no consultation took place regarding this proposal among the community, their representatives and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The only planning notice was a small reference to new windows and doors at the shopping centre in Donaghmede. Where Donaghmede has been consulted in the past, as was the case with the Northern Area Health Board in relation to homes for vulnerable youngsters, the response has been generous, but in this case there was no consultation before the general election and little since with Deputy McDowell.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The key problems residents have identified at two huge meetings at Holy Trinity sports and leisure club and at Holy Trinity parish church a few days ago relate to the location of the proposed regional centre and its sheer size. At the meetings local women and families expressed concern at the placing of this centre in an enclosed shopping centre whereas around the city and country other major probation centres are based on the high street or in security or industrial areas. There was a major concern in relation to Donaghmede shopping centre in particular because Kay's Kitchen restaurant, which is run by our esteemed business people, Bert and Barney Glover, is the nearest we have to a main street in the parish and fears were expressed about the kind of things that could develop there.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">There has long been concern about the running of the shopping centre and people have asked why demands over the last two decades for a Garda station for the parish and its environs have not been met. There are no other information offices of any kind in the area, yet this major proposal for a regional centre has been put forward. There is concern about the size of a regional office which is to cover the north inner city, the Minister of State's constituency, my Dublin North-East Dublin constituency and the constituency of Dublin North. Constituents want to know why there was not liaison throughout the area with regard to centres for Swords, Malahide and Portmarnock, Donaghmede, Clontarf and for the north inner city. Why are the provisions being centred in Donaghmede, which is missing vital support services?</p>
          <p eId="para_747">We welcome the briefing that Ms Ailish Glennon and her staff gave to us at our parish church during which they courageously set forth what they wanted to do, but major concerns have been expressed regarding issues people wanted to put. My experience is that ex-offenders are div ided into three categories of low, medium and high risk and we in the northside partnership job placement centre were advised by the probation service to deal mainly with those in the first category. We have had no information, advice or consultation in relation to those matters on this occasion. Donaghmede, Ayrfield, Raheny and Baldoyle parishes are quite prepared to deal with our problem children and people who have strayed for what ever reason and to integrate them back into the community. However, there is concern about the basing of a huge regional office like this in one parish and in an enclosed shopping centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has met resident groups from the Donaghmede, Grange Abbey, Donahies, Clare Hall and Grangemore estates over recent months and there will be a 12 month review period and a review committee. However, the concern remains and people feel they are being treated like children. If there had been an up-front local proposal, the Minister of State would have found that people dealt with it generously, but our constituents do not like being treated like fools.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" eId="spk_359">
          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_749">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. In the light of the manner in which he raised it and what he said, it strikes me that there is room for improvement in planning services of this nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position on the proposals to locate a probation and welfare service local office in Donaghmede Shopping Centre. The probation and welfare service nationwide has been implementing a policy of localisation of its offices in recent years. In Dublin the service has been successful in establishing offices in Dún Laoghaire, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Finglas, Crumlin and Clondalkin. These offices are sited in local communities, alongside businesses, over shops and within industrial units. No complaint has been received by the probation and welfare service to date from any member of the public about the behaviour of those attending a local office nor has any complaint been brought to the attention of any officer of the service about the behaviour of those attending a local office.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">The premises at Donaghmede Shopping Centre were identified by the probation and welfare service and the Office of Public Works as being suitable for a probation and welfare service local office. This facility is necessary to serve the needs of Donaghmede and surrounding areas as well as for the delivery of the new obligations on the probation and welfare service for family conferencing under the recently passed Children Act, 2001. Following a lease agreement with the owners of Donaghmede Shopping Centre, planning per mission was sought and obtained earlier this year to adapt the premises to service the needs of the probation and welfare service. It is envisaged that, in time, an office may also be located in north east Dublin to cover the Swords area which is rapidly expanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">The probation and welfare service, for the most part, will deal with those attending the office on an appointment only basis to meet their obligations to the courts or if they are in crisis due to homelessness or other personal or family difficulty. Clients include those on whom the court has sought reports in order to consider the type of sanction it will impose and persons who are either on a probation or community service order from the court. In addition, parents whose children's behaviour is causing them concern often seek advice from probation and welfare service staff. Others who visit probation and welfare service local offices include lawyers, members of the Garda Síochána, other statutory and voluntary agencies and representatives of local communities. There is no reason to believe the Donaghmede office will be any different from any other local office in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">I advise the House – as Deputy Broughan said – that, at the request of Deputy Martin Brady, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently met representatives of the residents associations for the areas adjacent to Donaghmede Shopping Centre concerning the plans by the probation and welfare service to locate an office in the centre. The Minister acknowledged the views outlined at the meeting on the need for as much consultation as possible with local residents about the plans for such offices, particularly on local concerns about their possible impact on the areas in which they are sited. It is recognised that the siting of any facility which engages offenders and ex-prisoners with a view to reducing crime is always likely to raise some concerns locally. However, in the interests of addressing offending behaviour, it is essential that the State makes provision for such facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The meeting agreed that the regional manager of the probation and welfare service for the area would inform the residents associations of the proposed date of opening of the local office and also liaise with them on the formation of a monitoring group for the office which will comprise representatives of the residents, traders of the shopping centre and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It will be open to the monitoring group to seek a review by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the decision to open the office after a period of 12 months in operation. It is the intention of the Minister to take appropriate action if, in the collective opinion of the monitoring group, any change in the arrangements is needed.</p>

          <p eId="para_767">Some 53,146 farmers, representing 83% of applicants, have received their 80% advance payment totalling €150 million. This figure compares favourably with the position at this time last year when 56% of applicants had received their advance payments amounting to €75 million. Of the cases which remain unpaid, a small number are awaiting an on-farm inspection while most of the others are under query with the farmers. Cases are being cleared for payment on a daily basis as queries are resolved. I will arrange to let the Deputy have a county breakdown of paid and unpaid cases. Since 1 January, some €1.3 billion has been paid to farmers under the various premia and compensatory allowance schemes of which some €694 million relates to payments made under the 2002 schemes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_19">Under EU regulations, advance payment of 60% of bovine premium may commence on 16 October. In the case of ewe premium full payment can be made from 16 October and in the case of arable aid full entitlement may only be paid from 16 November. This year I secured EU approval to have the advance payments under the  bovine schemes increased to 80% and I also secured agreement to make a 50% payment under the arable aid scheme with effect from 16 October. These arrangements have resulted in the highest level of payments ever achieved at 16 October and are of considerable benefit to farmers.</summary>

          <p eId="para_769">Farm incomes are the subject of ongoing monitoring and analysis. My Department estimates, based on CSO data, that average income per person employed in agriculture increased by 15% in 2001 and 12% in 2000. The national farm survey produced by Teagasc shows average family farm income increased by 17% in 2001 to €15,840. This follows an increase of 22% in 2000. In 2001, the average family farm income on a full-time farm was €30,959, net compared with the average industrial wage of €25,507, gross. EUROSTAT estimates that the average farm income per full-time worker equivalent, adjusted for inflation, increased by 7.8% in Ireland in 2001. This compares to an average increase of 3.3% in the EU as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The most recent household budget survey, for 1999-2000, showed that almost 60% of farm household income comes from non-farm sources, such as off-farm employment and social welfare. The increased availability of off-farm employment opportunities in rural areas has contributed to the viability of many farm households. I have taken a keen interest in farm household income and this year I established a steering group to assess up-to-date and comprehensive data in this area. My Department chairs the group with participation from the CSO, Teagasc and the ESRI. My Department also commissioned a report from the ESRI, based on the living in Ireland survey which provided additional information on total farm household income in 1994, 1997 and 1998. An ESRI project on farm household income and viability has been funded under my Department's research stimulus fund. The EU Commission is currently preparing a regulation which is replacing the living in Ireland survey with the EU survey on income and living conditions, which is being undertaken by the CSO and which will provide data on total farm household income on an annual basis.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_20">My Department's public expenditure in 2001 amounted to €2.7 billion, a record €1,382 million of which was spent on direct payments to farmers, which accounted for 53% of aggregate farm income. Effective use has been made of mechanisms such as export refunds, intervention and internal aids to support prices and farm incomes at critical times. In the context of the mid-term  review proposals I am requesting the EU Commission to carry out an impact analysis on the proposals, especially decoupling. In that regard I expect that the impact of the proposals on farm incomes should be taken into account.</summary>

Producers who satisfy certain criteria and who had been involved in the farm modernisation scheme or the reduced interest scheme for farmers in financial difficulty during the early 1980s or who were affected by an outbreak of animal disease in their herds during the late 1970s were eligible to apply. A large volume of applications was received under this scheme and considerable progress has been made towards the finalisation of allocations. My Department will not be in a position to confirm whether individual applications are acceptable until a full assessment of the accompanying documentation in all cases has been conducted. The amount of quota to be allocated to any eligible applicant can be determined only when all eligible applications have been processed. I expect that the allocations will be made shortly. Allocations made under this scheme may be used to cover milk delivered during the 2002-03 quota year.</p>

          <p eId="para_776">I am aware of the surveillance study, undertaken by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland into the presence of e.coli 1057:H7 in minced beef and beef burgers, to which the Deputy refers. Information campaigns and control systems are in place at all abattoirs to ensure the risks associated with e.coli 1057:H7 are addressed. Veterinary examination regulations made under the Abattoirs Act, 1998 were amended to include an additional condition under which the veterinary officer in charge of slaughter plants, including cattle slaughter plants, could reject livestock for slaughter on the basis of the condition of their hide, fleece or skin. A clean livestock policy was introduced in beef slaughter plants in 1998. The policy was accompanied by extensive advertising in the agricultural press and the display of colour posters in all district veterinary offices of the Department, marts and Teagasc offices. The purpose of the advertising and poster campaigns was to alert cattle farmers in particular to the introduction of the policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">In 1999 a pilot carcase hygiene evaluation programme was undertaken in a number of plants. The purpose of the programme was to introduce a regime targeted specifically at the quality of carcase dressing in order to eliminate the problem of cross-contamination of carcases. The programme was subsequently implemented in all beef slaughter plants at the beginning of 2000. The programme is based on specific audit visits to beef slaughter plants by both regional and headquarters veterinary officers. The audit visits are in addition to the daily checks and carcase hygiene monitoring programmes undertaken in all slaughter plants by officers of my Department.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_21">Some 50% of audits were unannounced in the initial stages of the programme, but this changed in 2001 when a policy of 100% unannounced audit visits was implemented. In 2002 regional and headquarters veterinary personnel are continuing the programme of unannounced carcase hygiene audits. Audit findings are backed up by specific corrective action and enforcement measures which are implemented where required, including reduction in slaughter throughput levels, enhanced slaughter and boning hall supervision, operative retraining and enhanced quality control measures to be implemented by plant management. Where evidence of potential food safety hazards are identified in slaughter or cut ting plants officers of my Department are empowered to and utilise the legal notice procedures under the European Communities (Fresh Meat) Regulations, 1997, which may involve the immediate suspension of meat production.</summary>

          <p eId="para_779">The outline proposals which were published by the Commission on 10 July as a communication on the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy were discussed at meetings of the Council of Ministers in July, September and October.

This decision was without prejudice, <i>inter alia,</i> to the results of the mid-term reviews. The examination of the Commission's communication will, accordingly, continue in the Council of Ministers and the Commission's detailed proposals will be published in the coming months.

          <p eId="para_783">I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 76 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">I welcome the recent announcement by Teagasc that the number of students participating in third level vocational courses in agricultural and horticultural colleges has increased by almost 10% this year. The upgrading of courses to third level status is clearly proving attractive to young people interested in careers in agriculture and horticulture. That participants can progress from these certificate and diploma courses to university degree level is a significant factor in the big increase in student numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">My Department operates a number of specific measures to promote agriculture as a career. Tax incentives include 100% stock relief for young trained farmers for four years after transfer, 100% stamp duty relief on transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young trained farmers, 90% agricultural relief on capital acquisitions tax, income tax exemptions for land leased by farmers over 55 to non-connected persons and retirement relief on capital gains tax for farmers over 55. The principal non-tax relief measures in place are the installation aid scheme, which was established pursuant to the national development plan, and the early retirement scheme. A grant of €9,523 is available to young farmers under 35 years of age who became established in farming for the first time on or after 1 January 2000 under the installation aid scheme. In addition, top-up grants are also available to young farmers under both the dairy hygiene scheme and the farm waste management scheme. Under the early retirement scheme, older farmers are encouraged to retire early from farming in order to qualify for a pension which is jointly funded by the EU and the Exchequer, thereby encouraging their replacement by younger farmers able to improve, where necessary, the economic viability of agricultural holdings.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_23">The milk quota restructuring schemes have become the principal means by which producers can increase their milk quotas since the introduction of EU milk quota regulations in 2000. Accordingly, I have been able to prioritise the distribution of available quota and young producers, especially those with small quotas, have been a high priority. These schemes include a number of special concessions to younger farmers. The first is the priority allocation to new entrants of a minimum allocation of 50,000 litres. The second is the continuing priority of recent entrants, up to the age of 35, to acquire quota up to the limit of the first category, 180,000 litres. Priority to purchase available quota has also been  afforded to successors of producers, who had to sell their quotas in recent years into restructuring schemes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_24">The share of the pool to be allocated to the priority category of new and recent entrants was increased to give further assistance to the younger producers in this year's milk quota restructuring scheme. It rose from 20% to 25% of the pool available after the allocation to the two highest priority groups: successors to producers who had to sell into restructuring in the past and those who lost quota due to changes in the milk quota regime. In addition to the ongoing priority in the restructuring schemes, I also afforded particular importance to young producers in deciding on the allocation of the additional quota that I secured for Ireland as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement. During 2000 and 2001, I allocated 45 million litres of free quota, that is almost one third of the total additional quota available, to approximately 3,500 young trained dairy producers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_25">In March of this year, I introduced regulations allowing for the registration of milk production partnerships, which will provide opportunities for improving the efficiency of dairy operations and will allow for a better mix between work and family life, thereby increasing the attractiveness of dairying to younger farmers. I will shortly finalise details of a pilot scheme to allocate milk quotas to farm managers, the objective being to enhance the attractiveness of a career in farm management for those with appropriate skills and experience.</summary>

          <p eId="para_787">My Department has issued letters to 6,276 farmers notifying them of the preliminary calculation of their permitted stocking levels for the 2003 ewe premium year on foot of the commonage framework plans. In 4,183 cases there was a requirement to destock on existing levels. More than 650 farmers who had previously had quota frozen will have some restored. The remainder will have no further destocking requirement since their frozen quota already constitutes a sufficient reduction in stocking levels. The average net destocking requirement is 20 ewes per farmer.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_26">The freezing of ewe quota on some commonages is the outcome of an agreement between my Department and the EU Commission in 1998, which secured generous REP scheme payments of up to €242 per hectare to farmers with commonage. This agreement was reached at a time  when overgrazing by sheep, particularly on commonages in the west, had reached a point where the Commission had threatened to stop all REPS payments on those areas. My Department had to suspend the processing of REP scheme applications in the six western counties that included large areas of commonage. As a result of the 1998 agreement, however, an additional €7 million per year is being paid on top of the basic REP scheme payment to the 3,700 farmers with commonage land who are involved in the scheme. This represents an average annual additional payment of €1,800 per farmer and it brings the total average annual payment for REPS farmers with commonage land to €7,100.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_27">Under the 1998 agreement with the Commission, my Department and Dúchas were required to have individual framework plans prepared for each commonage. Letters have now issued to farmers with ewe quota because the framework plans have been mostly completed. Individual stocking levels have been calculated with reference to the destocking requirement of the relevant plans together with the data already held in the Department in respect of the farmers concerned. While ewe premium in 2003 will be payable only on the quota now notified to them, farmers will have a year to bring their actual stocking levels into line with these calculations and can therefore choose the most advantageous time to sell or acquire stock.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_28">The destocking arrangements are required to implement measures to protect and rejuvenate commonage areas that may be at risk because of overgrazing. They are an integral part of the 1998 agreement with the EU Commission. Any failure to implement them would put in question the generous REP scheme payments based on that agreement. Farmers who are subject to these measures, if they are not already participating in the REP scheme, must apply during 2003 to join it or a complementary national scheme to be operated by Dúchas. Any change to the 1998 agreement would have to be re-negotiated with the EU Commission. In the context of the consultative process on the REP scheme which I recently announced, the participating stakeholders will have an opportunity to discuss the matter.</summary>

          <p eId="para_789">It was with particular reference to future developments at European and international level that I originally formed the agri-food 2010  committee in June 1999. The committee's terms of reference were "to propose a strategy for the development of Irish agriculture and food over the next decade, following the agreement on Agenda 2000, and in light of the changes and challenges which are likely to evolve nationally and internationally over that period". The committee took account of the likely direction of changes in both the WTO and the CAP following Agenda 2000. The committee's main report was published in March 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">The Government's reaction to the agri-food 2010 report was published in the agri-food 2010 plan of action in August 2000. The plan of action set out a range of activities designed to strengthen and improve the ability of the Irish agri-food sector to best meet future challenges. The plan of action included 197 specific action points and a commitment to ongoing monitoring, which was further enshrined in the Department's statement of strategy for 2001-04. I published the agri-food 2010 implementation report in December 2001 to deliver on this commitment and to demonstrate the ongoing importance of the agri-food 2010 report. This report found that of the 197 action points 94% had either been successfully undertaken or had seen significant work undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">The vision of the 2010 report, to which the Government is committed, provides full and part-time farmers with every available option to achieve a viable level of farm household income and to have a sustainable future in agriculture. However, bringing about the positive vision of the agri-food 2010 report requires significant action by all players in the industry, including producers, processors and exporters. The Government's role has been to provide a sustainable environment and a support framework and the level of implementation reflects a successful carry out of that role. I am satisfied that the agri-food action plan will prepare our agri-food industry to address the challenges that may emerge from the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, EU enlargement or the WTO negotiations. I am committed to ensuring that those three strands of negotiations provide a favourable framework for the development of the Irish agri-food sectors and of rural communities into the future.</p>

The Council also decided that the total annual outlay on market-related expenditure and direct payments should not exceed the amount in real terms of the ceiling set for these expenditures for the Union of 15 for 2006 by the Berlin European Council plus the amount of these expenditures for the ten new member states in 2006, as estimated by the Commission. These two amounts, €42.8 billion and €2.5 billion respectively, total €45.3 billion which constitutes the baseline for future years. The Council decided that expenditure in nominal terms between 2007 and 2013 should be kept within the baseline increased by 1% a year. The decisions relate to a Union of 25 member states and a separate decision about funding for Bulgaria and Romania will have to be made prior to their accession, which at present is targeted for 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">The agreement reached at the Brussels European Council represents a fair and acceptable balance between all the competing interests. It also provides assurances to farmers about the availability of funding for the CAP until 2013. The decisions reached by the European Council now form part of the EU's negotiating position with the applicant countries. Final decisions are expected to be taken on terms of accession of these countries at the Copenhagen European Council meeting which is scheduled for mid-December.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_798">Ireland, in common with other EU member states, has had a comprehensive system of targeted active surveillance for BSE in place since 1 January 2001. Under current EU legislation, all fallen and casualty animals over 24 months of age and all slaughter cattle over 30 months of age are tested for the disease, using a rapid test validated by the EU Commission. Almost 675,000 animals  were tested under this regime in 2001: 246 positive cases were confirmed in that year compared with 149 in 2000, when active surveillance was not in place. Of the 246 cases, 119 were detected through active surveillance and 81 were among fallen animals which were not, in any event, intended for the food chain. Likewise for 2002, the number of cases detected through active surveillance represents 67% of the total number of cases and the bulk of these were in fallen animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The increase in the number of BSE cases resulting from the introduction of active surveillance, which was only made possible by the validation by the EU Commission of rapid tests for BSE in mid-2000, confirms that in Ireland, as in all other EU member states, the number of BSE cases was higher than the number of cases identified by passive surveillance alone. It is not possible to say with certainty what the historic difference was between the detection and the infection rates. However, I remind the Deputy that BSE controls in place for many years aimed to prevent infection, primarily through a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in feed for cattle and sheep and the protection of public health through the removal and destruction of potentially infective materials, specified risk materials, from all bovine and ovine carcases intended for the human food chain or the animal feed chain. The rapid testing of cattle at slaughter provides added protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">In relation to the source of infection, the dramatic change in the age profiles of animals confirmed with BSE in recent years clearly shows that the enhanced feed and specified risk material controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 have had a dramatic effect on the number of infections since then. Only 1% of cases diagnosed to date in 2002 were at less than six years old at the time of diagnosis compared with 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000. Some 281 of the 284 cases diagnosed so far in 2002 were born in 1996 or earlier. No cases have been diagnosed in animals born in 1998, the year from which the scientific steering committee judged Ireland's control system to be optimally stable.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">This is a positive indication that the enhanced controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 have succeeded in cutting off the source of BSE infection and that the incidence of BSE will decline as animals born prior to the introduction of those controls leave the system. Finally, Ireland's handling of all aspects of BSE is subject to ongoing scrutiny from various perspectives by independent bodies such as the EU's Food and Veterinary Office, the Food and Safety Authority of Ireland and others and has been recognised time and again as comprehensive, rigorous and responsible.</p>

          <p eId="para_810">Average grain production in Ireland over a number of years has been 2 million tonnes and it is desirable to maintain this level of production to avoid over-dependence on imported grain. Difficult weather conditions during the first half of this year created problems during the growing season for cereals. While yields were down by about 12% on recent years, production, at an estimated 1.98 million tonnes, was not far short of the average of 2 million tonnes, mainly due to a substantial increase in the area under winter wheat. This was a satisfactory outcome in view of the difficult weather conditions. Under normal conditions yields in this country are among the highest in Europe.</p>

I obtained a derogation from the EU Commission to allow set-aside land to be used for animal feed purposes on farms where 33% or more of the land has been flooded. I arranged for Teagasc to provide an intensive advisory service, both in general and on a one to one basis. In co-operation with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, I arranged that the farm assist scheme take account of the situation faced by farmers. I obtained Commission approval to bring forward the payment of 50% of arable aid due to cereal farmers to 16 October.

I am simplifying the format of the REP scheme plans for extensive farming systems. These changes will come into effect in January 2003. In addition, I had previously announced new arrangements under which all REP scheme planners are to be given the facility, with the agreement of their clients, to access and download land parcel information from my Department's land parcel identification computer system.

Based on its monitoring, my Department believes that the system is generally working well. I have, however, always made it clear that specific difficulties which flockowners may encounter will be examined with a view to resolving such difficulties within the key parameters of the system. In this context and as a result of feedback to the Department from flockowners and via farmers' representative bodies it is acknowledged that full reconciliation with the flock register may be difficult for some farmers, given the fact that the group approach to recording details in the register had been agreed. As a means of addressing this problem, I have decided that the reconciliation for 2002 should be simplified. A letter outlining full details of this adjustment in approach is being issued to all flockowners this week.</p>

My Department will be better able to address and respond to the submission once this clarification is to hand. Any further adjustments, refinements or improvements contemplated by my Department would necessarily give full weight to the  need to protect the integrity of the identification and traceability dimensions of the system, while taking account of forthcoming EU proposals. Any such further refinements would, in any event, fall to be introduced in 2003 rather than this year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_824">In the past five years the production and marketing of vegetables has undergone radical changes with the introduction of centralised distribution into Ireland. The increased importance of the retail multiple market has resulted in the concentration of supply to these outlets. The net effect has been the stabilisation of area grown for the fresh market, increased specialisation, scale and size of operational units and the exit of many smaller growers from the industry. Growers who have invested in their business to meet the requirements of retailers are those who have remained in the industry, by and large.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">Vegetable production in Ireland is mainly focused on serving domestic market fresh product requirements. Large multinational companies, that source vegetables produced at the least cost, largely manufacture processed products. Existing producers have invested heavily in the past few years to continue to compete in the fresh market. They have put in place specialist infrastructure to grow, harvest, grade, pack, cool and store their crops and this has helped them to better control shelf-life and to hold produce until market conditions have improved. Certain products are now available all year round. The capital grant schemes operated by my Department under the operational programme for rural development and under the national development plan have been very important in facilitating these infrastructural developments. Due to the dominance in sales of fresh vegetables through the retail multiples, fresh market growers will only survive if they can reach the standards required by those multiples. All supermarkets operating in Ireland must demonstrate a continued commitment to buy vegetables grown in Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_32">The development of producer organisations under EU regulations is aimed at assisting growers to meet the high standards demanded by the multiples. The objectives are to produce crops efficiently, to concentrate supply, to meet the highest quality standards and to respect environmental conditions. My Department has encouraged growers to form producer organisations and has operated an assistance scheme for them since 1998. There are now 17 recognised groups with a combined turnover of €127 million in 2001. The intention is to continue to expand the operation of producer organisations to help growers to meet  the increasing challenges of the marketplace. The production challenge for fresh vegetable growers is to maximise yields of premium grade produce and to achieve premium market prices, while using the minimum inputs to produce the crop. A secondary challenge is to maximise market share in-season and to extend the season at both ends; that is, early and late in the season. Growers who can meet these challenges have good future prospects, as long as they continually invest to improve the quality end of their business.</summary>

          <p eId="para_827">There is a downward trend in fertiliser usage by Irish farmers. Sales of fertiliser in Ireland decreased from 1.896 million tonnes in 1995-96 to 1.546 million tonnes in 2000-01, representing a reduction of 18.5%. Reductions in nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium for the corresponding period were 11.6%, 31.5% and 29.7% respectively. There are strong indications that the downward trend in fertiliser use will be reflected in the final figures for 2001-02. The 1994 introduction of the REP scheme, which requires participants to implement nutrient management plans, has contributed to the reduction in fertiliser sales in recent years. The widespread use of nutrient management planning, which requires a soil testing programme to determine the actual nutrient status of the soil, has helped to raise awareness among farmers of the importance of matching nutrient supply to crop demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Teagasc constantly reviews its recommended application rates for fertilisers in the light of national and international research findings, changes in farm practices and the onset of new grass and crop varieties with different nutrient requirements. Teagasc published its most recent fertiliser advice for grassland and tillage crops last December. The recommended application rates take into account the need to protect the environment from the consequences of excessive fertiliser use. I am confident that the latest Teagasc fertiliser recommendations strike an appropriate balance between optimising agricultural productivity and protecting the environment. I am encouraged by the findings of the recently published EPA report, Water Quality in Ireland 1998-2000, which showed that for the first time since national surveys commenced, the length of unpolluted river channel in Ireland had increased.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">I am making two administrative changes to the REP scheme which will come into effect in January 2003. The first change relates to title documentation requirements. The scheme's specification requires the planner, when drawing up an REP scheme farm plan, to satisfy himself or herself as to the applicant's title to all eligible land declared in it, whether owned or leased. Land areas declared for the scheme and all other schemes under the CAP rural development plan must be identified in accordance with the integrated administration and control system database, which is updated annually from the area aid application form.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">From January 2003, however, only land parcels declared on the database will be eligible for payment under the REP scheme, meaning that planners will no longer be required to check ownership documentation of land parcels in most cases. This change will not apply to leased land or commonage land. Where leased land, excluding commonage or grazing rights, is declared for an REP scheme payment, the planner must continue to make sure that the unexpired period of the lease is long enough to satisfy the conditions of the scheme. Stringent EU conditions of approval for payment on commonage land mean that planners must continue to satisfy themselves about ownership of shares.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The second change I am making is the introduction of a revised and simplified version of the REP scheme plan that will be more suitable for extensive farming systems. The simplified plan will enable the farmer's REP scheme planner to set out clearly an annual programme of works under each of the existing scheme measures, in a straightforward way which will leave no room for doubt about the programme of works to be delivered during the course of the REP scheme agreement. Qualifying farmers may still choose the more comprehensive plan format if they wish. While the administrative changes do not affect the commitments and undertakings that a farmer must enter into under the REP scheme, the new procedures will simplify the application process and make the plan more relevant to extensive farming systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">In a separate initiative to streamline the application process, all REP scheme planners will be given the facility, with the agreement of their client farmers, to access and download land parcel information from my Department's land parcel information system. This will enable planners to quickly identify and map farms when farmers identify their land parcels in connection with their REP scheme applications.</p>

      <b>Mr. Ring</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Agriculture and Food</b>
      the number of herd owners in County Mayo who were instructed to destock their sheep numbers recently; the number of sheep which have to be destocked in total from Mayo; the figures for each county affected; and if he will provide maps of all the areas affected.

          <p eId="para_835">Notifications of preliminary calculations setting out the ewe stocking level and ewe quotas that farmers with commonage land may retain for  2003 have issued to 1,551 farmers in County Mayo. There is a destocking requirement, in 1,381 cases, of a net total of 24,432 ewes. The table below sets out the position nationally and includes the figures for County Mayo. It would be a time consuming and costly exercise to provide a copy of all of each of the over 2,500 maps involved. My Department has published details of all framework plans completed to date, including maps, on the Internet at www.commonage.agriculture.gov.ie , for the benefit of farmers and planners.</p>

It is a highly attractive and effective measure. Changes in the conditions of the REP scheme included in the development plan will require formal amendments at EU level. I have recently announced details of a consultative process on the scheme, from which I intend to make comprehensive proposals to the Commission in 2003. The review will cover all aspects of the scheme, including payment rates, its structure, individual measures, controls and penalties. Full consultation and detailed preparation are necessary to ensure that proposals that may be put to the Commission in 2003 are robust and fully justifiable within the terms of the relevant EU regulations. As a first step in the process I have invited written submissions from stakeholder groups to form the basis of further consultations, including a forum in which those who have made submissions may participate collectively. Following these two stages of consultation, my Department will formulate proposals on the REP scheme by mid-2003 to be submitted to the European Commission.</p>

          <p eId="para_1109">The traceability elements of the national beef assurance scheme have been fully operational since 1 January 2000. It was envisaged that other elements of the scheme, in particular the inspection and approval of farms, would be undertaken this year in conjunction with the annual round of testing and detailed discussions to this end took place with the veterinary and farming representative organisations over a long period. A protocol for the conduct of the inspections was agreed. Only a small number of inspections have taken place to date, however, as a result of resistance to implementation of the scheme mainly by veterinarians whose union is seeking a centralised payment system for the costs involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">The legislation establishing the national beef assurance scheme clearly provides that the costs of securing a certificate of approval are the responsibility of the applicant. The Exchequer has already invested in excess of €45 million in developing the traceability system that underpins the scheme and costs will continue to be incurred under this heading. The scheme is an important element in the drive to maintain and increase the marketplace in a difficult sector and I am disappointed about the impasse that has developed in relation to its implementation.</p>

It was suspended in 2001 due to the foot and mouth disease emergency. It was intended to have a new round of inspections in 2002 but this has not proved feasible and it is clear that the designated closing date cannot be met. It has, therefore, been decided that the specified closing date of 31 December 2002 will not apply. It is my intention, however, that inspections will be carried out in 2003 and a closing date will be prescribed when those arrangements are put in place.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1112">The United Kingdom continues to be our most important market for beef. Some 150,000 tonnes of Irish beef were exported there in the first nine months of this year and it is estimated that this figure will have risen to almost 250,000 tonnes by the end of the year. This compares favourably with exports to the UK in 2001, which totalled some 210,000 tonnes. The corresponding figure was 110,000 tonnes in 2000 and 95,000 tonnes in 1999. The main contributor to the dramatic increase in exports to the UK over the past two years has been the reduced domestic supplies of UK beef due to the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001.</p>

It is vital that those involved in the agriculture sector, not just in Ireland but across the European Union, should learn the lessons of the 2001 outbreak. In this context, I assure the Deputy that my Department is anxious to learn from the experiences not just in the United Kingdom, but also in other member states.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_36">My officials and I have assisted in a review of the crisis by the foot and mouth disease subcommittee of the European Parliament. At  national level, my Department held a seminar in November 2001 to draw on the practical operational experiences of people involved in managing the crisis in Ireland at all levels, not just from my Department but from other agencies such as the Garda Síochána, the Customs and Excise authorities, local authorities and colleagues from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in the North. This seminar marked the first step in a comprehensive, thorough and exhaustive process of evaluation, which is now concluding. This will result in the publication of a comprehensive operations manual as a template for action for those involved in a future foot and mouth disease outbreak, from field staff to policy makers at departmental headquarters.</summary>

In so far as Northern Ireland is concerned, I believe that considerable progress has been made on the development of an all-island animal health strategy under arrangements established in the Good Friday Agreement. The detailed issues are being taken forward at official level by a number of policy working groups. An all-island animal health strategy, properly implemented, will be of real benefit to all involved in agriculture, North and South, in managing future threats to our animal health status, whether from foot and mouth disease or any other quarter. The foot and mouth disease experience last year left no doubt that a joint approach to animal health issues on this island is necessary if we are to successfully manage such matters in the future.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1116">In Ireland there have been three confirmed cases of BSE in cattle born after 1996. I do not consider this to be a matter of serious concern. In recent years there has been a significant shift in the age profile of BSE cases which indicates clearly the effectiveness of our controls. The number of five year old cases detected to date this year is significantly down on last year's level of 38. A total of 99% of cases diagnosed to date in 2002 were at least six years old at the time of diagnosis compared with 84% in 2001 and 60% in 2000. In terms of case numbers, 281 of the 284 cases diagnosed to date in 2002 were born in 1996 or earlier. No cases have been diagnosed in animals born in 1998, the year from which the scientific steering committee judged Ireland's control system to be optimally stable.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_38">I am satisfied that a comprehensive range of measures is in place to protect consumers and for the control and eradication of BSE. These include compulsory notification of the disease, depopulation of herds, tracing and slaughter of birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animal, a ban on the use of meat and bone meal for farmed animals and removal and destruction of specified risk materials from ruminant animals. The testing of all animals over 30 months of age prior to slaughter provides further protection. Ireland's approach to BSE has been characterised by more rigorous measures that, in many instances, were put in place earlier than required by EU legislation. The purpose of the control programme is to protect human health by maintaining high standards of food safety and animal health and welfare, to safeguard the economically important beef industry and, in due course, to eradicate the disease from the national herd. Ireland's measures to deal with BSE have been independently scrutinised by bodies such as the EU Food and Veterinary Office and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and have been found time and again to be comprehensive, rigorous and reliable.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1118">I raised the question of the simplification of the EU penalty regime at a Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in October 2000. An EU working group was subsequently established to examine appropriate changes to the control requirements under the various schemes with a view to ensuring a greater degree of simplification and proportionality. The examination concluded in November last year and a new regulation, published in December 2001, took effect from 1 January this year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_39">I propose to mention the main changes that have been introduced. A farm based approach to bovine livestock inspections has led to a reduction of over 50% in the number of on-farm inspections. Reduced penalties have been introduced for the late lodgement of area aid applications involving permanent pasture. Producers may lodge applications up to 1 July each year with a 50% reduction in penalties. There are no penalties for the over-declaration of a forage area where there is sufficient area to support the stocking density for the livestock schemes concerned. Farmers who omit to include land parcels on their original area aid applications can add the parcels to their applications until 31 May each year. Obvious errors on applications can be corrected without a penalty.

          <p eId="para_1120">The policy of total herd depopulation which has been in place since 1989 has served Ireland extremely well in terms of international markets, helping to maintain access which otherwise could have been denied. The basis for the current herd depopulation policy is primarily to facilitate the certification of meat and milk products for third country markets. In this regard the comprehensive range of BSE controls, including the depopulation policy, has been useful as an effective tool to regain a foothold in third country markets which had been closed to beef from the EU. I am keeping the depopulation policy, which is quite expensive, under very careful review. However, I have no proposals at this stage to deviate from the current arrangements.</p>

          <p eId="para_1123">One of the key requirements for full-time farmers is to increase their farm size. As only a minute proportion of land is sold each year, land leasing is the main option for farmers wishing to increase farm size and to improve viability. It is essential however that leases are available for the medium to long-term rather than on conacre thus allowing farmers to plan for the future.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_41">The agri-food 2010 report recommends that tax incentives should be introduced for intra-family farm leases where the lessor is a participant in the early retirement scheme. The committee also recommended that €2,540 of rental income is exempted from the means test for the non-contributory old age pensions and other social welfare benefits. The programme for Government also contains a commitment to give urgent consideration to the potential for tax incentives for long-term leasing of land as a means of increasing the supply of land available to young farmers. Currently land leasing is mainly encouraged by the early retirement scheme which allows retiring  farmers transfer their land by lease and the rural environment protection scheme which is payable on land leased in by farmers.</summary>

It comes against the background of the foot and mouth disease crisis, which brought into clear focus the possible risk to animal health arising from mixing of animals from different points of origin at such premises. The proposal is complex and has implications for practical arrangements for the export of animals from Ireland and other member states. It is receiving attention at EU Council working group level in Brussels.

The report found that of the 197 action points in the agri-food 2010 plan of action, 94% had either been successfully undertaken or had seen significant work undertaken.

          <p eId="para_1132">I am satisfied that a comprehensive range of measures is in place for the control and eradication of BSE, including compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of herds, the tracing and slaughter of birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animal, a ban on the use of meat and bone meal for farmed animals and removal and destruction of specified risk materials from ruminant animals. It has been a characteristic of Ireland's approach to BSE that we have adopted measures which have been more rigorous and in many instances in place earlier than are required by EU legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_42">As part of the response to the increasing incidence of BSE across Europe in late 2000, and the resultant crisis in consumer confidence, the European Commission introduced legislation requiring member states to use newly validated rapid tests to conduct active surveillance for BSE. From 1 January 2001, member states were required to test all animals over 30 months of age intended for human consumption, all casualty animals over 24 months of age and a random sample of fallen animals over 24 months of age. From 1 June 2001, this requirement was expanded to cover all fallen animals over 24 months of age. In 2001, 674,633 rapid BSE tests were conducted in Ireland. As expected, this resulted in an increase in the num ber of BSE positive animals, with 246 positives confirmed in 2001 compared with 149 in 2000. Of the 246 BSE cases in 2001, 119 were identified through active surveillance, 81 of which were among the fallen animal cohort, which would never have been intended for the human food chain in any event. This rise in numbers has continued in 2002, with 284 cases identified to the week ended 31 October 2002. This includes two cases in animals from depopulated herds. Some 192 of the cases have been identified through active surveillance and 160 of these cases have been in fallen animals.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_43">In recent years there has been a shift in the age profile of BSE cases towards the older age categories which indicates clearly the effectiveness of our controls. About 99% of cases diagnosed to date in 2002 were at least six years old at the time of diagnosis compared with 84% in 2001 and 60% in 2000. In terms of case numbers, 281 of the 284 cases diagnosed so far in 2002 were born in 1996 or earlier. No cases have been diagnosed in animals born in 1998, the year from which the scientific steering committee judged Ireland's control system to be optimally stable or capable of preventing the spread of disease. Ireland's measures to deal with BSE have been independently scrutinised by bodies such as the EU Food and Veterinary Office and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and have been found time and again to be comprehensive, rigorous and reliable.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1143">The decision to freeze ewe quota on some commonages, which was communicated to farmers recently, arises from a 1998 agreement between my Department and the EU Commission, which secured generous REP scheme payments of up to €242 per hectare to farmers with commonage. This agreement was reached at a time when overgrazing by sheep, particularly on commonages in the west, had reached a point where the Commission had threatened to stop all payments under the scheme in those areas. My Department had to suspend the processing of REP scheme applications in the six western counties that included large areas of commonage. As a result of the 1998 agreement, however, an additional €7 million per year is paid on top of the basic REP scheme payment to the 3,700 farmers with commonage land who participate in the scheme. This represents an average annual additional payment of €1,800 per farmer and it brings the total average annual payment for REP scheme farmers with commonage land to €7,100.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">Under the 1998 agreement with the Commission, my Department, with Dúchas, was required to have individual framework plans prepared for each commonage. Now that the framework plans have been mostly completed, individual stocking levels have been calculated with reference to the destocking requirement of the relevant plans together with the data already held in the Department in respect of the farmers concerned. The destocking arrangements are required to implement measures to protect and rejuvenate commonage areas that may be at risk because of overgrazing. They are an integral part of the agreement that was secured in 1998. Failure to implement them would call into question the generous payments based on that agreement. Farmers who are subject to these measures, but who are not already participating in the REP scheme, must apply during 2003 to join the scheme or a complementary national scheme to be operated by Dúchas.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_45">It has been clear since the agreement with the Commission was negotiated in 1998 that when the commonage framework plans were completed, stocking levels would have to be adjusted in line with the actual destocking requirements in the plans. Indeed the farming organisations have pressed repeatedly for the completion and publication of the plans at the earliest possible date.  The implications of the framework planning process have been widely discussed over the years and in February of this year the destocking requirement for the vast majority of commonages was published on my Department's website and received considerable publicity. Any change to the 1998 agreement would have to be renegotiated with the EU Commission. The participating stakeholders will have an opportunity to discuss the matter in the context of the consultative process on the REP scheme which I recently announced.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1151">I established the food labelling group in July this year to examine issues relating to the labelling of food, including the issue of origin. I was anxious to ensure that consumers get the most comprehensive information possible on the food supply, thereby enabling them to exercise their rights when making choices about which food products to buy. The expert group, which has 19 members, is widely representative of all the major stakeholders in the food chain, including the FSAI, and has been examining these issues since its inaugural meeting on 29 August. The group is on course to complete its report by the end of the month. I expect that the report will include recommendations on compulsory labelling of origin within the EU legislative framework.</p>

          <p eId="para_1153">The national pig identification and tracing system was launched last July, when a new registration and identification programme involving tagging, slap marking and movement documentation was implemented. The system covers all pig herds in the country. The second element of the programme, the notification of all movements of pigs to a central database to provide full national traceability, was implemented a month later. The notification system, which is paperless, has been designed to be user-friendly. Both  elements of the scheme are operating very successfully and the speed with which producers, processors and others have adapted to it is evidence of a clear commitment on behalf of the pig sector to maintaining high standards of identification and traceability and an understanding of the importance of these elements in terms of disease control and consumer assurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">The successful implementation of the identification and tracing elements has made possible the roll-out of the national Aujeszky's disease eradication programme, which involves blood-testing of all 1,700 pig herds in the country. Within months the testing will provide a platform from which to begin eradicating the disease from the national pig herd. This meets a long standing demand from the sector and will protect our pig exports and facilitate the further development of the Irish pigmeat sector.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_46">Egypt, which had been Ireland's most important export market for beef, imposed a ban on European beef imports following the BSE crisis in mainland Europe late in 2000. Intensive efforts since then at Government level politically, diplomatically and technically resulted in the Egyptian authorities reopening their market to Irish beef imports in October 2001. The decision by the Egyptian authorities to lift the ban on Irish beef imports was a welcome development for the Irish cattle and beef sectors. The recent introduction of a special export refund rate of up to 30% above the normal level should help Irish exporters regain a strong presence on this important and traditional market for Irish beef.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1185">The implications for Ireland's animal health status of unregulated imports of animal based products, including those in personal baggage, was highlighted during the foot and mouth disease crisis. Indeed, both the foot and mouth outbreak in Britain in 2001, and the classical swine fever outbreak which preceded it in late 2000, may have been associated with the feeding of illegally imported food products to pigs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">Against this background, in July 2002 I introduced the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966 (Control on Animal Products) Order, 2002 (S.I. No. 390 of 2002). In relation to personal baggage allowances from EU member states, the order imposes a maximum weight limit of ten kg and a number of specific requirements regarding origin of the product. In the case of personal baggage from third countries, allowances are limited to a maximum of one kg of powdered infant milk, infant food or special food required for medical reasons, provided such products are shelf-stable proprietary brands in unbroken packages, honey and other edible bee products, snails, frogs legs and fish or fishery products, provided they come from EU approved establishments.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_49">In relation to commercial imports, the order provides that animal products being imported into the State must at least be accompanied by a  commercial document and bear a health mark or be authorised for import under licence from my Department. In addition the order prohibits the declaration of animal based products which form a part of a consignment as "groupage". Such products must be specifically declared as animal products. Additional requirements such as health certificates may also be requested. These requirements are additional to normal intra community veterinary trade rules.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_50">Products imported, either for personal or commercial use, in breach of the provisions of this order may be seized and destroyed. Furthermore, persons importing products in breach of the order are committing an offence and may be liable for prosecution under the relevant provisions of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1188">A total of 284 cases of BSE have been confirmed to date in 2002, including two cases from depopulated herds. Details of the counties and the numbers by month, excluding cohorts, will be circulated in the Official Report. While it is not possible accurately predict the numbers of cases for the remainder of the year, it is expected that they will be lower than last years numbers for the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">In recent years there has been a significant shift in the age profile of BSE cases which indicates clearly the effectiveness of our controls. In this regard, 99% of cases diagnosed to date in 2002 were at least six years old at the time of diagnosis compared with 84% in 2001 and 60% in 2000. In terms of case numbers, 281 of the 284 cases diagnosed to date in 2002, were born in 1996 or earlier. No cases have been diagnosed in animals born in 1998, the year from which the scientific steering committee judged Ireland's control system to be optimally stable.</p>

          <p eId="para_1617">Recent data from the Central Statistics Office indicate that aggregate farm income has recovered following a number of difficult years in the late 1990s.

          <p eId="para_1620">My Department, various State agencies and the industry itself all have a role in promoting the production of quality beef. To this end, the introduction of the national beef assurance scheme some years ago helped to restore consumer confidence in beef and to meet ongoing changes in consumer demands. Key elements of this scheme are the institution of a system of traceability and identification of all cattle and the development of standards of excellence in both production and processing. This scheme is compulsory and it underpins the voluntary beef quality assurance scheme operated so successfully for many years by Bord Bia. I believe that these schemes give us an advantage over other member states of the EU in that we have a framework for the delivery of assurances to consumers and customers about our rigorous controls and the quality of our product.</p>
          <p eId="para_1621">My Department also has a number of livestock improvement schemes in place. Major responsibilities in this area have been transferred in recent years to the ICBF, which has made major progress since its establishment in encouraging and promoting better breeding practices. Teagasc has a very significant role in this area also both in relation to research and advice to farmers and has been highly successful in its endeavours over the years. The development of a large suckler herd is an important advantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1622">I have also used some of the funds available from the national envelope under Agenda 2000 to encourage and reward quality beef production. For example, one third of the national envelope is used to top-up the slaughter premium on beef breed heifers and a further third is used to encourage a more rapid replacement of suckler cows in order to improve the overall quality of the breeding herd.</p>
          <p eId="para_1623">The major responsibility for the production of quality beef, however, rests with the industry itself. In the final analysis, producers decisions on cattle breeding and husbandry practices are governed by financial considerations and, unless producers are rewarded for quality, the industry will not have an adequate supply of high quality beef to meet the growing demand in the European Union. The reality is that, if the industry wants to move up the value chain and increase its presence on the European market, it needs to put in place a price structure which rewards quality.</p>

          <p eId="para_1625">The report of the advisory committee on the role of women in agriculture published in September 2000 contains 36 recommendations, covering a broad area, which includes education and training, information technology and social inclusion. Recommendations in the report have since been incorporated into the national plan for women recently published by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1626">In pursuit of individual recommendations my Department co-ordinated an interdepartmental group who examined the matter of PRSI for farm spouses. This group reported in February 2002 and possible options to resolve the issue have been notified to farming organisations. As regards other recommendations within the remit of my Department the following is the position. Funding has been provided under the Leader national rural development programme to grant aid the network of women in agriculture, which is being promoted by Macra na Feirme through a series of nationwide public meetings. The Leader programmes have identified sustainable income earning and job creating projects for women as priority for grant aid. Teagasc with the assistance of the information society fund has developed on-line curriculum and resource material for farmer IT training. The project was instigated in order to address the specific needs of farmers in relation to IT training which was identified by the advisory committee. During the past three years, some 400 computer training courses were attended by 5,000 rural dwellers and 60% of these were women. In relation to the advisory services, it is Teagasc policy to invite farmers and their spouse-partner to all Teagasc events.  The opportunities for farm families programme, which was introduced in 2001, is a major initiative, which specifically targets both partners on family farms along with the likely successor, and women are playing an active part in the programme. Some 3,500 families will participate in this programme this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_1629">I am fully committed to providing services in an efficient, effective and user-friendly manner and this has been highlighted in a series of customer service action plans. In that context, application forms and scheme terms and conditions are reviewed regularly and have been sim plified to the greatest degree possible and considerable investment has been made in information technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_1630">I recently announced that new arrangements will be introduced in 2003 for establishing stocking density on the holdings of farmers who wish to apply for extensification premium. These new arrangements, involving the maximum use of computerised databases, will significantly simplify the procedure for applying for extensification premium and greatly reduce paperwork for farmers in accordance with commitments in my Department's Customer Service Action Plan 2001-2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1631">Earlier this year my Department also established an external regional panel of customers who are participating in the special beef premium scheme in order to devise further possible ways of simplifying the application procedure on that scheme. The work of this panel is still on going. This process will be extended to other areas and/or other schemes next year and will be developed generally as the need arises.</p>
          <p eId="para_1632">The CMMS, cattle movement monitoring system, is also being developed on an ongoing basis to increase the data collected on bovines to assist applicants in their participation in certain schemes. In processing applications, my Department must at all times act in accordance with its obligations under relevant national and EU legislation. However, I am anxious to continue to review the various regulations to see if further improvements can be made there. It is for this reason that in An Agreed Programme for Government there is an undertaking to agree a series of proposals with the farming organisations to tackle red tape and to argue strongly for the adoption of the proposals at EU level.</p>

          <p eId="para_1635">It is my policy and that of the Government to ensure that Irish exporters have unrestricted access to markets worldwide and efforts at diplomatic, political and technical levels have been made and continue to be made by my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia to bring this about.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_53">Following the BSE crisis late in 2000, many third country markets imposed bans on imports of European beef. It has been my experience that  where restrictions on Irish exports of beef exist because of concerns about BSE, the most effective way of addressing this has been to underpin political and diplomatic pressure by demonstrating in practice to the relevant experts from those countries the controls throughout the sector. This approach was adopted successfully in relation to Russia and Egypt and is being continued with regard to a number of other potentially significant markets.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_54">My Department, with the assistance of Bord Bia, recently hosted a conference in Dublin on food safety and consumer protection in the beef sector aimed specifically at important markets in the Gulf region. The conference, which was attended by veterinary and food safety experts from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, afforded the visiting experts from those Gulf states the opportunity to assess the level and effectiveness of Ireland's BSE controls and I am pleased to say that reaction to the conference has been very positive. We are also in ongoing contact with the South African, Philippines and Indonesian authorities at technical and diplomatic level with a view to having those markets reopened to Irish beef.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_55">Exports of lamb last year were marginally up on the previous year's levels. France is the principal export market for Irish lamb, with over 80% of Irish exports destined for that market. Marketing efforts are continuing with Portugal, Italy and Spain and as peak demand in these markets is for the Christmas period it is expected that returns from those markets will increase at that time. Lamb exports to Germany and Belgium have maintained consistent levels. All markets to which Irish pigmeat has traditionally been exported are currently open. Japan and Korea were reopened this year following protracted negotiations aimed at lifting the bans imposed because of foot and mouth disease. Other countries such as Hong Kong, South Africa, USA and Russia were brought back before the end of 2001.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_56">My Department is engaged in attempting to negotiate access to new markets such as China and Australia. The extent to which such countries are willing to engage in such negotiations or to accept product varies, as do the procedures to be followed in each case. I am conscious of the importance to the pig industry here of having access to as wide a range of markets as possible and to this end my Department will continue to pursue this issue with all countries offering realistic prospects for trade.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1640">Letters have issued to 6,276 farmers notifying them of the preliminary calculation of their permitted stocking levels for the 2003 ewe premium year on foot of the commonage framework plans. In 4,183 cases there was a requirement to destock on existing levels. More than 650 farmers who had previously had quota frozen will have some restored. The remainder will have no further destocking requirement since their frozen quota already constitutes a sufficient reduction in stocking levels. The average net destocking requirement is 20 ewes per farmer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1641">The freezing of ewe quota on some commonages is the outcome of an agreement between my Department and the EU Commission in 1998, which secured generous REPS payments of up to €242 per hectare to farmers with commonage. This agreement was reached at a time when overgrazing by sheep, particularly on commonages in the west, had reached a point where the Commission had threatened to stop all REPS payments on those areas. My Department had had to suspend the processing of REPS applications in the six western counties that included large areas of commonage. As a result of the 1998 agreement with the Commission, however, an additional €7 million per year is now being paid on top of the basic REPS payment to the 3,700 farmers with commonage land who are in REPS. This represents an average annual additional payment of €1,800 per farmer and it brings the total average annual payment for REPS farmers with commonage land to €7,100.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_57">Under the 1998 agreement with the Commission, my Department together with Dúchas was required to have individual framework plans prepared for each commonage. Letters have now issued to farmers with ewe quota because the framework plans have been mostly completed. Individual stocking levels have been calculated with reference to the destocking requirement of the relevant plans together with the data already held in the Department in respect of the farmers concerned. While ewe premium in 2003 will be payable only on the quota now notified to them farmers will have a year to bring their actual stocking levels into line with these calculations and can therefore choose the most advantageous time to sell or acquire stock.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_58">The destocking arrangements are required to implement measures to protect and rejuvenate commonage areas that may be at risk because of overgrazing. They are an integral part of the agreement with the EU Commission secured in 1998. Any failure to implement them would put in question the generous payments based on that agreement.

          <p eId="para_1645">I have discussed this issue at the Council of Agriculture Ministers. The EU is currently in negotiations with its WTO trading partners on the question of applying tariff quotas to imports of cereals into the Union. These negotiations have arisen due to a defect in the reference price system used to calculate import duties, which has allowed cereals to enter the Union from Black Sea ports, in particular from Russia and the Ukraine, at very low prices. This has resulted in disruption of EU markets and has created uncertainty for both cereal farmers and the grain trade. Earlier this year I wrote to Commissioner Fischler expressing my concern about this situation and I urged him to take urgent remedial action. I am hopeful that a satisfactory solution will emerge from the negotiations I have referred to, in the near future.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_64">Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, there are schemes of investment aid in the commercial horticulture and the potato sectors, for which €24.6 million has been allocated over that period. Some 275 projects involving grant aid of €7 million were approved under the first round of these schemes, which will conclude shortly. Also under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 my Department operates a capital investment scheme for marketing and processing of agricultural products, which includes horticultural and potato products. A total of €25 million has been allocated over the duration of this scheme. Grant aid of €4 million was awarded to 20 horti cultural projects in these sectors in the first round of the scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_65">An EU funded scheme of aid for producer organisations is also in operation under which my Department encourages horticultural producers to come together to form groups with the aim of improving quality, concentrating supply and reducing costs of products while respecting environmental conditions. At present there are 17 recognised groups representing growers with an estimated output in 2001 of €127 million. Aid of some €3 million was paid to producer organisations in 2002 and this will increase significantly in future years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_66">My Department also provides funding to An Bord Glas and Teagasc to assist in the development of the sector. An Bord Glas operates a quality assurance programme for growers to ensure that produce is of a high standard acceptable to consumers and also carries out promotional activities. Producers can avail of research and training into improved production which is carried out by Teagasc. In addition, quality standards for fruit and vegetables set down in EU regulations are monitored at retail, wholesale and import stages by inspectors of my Department.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1691">Further beef exports to Egypt are now a commercial matter for the industry. The recent introduction of a special EU export refund rate for Egypt which is 30% above the normal level should be of major help in allowing Irish exporters regain a strong presence on this important market. I have made it clear to the industry here that I believe a longer term perspective should be taken in relation to this particular market in view of its importance as a major importer and that the opportunity now presented by the reopening of the market and the introduction of an exceptionally high refund level should not be lost.</p>

          <p eId="para_1693">The Central Statistics Office is responsible for the collection of statistics in relation to imports of beef and other animal based products. Its statistics indicate that in 2001, a total of 8,385 tonnes of beef were imported from third coun tries and that between 1 January 2002 and 31 July, 2002, the latest date for which statistics are available, the equivalent figure was 2,922 tonnes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1694">Under EU harmonised rules, beef imports into the European Union from third countries must have been produced in premises and in countries which are approved by the European Commission and which are subject to veterinary audits by the EU's food and veterinary office. In addition, such imports are subject to checks laid down in harmonised rules prescribed at European level, and must be accompanied by veterinary health certification from the authorities in the country of export, regardless of the point of entry into the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_1695">Animal-based products imported directly into Ireland from third countries must be processed through one of the approved border inspection posts at Dublin and Cork Ports, or at Dublin and Shannon Airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1696">On the question of labelling and traceability, operators marketing beef in the EU are required to label their beef with a reference number or code identifying the animal or group of animals from which the beef was derived, the name of the third country and the approval number of the slaughterhouse at which the animal or group of animals was slaughtered, the name of the third country and the approval number of the cutting hall at which the carcass or group of carcasses was cut, and the name of the third country where the animal was born, reared and slaughtered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1697">In response to growing concern relating to food labelling, I have established a group to examine the current labelling framework in the context of consumers' expectations and, in particular, to identify whatever gaps there are either in existing legislation or the manner in which it is implemented. I expect this group to report in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1698">Finally, it will be appreciated that Ireland's beef sector benefits substantially from the trade opportunities which result from our membership of the European Union and the World Trade Organisation. For example, exports of Irish beef in 2001 were valued in excess of €780 million. Reciprocal trade is an inevitable consequence of our membership of these organisations, and subject to the application of EU law in relation to veterinary health and other matters, has to be facilitated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1699">However, the rules that are in place within the framework of EU legislation are designed to ensure that neither human and animal health are compromised. I have on numerous occasions requested the Commission to ensure that the rules in place continue to provide such assurance.</p>

          <p eId="para_1704">Compensation to farmers whose herds were depopulated as a result of foot and mouth disease in the Cooley Peninsula was paid on the basis of the market value of the animals, in accordance with the relevant legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1705">Some 280 flocks and herds were depopulated on the Cooley Peninsula in the course of the cull. In so far as sheep were concerned, valuations were carried out to fix a market value on each flock as the basis for compensation provided by law. Initial valuations tended to conform with ready reckoners used by the Department's own valuers. As matters progressed it became necessary for outside valuers to be drawn in to speed up the whole process. Their valuations were seen by local flockowners as more generous than valuations carried out by Department personnel. Roughly speaking, those whose animals were taken in the latter part of the exercise tended to be satisfied, while flockowners whose animals were valued and taken at an earlier stage felt aggrieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1706">Following earlier exchanges with IFA at local level, it was agreed that the cases of flockowners who fell into this category would be reviewed. This led to a review of 182 cases in April-May 2001. This exercise resulted in supplementary payments being made in 148 (81%) of these cases. Individual supplementary payments ranged from £80 to £22,535 and totalled £415,000. This was additional to payments of some IR£3.4 million already made to the flockowners in question on foot of the initial valuations.</p>

          <p eId="para_1712">Under the 1998 agreement with the European Commission which enabled payments of up to €242 per hectare to be made to farmers on commonage land in REPS, my Department together with Dúchas was required to have individual framework plans prepared for each commonage. Now that the framework plans have been mostly completed, farmers have been notified of their individual stocking levels for 2003. These have been calculated with reference to the destocking requirement of the relevant plans together with the data already held in the Department in respect of the farmers concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1713">Farmers with commonage now have three options. They can accept the recommended destocking, have it checked by an agricultural consultant (to see whether the Department has applied the relevant framework plan correctly), or opt out of using their commonages altogether and claim no area-based or REPS payments on the commonage. (They will then not be subject to the destocking recommendations, though they must follow any environmental requirements in the relevant framework plans.)</p>

        <summary eId="sum_70">The option chosen will have a direct bearing on final allocation of quota on an individual basis for 2003, and it is in the interest of farmers to indicate their choice at the earliest possible date to avoid delays in the processing of 2003 payments.</summary>

The calculation in his case results in a destocking of 33 out of a total of 77.37 ewe equivalents on the holding. As sheep are first to be destocked under the framework plans, theoretically this would result in the freezing of his entire ewe quota. However the rules for the implementation of the framework plans provide that on mixed farms, where an undertaking is given that cattle will not be grazed on the commonage, the farmer can have his or her quota calculated on the basis of his ewe numbers and commonage area only. If the person named takes this option it will result in a reduction of approximately 15 ewes. In any event, no farmer will be required to destock to below ten ewe quota.</p>

          <p eId="para_1726">I remain fully committed to the principles of the national sheep identification system (NSIS), which provides the means by which each individual animal in the national flock can be identified and traced from birth to carcass, with ensuing benefits in areas such as disease monitoring and control, consumer assurance, flock management, etc. Based on its own monitoring my Department believes that the NSIS is generally working well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1727">I have, however, always made it clear that specific difficulties which flockowners may encounter will be examined with a view to resolving such difficulties within the key parameters of the system. In this context and as a result of feedback to the Department from flockowners and via farmer representative bodies it is acknowledged that a full reconciliation with the flock register may be difficult for some farmers given the fact that the "group" approach to recording of details in the register had been agreed. To address this problem I have decided that the reconciliation for 2002 should be simplified. A letter outlining full details of this adjustment in approach is being issued to all flockowners this week.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_72">My Department is also examining a submission received on 11 October 2002 from the Irish Farmers' Association suggesting certain adjustments to  the NSIS. Clarification on a number of points, in particular on the traceability element which is particularly important in terms of disease control and monitoring, has been sought from the IFA. My Department will be better able to assess and respond to the submission once such clarification is to hand.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_73">Any further adjustments, refinements or improvements which might be contemplated by my Department will give due weight to the necessity to protect the integrity of both the identification and traceability dimensions of NSIS and to take account of forthcoming proposals from the EU. Any such refinements, would, in any event, fall to be introduced in 2003 rather than this year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1730">An agreement signed with Libya in June 2000 provided that Ireland would be officially listed as a source country for all Libyan tenders for the supply of live cattle. Since then, however, the Libyan Foreign Minister indicated that it had not been possible to import live cattle because of what he called logistical problems and that Libya would buy beef directly. Libya subsequently issued tenders for the supply of beef and Ireland was included in the list of countries invited to tender. I understand that a number of Irish companies submitted bids at that time. Efforts at diplomatic and technical level are continuing to ensure that the agreement – in so far as it relates to cattle exports – signed with Libya is fully implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_1731">With regard to live cattle exports to Egypt the position is that proposals for a trial shipment of live cattle were submitted to the Egyptian authorities in 1997 but these proposals were not implemented. The lack of a market for live cattle exports to Egypt has been, however, more than offset by the volume of trade in beef exports to that country in recent years. The Egyptian market for beef has been reopened to Ireland following intensive efforts throughout last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1732">The level of cattle prices is determined by the availability of outlets for both live cattle and beef. In this regard the continuing live trade to the Lebanon has been a contributing factor to the level of cattle prices currently obtaining.</p>

          <p eId="para_1739">My Department operates a number of specific measures to encourage young people into farming, apart from tax incentives which are available for this purpose. The principal mechanism in place is the installation aid scheme, which was established pursuant to the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and the early retirement scheme. Under the installation scheme, a grant of €9,523 is available to young farmers under the age of 35, who have become established in farming for the first time on or after 1  January 2000. In addition, "top-up" grants are also available to young farmers under both the dairy hygiene scheme and the farm waste management scheme. Under the early retirement scheme, older farmers are encouraged to retire early from farming in order to qualify for a pension which is jointly funded by the EU and by the Exchequer, thereby encouraging their replacement by younger farmers able to improve, where necessary, the economic viability of agricultural holdings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1740">In the case of young producers in the dairy sector, since the introduction of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 2000, the milk quota restructuring schemes have become the principal means by which producers can increase their milk quotas. Accordingly, I have been able to prioritise the distribution of available quota and young producers, especially those with small quotas, have been a high priority. These schemes include a number of special concessions to the younger farmer. The first is the priority allocation to new entrants of a minimum allocation of 50,000 litres. The second is the continuing priority of "recent entrants" up to the age of 35 to acquire quota up to the limit of the first category (180,000 litres). Priority to purchase available quota has also been afforded to successors of producers, who had to sell their quotas in recent years into restructuring schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1741">To give further assistance to the younger producers in the milk quota restructuring scheme 2002, the share of the pool to be allocated to the new and recent entrants priority category was increased. It rose from 20% to 25% of the pool available after the allocation to the two highest priority groups (i.e. successors to producers who had to sell into restructuring in the past and those who lost quota due to changes in the milk quota regime).</p>
          <p eId="para_1742">In addition to the on going priority in the restructuring schemes, I also afforded particular importance to young producers in deciding on the allocation of the additional quota that I secured for Ireland as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement. During 2000 and 2001, I allocated 45 million litres of free quota, that is almost one third of the total additional quota available, to approximately 3,500 young trained dairy producers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1743">In March of this year, I introduced regulations allowing for the registration of milk production partnerships. Milk production partnerships will provide opportunities for improving the efficiency of dairy operations and allow for a better mix between work and family life, thereby increasing the attractiveness of dairying to younger farmers.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_74">I will shortly finalise details of a pilot scheme to allocate milk quotas to farm managers, the objective being to enhance the attractiveness of a career in farm management for those with appropriate skills and experience. Teagasc have recently announced that the number of students participating in third level vocational courses in  agricultural and horticultural colleges has increased by almost 10% this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">The upgrading of courses to third level status is clearly proving attractive to young people interested in careers in agriculture and horticulture. Also, the fact that participants can progress from these certificate and diploma courses right up to university degree level is a significant factor in the big increase in student numbers. I will continue to keep policy measures under review.</summary>

I have asked my officials to begin this census shortly.</p>

In August 2000 the Agri-Food 2010 report was published in the Agri-Food 2010 plan of action, which set out a range of activities designed to strengthen and improve the ability of the Irish agri-food sector so as to best meet all of these future challenges. The plan of action contained almost 200 specific action points and a commitment to ongoing monitoring which was  further enshrined in the Department's Statement of Strategy 2001-2004. I then published the Agri-Food 2010 implementation report in December 2001.

          <p eId="para_1755">The importation of animal food products into the State is governed by a framework of legislation devised at both national and EU level. Control measures set down by the European Commission are implemented in all member states; thus a uniform set of requirements must be met by all imports into the EU. All animal product imports must come from EU approved establishments and countries and bear an EU health mark except in certain instances when a product may be imported under licence. Inspections and reports carried out by the EU's Food and Veterinary Office are designed to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU will be approved. In cases where the Food and Veterinary Office is not satisfied that public health requirements are being met, countries and premises may be removed from the EU approved list by Commission decision.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_76">Furthermore, consignments coming from third countries must be imported through an approved border inspection post upon first entry into the EU. An official health certificate conforming to model certificates set down in EU legislation  must be presented. Goods failing to comply with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and if necessary they may be destroyed. Once these products have met all required conditions, they are released for free circulation within the European Community. In response to growing concern relating to food labelling, I have established a group to examine the current labelling framework in the context of consumers' expectations and, in particular, to identify whatever gaps there are either in existing legislation or the manner in which it is implemented.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1757">It is Government policy to ensure that Irish exporters have unrestricted access to markets worldwide and efforts at diplomatic, political and technical levels have been made and continue to be made by my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia to bring this about. Following the BSE crisis late in 2000, many third country markets imposed bans on imports of European beef. It has been my experience that where restrictions on Irish exports of beef exist because of concerns about BSE, the most effective way of addressing this has been to underpin political and diplomatic pressure by demonstrating in practice to the relevant experts from those countries the controls throughout the sector. This approach was adopted successfully in relation to Russia and Egypt and is being continued with regard to a number of other potentially significant markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1758">My Department, with the assistance of Bord Bia, recently hosted a conference in Dublin on food safety and consumer protection in the beef sector aimed specifically at important markets in the Gulf region. The conference, which was attended by veterinary and food safety experts from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, afforded the visiting experts from those Gulf states the opportunity to assess the level and effectiveness of Ireland's BSE controls and I am pleased to say that reaction to the conference has been very positive. We are also in ongoing contact with the South African, Philippines and Indonesian authorities at technical and diplomatic level with a view to having those markets reopened to Irish beef.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_77">The UK continues to be our most important market for beef, with some 150,000 tonnes of Irish beef exported there in the first nine months of this year, and it is estimated that this  figure will rise close to 250,000 tonnes for the full year 2002. This compares very favourably with exports to the UK in 2001, which totalled some 210,000 tonnes. The corresponding figures for 2000 and 1999 are 110,000 tonnes and 95,000 tonnes. The main contributor to the dramatic increase in exports to the UK over the past two years has been the reduced domestic supplies of UK beef due to the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1760">Bord Bia, which has responsibility for the promotion and marketing of lamb, continues to help the industry to seek new markets and endeavours on an ongoing basis to maximise returns from existing markets. About two thirds of Irish lamb is exported, with a large proportion going to the French market. Spain, Italy and Portugal are the principal markets for light lamb from Ireland. Irish lamb is also exported to Germany, Belgium and the UK and small quantities go to the Scandinavian countries. The quantity of Irish lamb sold outside the EU is very small due to the fact that the EU is deficient in lamb and hence export refunds are not payable, which makes third country exports uneconomic under current market conditions. Bord Bia has been carrying out promotional campaigns in France this year, part of which entails identifying Irish lamb as such. These campaigns are targeted at regional level for maximum effect. In addition to these promotional activities, Bord Bia engages in trade liaison, trade marketing and in-store promotions with retailers of Irish lamb.</p>
          <p eId="para_1761">The market for light Irish lamb in the Mediterranean markets has been mixed in recent years. This is likely to continue, which means that the main focus of Bord Bia's activities will be to maintain existing markets and where possible to build new ones. The German market has remained consistent and the Belgian market is important for early lamb. Bord Bia will continue to support and assist in the development of these markets.</p>

To date, a quantity of approximately 6,000 tonnes of the total amount in store has been dispatched for incineration.

          <p eId="para_1766">I am satisfied that a comprehensive range of measures is in place for the control and eradication of BSE, including compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of herds, the tracing and slaughter of birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animal, a ban on the use of meat and bone meal for farmed animals and removal and destruction of specified risk materials from ruminant animals. It has been a characteristic of Ireland's approach to BSE that we have adopted measures which have been more rigorous and in many instances in place earlier than are required by EU legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_78">As part of the response to the increasing incidence of BSE across Europe in late 2000 and the resultant crisis in consumer confidence, the European Commission introduced legislation requiring member states to use newly validated "rapid" tests to conduct active surveillance for BSE. From 1 January 2001, member states were required to test all animals over 30 months of age intended for human consumption, all casualty animals over 24 months of age and a random sample of fallen animals over 24 months of age. From 1 June 2001, this requirement was expanded to cover all fallen animals over 24 months of age. In 2001, 674,633 rapid BSE tests were conducted in Ireland. As expected, this resulted in an increase in the number of BSE-positive animals, with 246 positives confirmed in 2001 compared with 149 in 2000. Of the 246 BSE cases in 2001, 119 were identified  through active surveillance and 81 of these were among the fallen animal cohort, which would never have been intended for the human food chain in any event. This rise in numbers has continued in 2002, with 284 cases identified to the week ended 31 October 2002. This includes two cases in animals from depopulated herds. Of the cases, 192 have been identified through active surveillance and 160 of these cases have been in fallen animals.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_79">In recent years there has been a shift in the age profile of BSE cases towards the older age categories, which indicates clearly the effectiveness of our controls. A total of 99% of cases diagnosed to date in 2002 were at least 6 years old at the time of diagnosis compared with 84% in 2001 and 60% in 2000. In terms of case numbers, 281 of the 284 cases diagnosed to date in 2002 were born in 1996 or earlier. No cases have been diagnosed in animals born in 1998, the year from which the scientific steering committee judged Ireland's control system to be optimally stable or capable of preventing the spread of disease. Ireland's measures to deal with BSE have been independently scrutinised by bodies such as the EU Food and Veterinary Office and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and have been found time and again to be comprehensive, rigorous and reliable.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1770">The fruit and vegetable industry has altered significantly in recent years. The role of the multiples has developed to the stage that they dominate the market in terms of sourcing the majority of product and setting the conditions for supply and distribution. Growers have had to respond to this change by investing in more efficient methods of production, quality control and storage. My Department has made a sizeable contribution to these investments by growers in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1771">Assistance for continued investments in the sector is being provided through schemes operated under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. These will provide substantial funding to aid growers in improving production methods and meeting the high quality standards which the market demands. A total of €24.6 million has been allocated over that period for schemes of investment aid in the commercial horticulture and the potato sectors. In addition a total of €25 million has been allocated over this period under a capital investment scheme for marketing and processing of agricultural products, which includes horticultural and potato products. Investments grant-aided under these schemes will ensure that Irish produce continues to be sourced by the multiples by enabling growers to grow, harvest, pack and store product in a manner which maintains their competitiveness. They will also help to overcome problems of seasonality by extending the availability of product.</p>
          <p eId="para_1772">A separate scheme which aids producer organisations under EU regulations is also in operation, under which my Department encourages horticultural producers to come together to form groups with the aim of improving quality, concentrating supply and reducing costs of products while respecting environmental conditions. At present there are 17 recognised groups representing growers, with an estimated output in 2001 valued at €127 million. This is an important scheme in terms of satisfying the requirements of the multiples and my Department will continue to encourage its development.</p>
        </speech>

These include the following: I obtained a derogation from the European Commission to allow set-aside land to be used for animal feed purposes on farms where 33% or more of the land has been flooded; I arranged for Teagasc to provide an intensive advisory service, both general and one to one; in co-operation with my col league Deputy Coughlan, Minister for Social and Family Affairs, I arranged that the farm assist scheme take account of the situation faced by farmers; I obtained European Commission approval to bring forward the payment of 50% of arable aid due to cereal farmers to 16 October; and I obtained an increase in the rate of advance payments made on cattle premiums from 60% to 80% with effect from 16 October. I have no plans to introduce any specific initiatives related to weather damage in the fruit and vegetable sector.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1774">When the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme commenced in 1955 the overall incidence of the disease was 17% and it was much higher in cows – 22% – than in other cattle – 8%. In 1960 almost 140,000 reactors were disclosed. When the level of disease had dropped to about 0.5% in 1965 the country was declared attested and the belief was that the remaining level of infection could be eliminated. In recent years 30,000 to 40,000 animals continue to be removed annually as reactors. This is despite a programme which has been operating to the limits of the available technology and the current knowledge of the dynamics of the disease. There is no doubt that the goal of eradication is a difficult one, but in continuing the present programme, which has been augmented by extra resources committed under the PPF and the use of technological enhancements, it is expected that the recent improvement will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1775">Research is under way in a number of areas to address the problems that have been experienced with Mycobacterium bovis infection. Significant improvement in the bovine TB problem should especially be seen after the development of an anti-TB vaccine for use in badgers, which, if successful, will reduce the development of the disease in this species and thus lower the risk of contact between an infectious badger and a susceptible bovine.</p>

          <p eId="para_1777">Significant progress has been made in recent years towards the eradication of brucellosis. For example, in the first nine months of this year the number of new restrictions was 351, compared to 749 for the same period in 1998.  Over the same period this year the number of reactors removed is 1,323 compared to 5,008 for the first nine months of 1998. The indications are that the reduction in the incidence of the disease will continue over the coming years, provided that the existing stringent control measures are maintained. However, as brucellosis is a highly contagious disease it is difficult to predict at this stage when the disease will be completely eradicated.</p>

          <p eId="para_1779">Agricultural product markets and prices are cyclical by nature. For this reason there are a range of direct payments and other market support measures which support farm incomes. In 2001, aggregate farm incomes rose by 4.2 percent to €2,614 million, of which direct payments accounted for 53% or €1,382 million. Direct payments are expected to increase again this year. I have considered the medium-term future of the agri-food sector. It was precisely for this reason that I established the Agri-Food 2010 committee. Its report was published in March 2000 and the Government's response the Agri-Food 2010 plan of action in August 2000.

          <p eId="para_1783">The position with regard to the 2003 National Reserve was that only some 1,500 suckler cow premium rights were available for distribution. Since demand for reserve quota exceeded that figure, there were not enough rights available to satisfy all applicants. Consequently, quota had to be distributed in accordance with the priorities laid down by the Quota Review Group and EU regulations as follows: 5% of the reserve had to be reserved for category B applicants, farmers with holdings on offshore islands; and 10% of the reserve had to be reserved for category C applicants, organic farmers. The remaining quota was distributed to qualifying applicants under category A – first-time applicants under 35 years of age – who, under EU rules, had to be given priority. As a result there was no quota left to allocate to any applicant under category D, i.e. farmers who required additional quota to ensure viability of their holding. Since the person named applied for an allocation of quota under category D, it was therefore not possible to allocate quota to him from the 2003 National Reserve.</p>

          <p eId="para_1785">Inspections in respect of the bovine livestock premium schemes are being conducted for 2002 on a producer rather than on a scheme basis. Instead of selecting a certain percentage of applications under each scheme for inspection as in previous years, my Department is now selecting a certain percentage of producers for inspection and is carrying out inspections on all applications for livestock premiums lodged by those producers at the date of inspection. Up to the beginning of 2002, EU regulations required that a minimum of 10% of all applications for the bovine premium schemes be checked on the spot but since then the requirement has been that a minimum of 5% of applications are subjected to on-the-spot checks. This change in the regulations will result in a decrease of more than 50% in the number of farms that are the subject of an on-the-spot check in a year. EU regulations also require that any cases that are selected for on-farm inspections are not paid either advances or full payments until the inspections are carried out and the applications have been found in order.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_81">At present about 1,500 cases are selected for on-farm check and awaiting inspection.

It is hoped this matter can be resolved at an early date and that all outstanding inspected cases can then be paid.</summary>

The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural land aged 55 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming. These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees. In this context, "qualifying lessee" specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives.

Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT. There are no provisions in the EU directive which would allow for any refund of VAT to exempt bodies. Even if VAT relief were possible, the cost to the Exchequer of a widespread VAT relief for charities and non-profit groups would be substantial, especially in the light of existing valuable tax concessions to charities, including the exemption from income tax and the availability of the uniform scheme of tax relief on donations which I included in the Finance Act, 2001.</p>

          <p eId="para_1807">In July 2002, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV-AIDS – UNAIDS – secretariat and the World Health Organisation reported that 40  million people were living with HIV or had developed full-blown AIDS. In 2001, over five million people were newly infected and over three million died of this disease. While the incidence of the disease is growing rapidly in the Caribbean, Asia and Eastern Europe, by far the worst affected region is the African continent. UNAIDS estimates that 25 million, or over 70% of the global total of people infected with HIV, are living in Africa. The percentage of the adult population living with HIV is estimated to be over 35% in Botswana and over 25% in Zimbabwe. In these situations, a child who is now 15 years old has a 50% risk of dying of AIDS in his or her lifetime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1808">HIV-AIDS is a major public health and development challenge in all the countries in Africa where Ireland Aid has development programmes, i.e. Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa and Nigeria. Ireland Aid's response to the epidemic is guided by the HIV-AIDS strategy for the Ireland Aid programme, published in 2000. In October 2002 the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, launched a new booklet entitled <i>Experiences and Lessons of Best Practice in Addressing HIV-AIDS</i> to ensure that the funds available to Ireland Aid are spent effectively in responding to the disease.</p>
          <p eId="para_1809">In June 2001, the Taoiseach headed Ireland's delegation to the UN General Assembly special session on HIV-AIDS. In his address to the General Assembly the Taoiseach announced that Ireland Aid would spend an additional $30 million on HIV-AIDS programmes in developing countries. Ireland Aid has, therefore, sharply increased its funding for HIV-AIDS programmes and will spend approximately €45 million in this area in 2002. These additional resources have enabled Ireland Aid to accelerate its response to this global threat to development. Over the past year Ireland Aid, using this additional funding, has increased its support to HIV-AIDS prevention and care programmes internationally, regionally and at country level.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_83">Ireland has contributed €10 million to the newly established Global Fund for Aids, TB and Malaria. We are financially supporting the development of both a vaccine against HIV and an effective microbicide. We have increased our contribution to UNAIDS and in 2003 will, for the first time, become a member of the programme co-ordinating board of UNAIDS, the body which oversees all UNAIDS activities. We have established a new HIV-AIDS fund within Ireland Aid, with a volume of €5 million, to assist the activities of Irish NGOs in fighting the epidemic. Additional resources have also been allocated within the Ireland Aid programme countries in support of HIV-AIDS-related activities. In September 2002 in Johannesburg the Taoiseach and  Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, launched a new Ireland Aid regional HIV-AIDS programme for eastern and southern Africa.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">The report of the Ireland Aid review committee recommended that support for HIV-AIDS should continue to be a major priority of the Ireland Aid programme. The Government has endorsed that recommendation. I affirm that in the coming years Ireland will further deepen its engagement in the international effort to halt and reverse the spread of the epidemic and to help care for the infected and the orphaned in the poorest countries.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1817">In July 1996, the Government approved in principle the recommendations in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector. The steering committee concluded that an upgrading and expansion of Waterford Regional College, now Waterford Institute of Technology, represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the south-east region. The committee's report also recommended an increase in student places, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title. It was recommended that the major focus of expansion be at degree level. It stated that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation in degree programmes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_85">The Government accepted these recommendations. The provision of both the total number of places and the number of degree level courses in Waterford Institute of Technology has been expanded annually and incrementally in line with available resources. In this regard, figures supplied to my Department by Waterford Institute of Technology indicate that in the region of 40% of students enrolled on full-time certificate, diploma, degree and postgraduate courses are enrolled on courses at degree and postgraduate levels. These measures, combined with the change of title of the college provide the necessary status and capacity for the institute to meet the identified higher education needs of the region over the coming years. Consistent with this approach, Waterford is among the first Institutes of Technology to be given the authority to make  its own educational awards under the terms of the Qualification (Education and Training) Act, 1999.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_86">My Department continues to work with Waterford Institute of Technology in developing and upgrading. Earlier this year approval was given to the institute to commence delivery of three new courses at primary degree level and one new course at Masters level in the current academic year. My Department is also working in consultation with the institute on the implementation of the approved campus development plan. An information technology building is currently under construction. A hotel and catering facility and the expansion of canteen facilities are in the final stages of architectural planning.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1823">I assume the Deputy is referring to fish caught in excess of quota allocations, which under current EU legislation can not be retained on board a fishing vessel or landed. The specific condition relating to control of fishing activities in member states, including the conditions relating to catches in excess of quota allocations, are agreed at community level and are set down in EU Regulation 2847/93, establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy. This was amended by EU Regulation 2846/98. The regulation prohibits the retention on board, trans-shipment and landing of fish taken once a quota for that species has been exhausted by the member state concerned. The regulation does not allow for the use of fish in UN aid programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1824">In response to concerns expressed by member states and industry representatives, including Ireland, about the discarding of fish, the Commission is bringing forward a communication to consider measures that could reduce substantially discards of fish. The communication is expected shortly and I will ensure that the contents are fully examined. I am committed to working with industry, the Commission and other member states to find solutions that will ensure that, as far as possible, fish are not discarded. In this regard, it is essential to ensure that any measures introduced do not facilitate or encourage the landing and sale of undersized fish, fishing when quota allocations are exhausted or any other form of illegal fishing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1826">The Government is committed to a viable and competitive rural post office network. There are no proposals to downgrade or close rural sub-post offices. However, vacancies within the network do arise as a result of illness, death or retirement. In such cases, An Post advertises the post at least twice and actively canvasses for suitable persons to fill the vacant positions. It is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found or where there are no applicants that a post office is closed. Such closures are regarded as temporary pending an application from a suitable person.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_87">The Government, An Post and the unions recognise that the network must adapt to cus tomer needs and the financial viability of the service must be secured if the network is to survive and develop. In order to meet these objectives, the Government has increased the share capital of An Post by €12.7 million to facilitate the implementation of reforms. An Post is also actively pursuing additional business for the network and has recently been successful in winning a number of contracts, including bill-paying facilities for the ESB, mobile phone top-ups through their post-point service and a contract with the AIB under which the banks' customers can access their accounts through the network. Parallel with these developments, under an existing agreement between the Irish Postmasters' Union and An Post, the conversion of sub-post offices from a fixed contract to an agency basis, whereby payments are linked to transactions, is being implemented on a voluntary basis.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1832">The Commission has brought forward proposals for the review of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, including in relation to fleet policy. These involve imposing restrictions on the days vessels will be allowed to fish. This is a move away from the current approach which relies heavily on setting limits on the volume of fish that can be caught – total allowable catches and quotas. This would have extremely serious implications for the Irish fleet, as the total amount of fishing effort – days at sea – the fleet would be allocated would be significantly less than the total that would allow the present fleet to operate on an economic basis. The Commission estimate in their proposals that over 400 Irish vessels would be scrapped, some 40% of the whitefish fleet. In addition, the proposals involve ceasing the grant-aiding of fleet renewal and modernisation.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_90">While I am committed to the introduction of changes to the CFP that achieve balance between the fishing resources available and the community's fishing fleet, the Commission's proposals are disproportionate and are not the best method for achieving the necessary balance. Ireland's existing system of fisheries management is restrictive, as it allocates fishing opportunities between vessels over the season to ensure a reasonable return for all the vessels. This approach maximises the socio-economic impact  for coastal communities and respects quota allocations. The Irish fleet is small and would be very seriously affected by the proposals. I am also seeking to continue to aid fleet renewal and modernisation in order to promote a safe and modern working environment for fishermen.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_91">The Commission's proposals were discussed at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in September and October. I outlined my opposition to these elements of the Commission's proposals on the basis that they formed a technocratic approach to fisheries management and would not ensure the sustainability of fish stocks, which is the primary aim. I explained that Ireland could not support these measures, which would force many family fishing enterprises in peripheral areas out of business. My position was supported by a number of other member states with whom I have been working, and will continue to work, to achieve agreement on a way forward.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_92">I am engaged in a series of bilateral meetings with member states to ensure that Ireland's concerns and its alternative approach to reform are understood. In addition, I am meeting Commissioner Fischler next Monday, 11 November to discuss the reform process and I have also arranged for Ireland's CFP strategy group to meet him to ensure that the Commissioner hears at first hand the concerns and priorities of Ireland's fishing industry in the review process. I can assure the Deputy that I will work intensively in the coming weeks to bring about changes to the CFP review package that deliver a more balanced approach to fleet policy, ensuring a sustainable industry and thus protecting the livelihoods of coastal communities dependent on fishing.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_1836">The Deputy will appreciate that a number of Departments have responsibilities in regard to genetically modified organisms. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has responsibility for developments in the biotechnology industry. The Department of Agriculture and Food has responsibility for proposed EU legislation on genetically modified animal feed and legislation on seed varieties which are in the process of being amended to take account of developments in gene technology. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is responsible for environmental issues in relation to GMOs. With regard to issues which fall within the remit of my Department, I should point out that policy in respect of genetically modified food is developed on an EU-wide basis. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of EU legislation regarding the genetic modification of foodstuffs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1837">Four European regulations are currently in force. Regulation (EC) 258/97 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients was steered through EU discussion by the Department of Agriculture and Food. This regulation provides for the mandatory labelling of foods and food ingredients which contain or consist of a GMO, without prejudice to the other labelling requirements of community law. The current GM labelling system as set out in this regulation is based on the detectability of genetically modified DNA or protein of GM origin in the final food product. In practice, this means that highly processed foodstuffs produced from GM material, such as highly refined oils from soya or maize, do not currently need to be labelled as long as GM DNA or protein are not detectable. The current labelling requirements for foods derived from a GMO but no longer containing the GMO are based on the concept of substantial equivalence. The labelling and other provisions of Regulation 258/97 as outlined above do not apply to foods or food ingredients which were used for human consumption to a significant degree within the Community before the entry into force of the regulation on 15 May 1997 and are not therefore considered to be novel.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_93">Regulation (EC) 1139/98 concerns the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms and is to ensure that the labelling provisions of Regulation 258/97 apply to foods and food ingredients consisting of or derived from GMOs which were placed on the market before the entry  into force of Regulation 258/97, i.e. certain varieties of GM maize and GM soya. It is intended that the labelling provisions of this regulation will serve as a model to provide the rules applicable to the labelling of all foods and all food ingredients derived from GMOs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_94">Regulation (EC) 49/2000 of 10 January 2000, amending Council Regulation (EC) 1139/98, addresses the problem of adventitious contamination of GM material in conventional food. The adventitious or unintended presence of GMOs in products placed on the market in the European Union is largely unavoidable and can occur during cultivation, handling, storage and transport. This regulation introduced a 1% de minimis threshold for DNA or protein resulting from genetic modification, below which labelling is not required, provided operators can demonstrate that they have taken appropriate steps to avoid the presence of GM material. Regulation (EC) 50/2000, which was adopted in January 2000, ensures that additives and flavourings have to be labelled if DNA or protein of GMO origin is present in the final product.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_95">On 25 July 2001, the European Commission adopted two legislative proposals on genetically modified organisms. The proposals establish a harmonised community system to trace GMOs, introduce the labelling of GM feed, reinforce the current labelling rules on GM food and establish a streamlined authorisation procedure for GMOs in food and feed and their deliberate release into the environment. The proposals aim to put into place a stringent regulatory framework and to close existing legal gaps. The proposals address the legitimate concerns of citizens, consumer organisations and economic operators. A strict safety assessment of GMOs will continue to ensure a high level of health and environmental protection. The labelling of all GM food and feed products will allow consumers and farmers to decide whether they want to buy food or feed produced from a GMO. I am advised that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is satisfied that based on current scientific opinion, GM ingredients authorised within the EU are safe for human consumption.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_1888">Guarana, a native South American plant, contains guaranine, a substance chemically similar to caffeine with comparable stimulant effects. Guarana, Paullinia cupana, is often added to stimulant drinks either in combination with caffeine or on its own. The stimulant effect of guarana is related to its caffeine content; one gram of guarana contains as much caffeine, 40 mg, as a medium strength cup of coffee. The precise source and nature of the stimulant activity of guarana is not well understood. However, it has been reported that guarana exerts a more prolonged effect than an equivalent amount of caffeine, even though the stimulant action has been attributed to the presence of caffeine. In determining the overall caffeine content of a beverage, the guarana content must be taken into account along with the caffeine content.</p>
          <p eId="para_1889">In May 2001 the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, in the USA informed manufacturers of foods and drinks containing guarana and other herbal substances including echinacea and ginseng that the use of these herbs in food products was no longer permitted, forcing the withdrawal of a number of stimulant drink products from the US market. The US withdrawal of these products is based on US legislation that requires the manufacturers to prove that all ingredients are safe for use in foods, even if they have received prior approval for medical use. The impetus is now on the manufacturers of these products to produce scientific evidence to the FDA that these ingredients are safe. The Food Standards Agency in the UK has asked the European Commission to investigate the use of guarana and other herbs as stimulants and flavourings in stimulant drinks.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_99">To date there have been no reported adverse health effects of guarana at the concentrations used in stimulant drinks. However, there is concern regarding the high levels of caffeine present in these drinks. Safefood, the food safety pro motion board, has recently published its findings following a review of the health effects of stimulant drinks. The main recommendations of the report are: drink products with caffeine contents greater than 150 mg per litre to be labelled "high caffeine" content and the amount of caffeine present be given; products containing guarana to be labelled likewise; stimulant drinks to be labelled with an indication that they are unsuitable for children under 16 years of age, pregnant women and individuals sensitive to caffeine; and stimulant drinks not to be consumed in association with sport and exercise as a thirst quencher, and products to carry a clear statement on the label that they are unsuitable rehydration agents for use in sport and during exercise.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_100">The Safefood report draws attention to the fact that the majority of the public probably do not realise that guarana-containing products are in fact high in caffeine. This is of concern particularly to those individuals who may be caffeine-sensitive and adequate labelling of guarana containing products is, therefore, essential. Since the release and uptake of caffeine from guarana is the same as for preparations containing free caffeine, it is clear that the guarana content of drinks must be taken into account when estimating total caffeine.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_101">The EU standing committee on foodstuffs has considered an amendment to the labelling directive 2000/13/EC. Member states, including Ireland, agreed in February 2002 to an amendment requiring specific labelling indicating the presence of caffeine and quinine in foods when used as a flavouring or ingredient. Products that contain levels of more than 150 mg per kg or mg per litre of caffeine will in the future be labelled "high caffeine content" and the exact amount present must be indicated on the label. These new rules must come into effect by July 2004. Against this background, there are no plans at present to prohibit the use of guarana. The matter will be kept under review.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1894">The development of policy on waste management, including the use of incineration for refuse disposal, is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency. In general, waste management objectives are designed to minimise waste production, encourage recycling and energy recovery while ensuring safe and nuisance free management and disposal so as to protect public health and safeguard the environment. Emissions from waste incineration can contain dioxins which are persistent organic pollutants. In 2001, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a study into the health impact of landfill sites and incinerators. I am advised that this research is ongoing.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_102">Dioxins can enter the food chainvia grazing animals. An EPA study published in 2001 confirmed the uniformly low levels of dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls in the environment. The EPA report “Dioxin Levels in the Irish Environment” is an assessment of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in cows milk and is a follow-up to a similar EPA survey undertaken in 1995. All levels recorded were considerably below those taken from a random selection of studies in other EU countries. The results also indicate a reduction in the levels recorded when compared to the 1995 survey. In response to European Union developments, Council Regulation 2375/2001, which came into force on 1 July 2002, sets legal maximum limits for dioxins – polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans – in certain foodstuffs, including meat, fish, milk, eggs, oils and fats and products derived from these foodstuffs. These measures are a key element of the European Union's strategy to protect human health by improving the safety of food. Member states, including Ireland, are expected to carry out random monitoring of foodstuffs for the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs which have similar properties to dioxins. I am advised by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland that the information available to date indicates that dioxin levels in Irish produced food are generally lower than those found in many other EU countries. My Department is in the final stages of preparing a national environmental health action plan. This plan will set out appropriate actions for dealing with a wide range of environmental health haz ards including dioxins. The plan will also address issues concerning children's health and the environment.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1919">The delivery of orthodontic services is a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards in the first instance. My Department is committed to supporting the development of the public orthodontic services and in this regard a range of measures have been taken to improve service provision on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service and ultimately will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1920">This year, my Department expects to fund 11 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 11 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. The training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods and are made possible by co-operation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_103">These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment. In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current  pressures on the system. Additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. Last June, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_104">The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the June 2002 quarter, there were 19,055 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 1,760 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">In its report on the orthodontic service, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children quite rightly drew attention to the fact that the co-operation of all regional consultants is required for an efficient service to be delivered in all health boards. I strongly agree with the committee's view that the interests of children are paramount and must take precedence over all other interests. My Department stands ready to support increased co-operation among the relevant stakeholders. I strongly urge those involved to strive for that increased fuller co-operation.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1929">The drug payment scheme replaced the drug cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes, and provided that families only have to meet the first €53.33 a month of spending on approved prescribed medicines. The DCSS threshold was €40.63 a month per individual, and for the DRS it was €114.28 a quarter for each eligible person and dependants. Under the DRS, the person paid for medicines at the pharmacy and claimed a refund from the health board at the end of each quarter. The aggregate financial benefits for patients under the DPS are clearly significantly greater than the old schemes. The total patient benefit under the DRS and the DCSS in 1998 was €95 million, the last full year of operation. In contrast, the DPS subvention to patients was €140 million in 2000, the first full year of operation, and rose to €178 million in 2001, an increase of 87% in three years.</p>

Regulations fixing the threshold for the new  scheme at €53.33 per month could have been made in July 1999 under section 59 of the Health Act, 1970 but as Government approval had been obtained to amend that section it was decided to defer making the regulations until the Act was actually amended. At the time it was envisaged that the amending provision would be enacted very quickly. Subsequently, however, difficulties and delays arose in securing drafting time and parliamentary time for the new legislation. Following further consideration and legal advice obtained from the Attorney General's Office in October 2000, regulations to fix the threshold at €53.33 per month were put in place under the existing section 59 of the 1970 Act in February 2001, with the required consent of the Minister for Finance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">As claimants derived greater overall benefits, reflected in the significant increase in spending, the issue of possible refunds was not addressed at that time. My Department has reviewed the position in relation to this question in the meantime, including consideration of legal advice received from the Attorney General's Office. Total estimated refunds are €17.3 million for a potential 175,000 claimants, with a total cost, including administration, of just under €20 million. The value of individual refunds would be between €1 and €250, with most refunds at the lower end of the range. Many claimants would have also received tax relief on these expenses.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_108">On the basis of the legal advice, the fact that overall the new scheme has delivered a considerable aggregate improvement in supporting individuals and families with drug costs, and the administrative complexity and costs that would arise, my Department does not propose taking any further action on this matter. Therefore, the GMS payments board's database will not be used for the request made by the Deputy.</summary>

On the current status of the project, the Railway Procurement Agency RPA has been advised by the main contractor that the timetable is under pressure and delays of the order of three to four months may arise. I understand the board will consider the matter shortly and I await to hear the board's assessment of the situation. The RPA is also considering the extension of the light rail network, as proposed by the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO and I await proposals in that regard. The DTO strategy estimated the construction cost of the full metro system at €7.2 billion and of additional Luas lines at €1.4 billion, in 2001 prices.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_110">In January 2002, the Government approved the commencement of the procurement process for phase 1 of the Dublin metro involving a line from Dublin Airport and Blanchardstown through the city centre to Shanganagh. The metro is to be developed by the RPA, as a public private part nership. The RPA is now finalising the business case for phase 1 of the metro. The business case, which will include a cost benefit analysis, a financing model, system and route options, the associated potential time scales, and the estimated cost over the lifetime of the project, is to be presented to me in the coming weeks and I will then assess these proposals. I have already indicated that I wish to see a rail link to Dublin Airport constructed in the shortest possible time frame. The DTO considered that the metro represented the best option for serving Dublin Airport with a rail based public transport link and I have no proposal for a heavy rail link to Dublin Airport.

The exposure to retirements from the Garda Síochána will be increasing over the next few years and this reflects the expansion in the size of the force back in the 1970s. However, the rate of retirements from the Garda Síochána is around 3% of the force per annum and is not projected to reach 4% at any stage in the next 5 years.

          <p eId="para_1981">Where land is being acquired compulsorily for public purposes, compensation is determined statutorily on the basis of the market value of the land in question plus payment for any disturbance, severance or injurious affection. It is a matter for the land owner to determine whether to replace the land taken. I have no proposals to change the law to give the option of replacement land instead of monetary compensation. A voluntary agreement on the acquisition of certain lands for national roads was joined between the Irish Farmers Association, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which was then the appropriate central Government Department in relation to national roads, and the National Roads Authority on 10 December, 2001. The purpose of this agreement is to establish additional arrangements and procedures, supplementary to those provided in legislation, to enable the NRA and local authorities, efficiently and cost effectively to deliver the national roads development programme within the time scale of the national development plan (NDP) 2000-2006. Under the agreement the NRA and local authorities, in return for co-operation from the IFA in allowing early and speedier access to land, will, <i>inter alia</i>, pay a premium of €5,000 per acre in addition to assessed compensation and assess the market value of land by reference to the value of the actual land parcel on a stand alone basis rather than as part of the whole farm.</p>
          <p eId="para_1982">The agreement provides for an independent assessment mechanism where the land owner and the acquiring authority fail to agree on the compensation package to be paid. The agreement also provides for the establishment of a liaison group, including representatives from the NRA and IFA to facilitate its efficient and effective implementation. The agreement, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, is currently being implemented by the NRA and local authorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_1984">The Planning and Development Act, 2000, grants additional powers to planning authorities to preserve valuable landscapes through the development plan. Objectives to preserve the character of the landscape must be included in the development plan, where the planning authority believes that it is necessary for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area. The objectives in the development plan may also preserve views and prospects or the amenities of places or features of natural beauty. The 2000 Act also enables planning authorities to designate special landscapes as "landscape conservation areas."  Additional restrictions on types of development that are normally exempt will apply in these areas. My Department has also issued a draft of guidelines for planning authorities on landscape and landscape assessment for public consultation in June 2000. The responses received during this consultation process are being considered by my Department and it is intended that final guidelines will issue in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1985">Ireland signed and ratified the Council of Europe's European Landscape Convention on 22 March, 2002. The general purpose of the convention is to encourage public authorities to adopt policies and measures at local, regional, national and international level for protecting, managing and planning landscapes throughout Europe so as to maintain and improve landscape quality and bring the public, institutions and local and regional authorities to recognise the value and importance of landscape and to take part in related public decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_1987">The Planning and Development Regulations, 2001, set out detailed requirements on the information to be included in an environmental impact statement, EIS. These regulations are based on the requirement of EU Directive 85/337/EEC, as amended, that the developer should supply such information to the consent authority. The role of the planning authority is to carry out an assessment of the EIS as supplied in this way by the developer. The planning authority, whether at local authority level or on appeal to An Bord Pleanálá, is required to consider the adequacy of an EIS; and  where the authority decides that the EIS is inadequate to require the EIS to be supplemented by further information.</p>

          <p eId="para_1990">No funding for approved applicants for disabled persons grants is being withheld by my Department from Louth County Council. Local authorities receive a total combined annual capital allocation from my Department in respect of the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes and house purchase and improvement loans. The breakdown of the allocation between the different schemes is a matter for individual authorities in the light of local circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1991">Louth County Council received an allocation of €500,000 for these purposes in June 2002. Since then, in view of their level of expenditure and commitments entered into, this allocation has been increased to its current level of €1.554 million. Two thirds of grant expenditure is recouped to the local authority by my Department with the balance being funded from the local authorities own resources and within amounts provided for that purpose in the authorities' annual estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1992">I am aware that, following improvements introduced by my Department to the disabled persons grants scheme since 1998, the level of activity has increased significantly and the allocations of a number of other authorities have also been increased to meet this demand. While it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation, an increased capital allocation would not, of itself, allow increased expenditure without a corresponding upward revision of the authority's provision in its own estimates for the payment of disabled persons grants. The amount recouped to Louth County Council under the disabled persons grant scheme has also been increased substantially over recent years. Last year my Department recouped €443,507 to the council in respect of 61 disabled persons grants compared to €146,337 in respect of 50 grants in 1998. To date this year, over €473,000 has been recouped in respect of 55 grants.</p>

          <p eId="para_1998">The stone saw purchased for the Kilkenny depot represented the lowest cost tender received during the public procurement process. My Department's specification for the tendering process related to the capacity of the saw to handle a stated size of stone and to carry out automatically, through use of inbuilt computer aided design, the cuts that are needed in the depot; compliance with new health and safety guidelines, particularly in relation to noise levels, was also specified.</p>
          <p eId="para_1999">The selected saw machine has an additional feature, not required by my Department's tender specification, which would allow further stone cutting profiles to be customised through active deployment of computer aided design. This feature was not sought by my Department's specification and would be of limited use for the works currently being undertaken in the Department. Its deployment is not, therefore, a priority at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_2000">Training in the use of the new saw has been provided at installation stage and the machine has been in continuous use since. Overall, the acquisition of this particular saw represents a significant enhancement of the Kilkenny depot's ability to undertake specialist stone cutting, and is generating efficiencies, although these have not yet been precisely quantified.</p>

          <p eId="para_2031">The White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity introduced a number of measures with the objective of supporting and developing the sector. The funding schemes to support the role of federations and networks in the sector and to provide training and supports for the sector are administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The scheme to support the role of federations and networks attracted 152 applications and required detailed examination and assessment which was carried out with the assistance of the White Paper's implementation and advisory group. The group which consists of both statutory and voluntary representatives is tasked with advising on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the White Paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_2032">The assessment stage of the process is largely complete. However, a small number of administrative matters remain which must be addressed before my Department can bring the scheme to a conclusion. Every effort is being made to ensure that these matters will be finalised shortly. The scheme of training and supports for the voluntary and community sector attracted 540 applications and a detailed assessment of these applications is currently taking place in the Department. All applicants will be advised of the outcome in respect of their application at the earliest possible date.</p>

          <p eId="para_2034">The person's claim for disability allowance was refused by a deciding officer following an examination by a medical assessor of the Department who expressed the view that he was not medically qualified for this payment. The person has appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office and in the context of his appeal he will be examined by another medical assessor. The person will be notified of the date and venue for this examination when the arrangements have been made. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</p>

      if she will consider granting to farmers, who come off the Department of Agriculture and Food farm retirement scheme a full non-contributory old age pension and disregard the income from letting, in view of the dramatic income drop associated with the cessation of the retirement pension; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_2036">The farm retirement pension scheme is operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food. Under the scheme, a pension is payable, subject to conditions, to a qualifying farmer who transfers his or her land to a transferee. The transfer may be by way of gift, sale or lease. In the case of old age (non-contributory) pension and other social assistance schemes payable after the age of 66, no account is taken of income from the farm retirement pension in the assessment of means. As provided for in the EU Council regulation governing the farm retirement scheme, however, the farm retirement pension is reduced by the amount of any national retirement pension payable, such as old age contributory or non-contributory pension. When farm retirement pension ceases, old age pension continues in payment at the same rate as previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_2037">Where the recipient of the farm retirement pension has leased his or her land, the income from the leasing is assessed as cash income for all social assistance payments, including old age (non-contributory) pension. Any change in the current arrangements in relation to the assessment of income of a lessor of land who was a former recipient of farm retirement pension would have implications for other categories of pension recipients and could only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</p>

      if she will review the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny to determine the reason this person's appeal failed; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that her Department's doctor took approximately three minutes to examine the person and that the examination consisted of a number of questions but no in-depth medical examination; the qualifications of the person conducting the examination; if this type of complaint is the examiner's speciality; and if she will accept the professional opinion as expressed by this person's reports and grant proper benefit to this person.

          <p eId="para_2039">The regulations governing payment of disability benefit require my Department to apply adequate control measures for customers in receipt of benefit. The medical review process  assists my Department with regard to these control measures. Medical assessors of my Department provide a second opinion to that of the customer's own doctor for the guidance of the Department's deciding officers who ultimately determine entitlement to disability benefit and other illness related schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_2040">All of the Departments medical assessors are fully qualified and experienced medical practitioners who have full registration with the Medical Council. Many have postgraduate qualifications in occupational medicine, some to specialist level. All receive continuing medical education, by national and international experts, in disability evaluation medicine. Most are members of the Irish Society of Occupational Medicine.</p>
          <p eId="para_2041">When customers are called for medical examinations, my Department makes every effort to ensure that the customer's interests are fully safeguarded. Prior to the setting up of all medical examinations, my Department first requests an up-to-date medical report from the customer's own medical certifier which is taken into consideration before the customer is called for the medical examination. The medical assessor reviews the history of the case, considers the available medical evidence, carries out a medical examination having regard to the certified cause of incapacity and expresses an opinion based on the overall clinical assessment on the extent to which the incapacity affects the person's ability to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_2042">The person in question was examined on 21 August 2002 by a medical assessor who expressed the opinion that he did not satisfy the medical criteria for receipt of disability benefit. Following that examination a decision was made by a deciding officer to discontinue his disability benefit from 29 August 2002. The person appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office and in this context he was examined on 14 October 2002 by another medical assessor, who also expressed the opinion that he did not satisfy the medical criteria for receipt of disability benefit. A form has been sent to the person in question to enable him to set out the complete and up to date grounds of his appeal. When the customer returns the completed form, it will be passed to an appeals officer for consideration. The appeals officer may decide to have an oral hearing before deciding the appeal.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_115">The person concerned has applied for a means-tested old age non-contributory pension on a number of occasions in recent years. Based on the information available to the Department on his means from a land holding, he would qualify for old age pension at a lesser rate than his widower's  contributory pension. It is not possible to receive both pensions concurrently.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_116">To finalise his means assessment for old age pension purposes, the Department has sought confirmation from the person concerned of the transfer of his holding. As soon as the relevant documentation is made available, his entitlement to pension will be reviewed and he will be notified of the outcome.</summary>
