            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2">A review of tertiary paediatric services carried out by McKinsey &amp; Company on behalf of the Health Service Executive, HSE, recommended the establishment of a single tertiary paediatric hospital in Dublin, co-located with a leading adult academic hospital.  Subsequently, a joint HSE-Department of Health and Children task group was established to advise on the optimum location of the proposed new hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_3">Based on this assessment, the task group recommended that the new national tertiary paediatric hospital should be built on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.  The task group's report and its recommendations were endorsed by the board of the HSE and by the Government, which mandated the HSE to move forward with the development of the new hospital and its associated urgent care centres and to explore any philanthropic proposition in respect of its development.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">I am fully satisfied that the task group undertook a rigorous and robust examination of the key issues in making its recommendation.  The task group conducted a thorough assessment and consideration of criteria such as the breadth and depth of tertiary services necessary to complement the paediatric hospital, ease of access, governance and site suitability.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">A joint HSE-Department of Health and Children transition group has since been established to advance the development of the new hospital.  Among the key items to be addressed by the transition group are the definition of a high-level framework brief for the new hospital and the determination of the range of services and location of the associated urgent care centres required to support the new hospital.  The group will consult with relevant stakeholders in the course of its work.</p>

          <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
            <p eId="para_6">This is an extremely important issue.  It is important that the selection process was transparent but the Minister's answer leaves me in some doubt as to whether it was rigorous and followed best international practice.  I do not wish to make the charge that political interference occurred but this charge arises because people are unsure as to how this decision was reached.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, indicated in the Seanad that three hospitals were more or less immediately knocked out of this process because of the breadth and scope of their tertiary services.  Given the Minister of State's assertion, the Minister should explain to the House the deficits in tertiary care that exist in St. Vincent's Hospital and the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, which make them unsuitable sites for the new children's hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">If the Minister is insisting on closing down the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, where does this leave all the other paediatric units across the country which are much smaller than the paediatric unit in Tallaght?  Does the Minister also intend to rationalise the services in these units in the future when she examines the wider elements of paediatric care?  These are extremely important questions.  We need to find out how the Mater site was selected.  Fine Gael has no difficulty with whatever hospital receives the new children's hospital but it has a considerable problem with how it is selected.  The Minister has not made it sufficiently clear how the site was selected and her answers so far are not sufficiently transparent.  She should also address the other questions.  What is wrong with St. Vincent's Hospital and the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, to render them unsuitable for tertiary paediatric services?  What are the Minister's plans for paediatric units across the country which are smaller than the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_3" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_8">A total of six hospitals were considered as part of the process undergone by the group.  These hospitals included the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, St. James's Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown, Beaumont Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and the Mater Hospital.  The group felt that only three of these hospitals — Beaumont Hospital, St. James's Hospital and the Mater Hospital — had the breadth and depth of speciality needed to complement the paediatric hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">I am not a clinician and am, therefore, not in a position to say what the particular issues were, except to say there are not many tertiary facilities in the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght.  The vast majority of children from that hospital's catchment area who have tertiary-related issues are treated at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.  As Deputy Twomey is aware, very sick children, regardless of whether their conditions relate to cancer or cardiac matters, are treated in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, rather than the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">I understand the group narrowed it down to the Mater Hospital, St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.  As a result of a number of other factors, including speed of delivery, it was felt that the Mater Hospital was the most central site and could be developed more quickly than the other two facilities, Beaumont Hospital being located on the north side of the city.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">There will be urgent care centres.  For example, the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, has a bed occupancy rate of less than 40%.  Thankfully, the vast majority of children who attend hospital do so for relatively minor events, day surgery or ambulatory reasons and do not require the kind of intensive care that will be available at this national tertiary hospital.  There will, of course, be children's hospital facilities around the country.  The new hospital will be a national hospital for those children who require very specialised treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">The McKinsey &amp; Company report recommended co-location.  In particular, there are considerable benefits when many hospital facilities are co-located.  We can see these benefits even in large countries like the US.  Given that Ireland has a population of only 4 million, the report argued very strongly that in certain specialties, it would be impossible to produce sufficient numbers of people to solely carry out paediatric work because the country simply does not contain enough children, given its small population base.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">I was in the Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago in the past two days.  It is located about three miles out of the city but will move to a downtown city site to co-locate with an adult teaching hospital and a maternity hospital for much the same reasons that we are seeking to do that here.  It has about 300 paediatrician consultants on its staff.  It is operating on a scale much greater than anything we could have, yet it considers enormous benefits can be gained from co-location.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
            <p eId="para_14">The question has not been answered.  Will the Minister release the information that resulted in these hospitals being discounted so quickly?  What is the breadth and depth of it?  I understand the Minister is not a clinician but many people would like to know why the Mater Hospital was picked as opposed to any of the other hospitals.  All they are looking for is the information on why the decision was reached.  Concerns exist that it may not have been as clear-cut as the Minister has implied.  The information should be released so that people know exactly why they were not selected.  It should be made crystal clear why the HSE considered St. Vincent's Hospital and Tallaght Hospital unsuitable for a tertiary children's hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">If the Minister is still intent on closing the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght she should be aware it will have a significant impact on the many other paediatric units across the country.  There are supposed to be joined-up policies in all aspects of the health service.  What is the thinking of the HSE in this regard, as it will have a profound impact on aspects of the health service around the country?  There is a need for the Minister to be honest with people about what she intends to do and why this decision was reached.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">The Minister stated that the reason she wants to close the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght and Crumlin Hospital and amalgamate them on to one site was that the outcomes for children's cancer are the only ones in keeping with the EU average.  That is an important fact.  The Minister only got McKinsey &amp; Company to look at paediatric services across the country.  No attempt was made to examine tertiary services for adults across the country.  Is there any request from McKinsey &amp; Company to do exactly the same for adult services because that would impact on the future delivery of services?  That is an aside and I do not wish to get into a discussion on the matter at present.  The HSE should make known how it reached its decision and what its plans are for the future, not just for Tallaght Hospital but for all paediatric units around the country.  The Minister should not hide behind the kind of answer we have been getting in recent months.</p>

            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_17">I am not hiding behind anything.  We proceeded on the basis that we would build a new hospital in Crumlin with 400 beds and a new hospital in Temple Street with in excess of 200 beds, in addition to the facility in Tallaght.  When the analysis was done the reason we came to this position in the first place was that many of the paediatricians in Dublin said to me that such an approach was crazy and that we should have brought services together years ago.  This was not something I had ever reflected upon.  That is how we came to the position of examining what we would do before it was too late and we had spent a great deal of money.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">The same applies to adults but, unfortunately, there are more sick adults than sick children.  Thankfully, there are relatively few sick children because children generally are healthy.  With a population just in excess of 4 million, we are not justified in having more than one tertiary facility.  In the case of adult treatments, we have to provide some tertiary facilities and they can only be provided on a single site basis.  What we want to do on the adult sites is to develop regional facilities where people can be treated based on quality assurance, safety protocols etc.  That is particularly important in the area of cancer care.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">In the end, the decision came down to either the Mater Hospital site or St. James's Hospital.  St. James's Hospital has the largest range of adult specialties.  The Mater Hospital's advantage was that many of the paediatricians in Temple Street Hospital are also on the staff of the Mater Hospital.  The site there could also be available more quickly because of the work that had been done on the redevelopment of both facilities.  We want also to make arrangements for a maternity hospital because many of the children who will be treated there are neonates.  It was for all those reasons that the decision was made.  I assure Deputy Twomey that there is no question of closing Tallaght Hospital.  The issue for that hospital is whether it will become an urgent care centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_20">I asked the group to examine as a matter of priority where urgent care centres in Dublin should be situated and what should be their scope.  Those matters must be agreed quickly.  Anaesthetists and others will be required to perform day procedures.  I cannot be certain, but, given the experience of the hospital in Tallaght, I would be surprised if the group did not designate it an urgent care centre.</p>

            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_22">My Department has been informed by the HSE about this matter and I have been advised that discussions are ongoing between the hospital, the parents' support group for children with diabetes and the network manager about the services provided for children with diabetes.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">A post of clinical nurse specialist filled on an acting basis has been advertised for permanent appointment.  A further clinical nurse specialist has also been appointed and will take up duty on 12 November.  This increase in support will improve response time to phone calls for advice and insulin dose changes, improve access to education sessions and provide greater continuity of service for children by avoiding long periods without cover.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">I am confident the HSE will continue to monitor the delivery of paediatric diabetes services at Cork University Hospital to ensure that the needs of service users are prioritised.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Ms Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_25">The Minister's answer epitomises what has happened on this issue since 2002.  In 2002, 120 children with type 1 diabetes were treated at Cork University Hospital.  This year, it is estimated that number will rise to between 207 and 215.  As the Minister correctly stated, discussions between the parents' support group and the HSE are ongoing and have been taking place for 18 months.  Local representatives are also involved in discussions.  We hear different versions of the answer given by the Minister every time we attend a meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">The Minister's answer in written form, which I assume is correct because she has responsibility for this matter, states two full-time permanent clinical nurses will be in place from 12 November.  Two weeks ago, the Deputies for the area were told two full-time nurses would be in place from 10 November but that one of them would be paid for by the private sector with a grant of €40,000 for one year and the other position would be filled by two part-time nurses.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">It is easy to understand how the parents involved have become frustrated.  No one knows what is the exact position or what it will be.  The HSE states progress is being made and it has an estimate in for what the parents seek, including a full-time consultant — who will now be shared with other paediatric services — and three full-time specialist diabetic paediatric nurses.  At present, 1.5 such nurses are in place, one of them for only one year.  The parents also need a space dedicated to their needs instead of sharing with everyone else as they do now.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">What the parents need to know is what the position will be.  The requests made by the HSE are for a full-time consultant, a full-time dietician with expertise in this area and three specialist paediatric nurses with clinical expertise.  I am sure the Minister has examined the Estimates for this year, particularly for this area.  Is the answer given by the Minister today the same as that which the parents will receive next week?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_29">I am informed a full-time clinical nurse specialist will start on 12 November.  At present, a clinical nurse specialist is acting on a temporary basis and that post has been advertised for permanent appointment.  That will mean a total of two nurse specialists.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">With my support, the HSE recently advertised for 100 new consultants to be appointed to hospitals during the coming months.  These appointments will be based on innovation.  When I refer to innovation, I mean the hospitals which are performing well will get more consultants because it is clear we will get more from consultants who are applied to an innovative environment than if we appoint them in a traditional way.  I do not know if Cork University Hospital will apply for consultants under that initiative but there is much interest from other hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">On a more general point, adult and child diabetes should be managed in the community and treatment should not be hospital based, which is not best practice in other parts of the world.  We are moving to ensure we manage illnesses such as diabetes on a community basis and the staff involved should work in a community setting.  One of the major discussions we are having in the context of renegotiating the contract of employment with general practitioners is how what are essentially nurse-led clinics will manage type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which have very serious consequences for patients and the health care system.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">Type 1 diabetes can take 20 years off one's life if it is not managed and type 2 diabetes can take ten years off one's life.  I met a lady at a recent event who has had her diabetes managed for 67 years.  She was perfectly healthy because it was well managed and she had not had many of the complications which, unfortunately, are suffered by other patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_33">Diabetes is a major priority and challenge for the health service.  I am conscious of the deficiencies that exist in Cork but I hope the appointment of the new nurse specialist will greatly alleviate some of the pressures parents are experiencing.  In particular I hope parents can have their child assessed on a frequent basis rather than as an emergency case, which is what happens when there is not an appropriate service.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Ms Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_34">We all agree diabetes should be community managed.  The difficulty in Cork is that diabetes is not managed at all, either in the community or the hospital.  If we were to apply best practice in this area, we would have three nurse specialists, a committed consultant, a specialist dietician and a special area to which patients could come to have prolonged consultation on a frequent basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">There were approximately 40 mothers with children from as young as 18 months up to 15 years of age outside Cork University Hospital this morning.  In ideal circumstances, these people would probably tut-tut at anyone making a protest.  However, the mothers have been driven to the point where they had to bring their children, who were being monitored, to the protest to highlight this issue.  This is despite the fact the issue had already been highlighted in 2002 in a report on diabetes nationally in which Cork was earmarked as a blackspot with regard to the provision of treatment for type 1 diabetes, which affects children.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">When a child is diagnosed in Cork, the parent is given a syringe and an orange and told to go home, to practise and that eventually they will get it right.  The issue is more serious when children are involved, as the Minister knows, and there it is necessary to ensure a regular and constant balance with regard to diet, insulin injections and the energy children expend.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">When things begin to go wrong for such children and their mothers telephone the nurse at Cork University Hospital, whether it is late in the evening or during the day, they will probably get an answering machine because the nurse works just two and a half days per week.  They are lucky to get a call back the following week.  There are parents in Cork who take their children out of the system there and bring them to Temple Street Hospital in Dublin, where there is a 24 hour call service and nurses bring their telephones with them to give the advice that is necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">Everyone agrees it should be a nurse-led service but hoping and wishing the system will be better is no longer good enough.  The Minister knows the position and what needs to be put in place.  The notion that she has instructed that 100 consultants be appointed is of no benefit to mothers in Cork given they are not certain one of the consultants will be available to deal with their children.  Wishing and hoping for it is not good enough.  What will the Minister do about it?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_10" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_39">While the Estimates have not yet been published, it is no secret that this year the HSE will get at least an extra €1 billion to provide services around the country on a priority basis over the next year.  We are fortunate that over the past nine or ten years we have been able to triple health funding because of the great success of the economy.  Health Ministers from Europe and elsewhere tell me their challenge is to maintain services with increases of 2% or 3%, which in some cases does not even meet inflation.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">As we increase funding, we must ensure we make appointments that make sense and on terms that make sense.  That is why the 100 consultants the HSE has identified to appoint this year are not by speciality but by priority areas, particularly in hospitals where innovation is being embraced.  I am not certain whether Cork University Hospital will qualify or has applied.  I hope it has done so.  Priority areas will receive consultant posts until we reach the stage where we can appoint the consultants we need for the health service over the next number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">I share Deputy Lynch's concern.  Diabetes, if not managed early, has catastrophic effects on patients, their families and the health system and budgets.  That is why this is a priority and I have had a number of meetings with HSE experts on how we can begin to have a community-wide initiative in 2007 to manage diabetes involving GPs and nurse-led clinics.  If we can move into that space, it will be successful.</p>

         the measures she is taking to ascertain the true extent of serious infections and fatalities from MRSA; the further measures she will take to tackle this crisis in hospitals here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_11" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_43">The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, collects data on MRSA as part of the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System, EARSS.  This system collects data on the first episode of bloodstream infection per patient per quarter.  The Irish data showed that there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 586 cases in 2005 and 285 reported cases in the first half of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">This year Ireland participated in the Hospital Infection Society's prevalence survey of health care associated infections, HCAIs, in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The survey provides accurate and comparable data on the prevalence of health care associated infections including MRSA in acute hospitals in Ireland and can also be compared to similar data being obtained in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Preliminary results of this study are now available.  The overall prevalence of health care associated infection in the UK and Ireland study, excluding Scotland, is 7.9%.  The individual figures are England, 8.2%; Wales, 6.3%; Northern Ireland, 5.5%; and the Republic of Ireland, 4.9%, the lowest.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">Active recruitment is ongoing within the HSE nationally to employ essential infection control staff, such as infection control nurses, hospital liaison pharmacists, surveillance scientists and clinical microbiologists.  The HSE will shortly publish a three-year action plan which will set targets in this important area.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">It is difficult to identify the number of fatalities attributable to MRSA as many people also have significant co-morbidity factors.  All medical practitioners have an ethical responsibility to complete death certificates as accurately as possible and this includes recording MRSA infection.  Discussions are ongoing between the HSE and the coroner's office as to how best to ensure the accuracy of death certification can be improved.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_12">
            <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_47">The organisation MRSA and Families continues its work of collating the incidence of MRSA arising from hospitalisations in this State and will hold its second annual conference this weekend in Waterford.  Is the Minister aware that the incidence of MRSA is increasing?  Is she aware of the recent shocking case of a woman who presented at one of our hospitals for the removal of a kidney stone?  She contracted MRSA through bed sores in her ankles and left hospital with both legs amputated.  That is an astonishing fact.  Does the Minister agree these are all preventable tragedies?  What we require is proper hygiene and supervision and the implementation of the guidelines laid down as far back as 1995.  Yet we see the alarming increase in infections and deaths being recorded.  The Minister made a point about the coroner's office.  Has she noted the requirement stipulated recently by the Dublin City Coroner for doctors to report to him all cases of death from MRSA prior to signing the death certificate?  Does she accept this demonstrates the need for proper recording of these deaths?  I believe this reflects the serious and growing concern among the public that the true extent of MRSA infection and its role as a primary or contributory secondary factor of deaths in our hospitals is not being recorded in all cases.  While the Minister may show comparisons with neighbouring countries, as she did in her initial response, the truth is, as indicated by the concerns raised by the Dublin City Coroner, that the problem is much worse than the statistics suggest.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">Will the Minister initiate action with her colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell to insist that all coroners emulate the action of their Dublin city colleague?  I am just looking at a number of particular points I believe are essential.  For instance, will the Minister establish a national directorate for the inspection, prevention and control of MRSA?  Will she expand the role of the Health Information and Quality Authority as regards MRSA?  Does the Minister agree that these are specific actions that could aid the objective of reducing the incidence of MRSA to the maximum possible extent?</p>
            <p eId="para_49">I accept the Minister is aware and appreciates the great frustration, hurt and pain of families who have lost loved ones to MRSA as well as those people who have had the harrowing experience of the loss of both legs as a result of being infected while in hospital merely for the removal of a kidney stone.  I know she must share the same feelings.  Will she now take on board the call of the MRSA and Families network for a public inquiry into the non-implementation of the 1995 guidelines?  We need to see the guidelines for the control of MRSA implemented.  Will she consider the example of a redress board, which the network has demanded, for the victims of MRSA in our hospitals?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_13" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_50">The Deputy has a number of questions.  The survey among different countries was a sample study of some 75,000 patients, 10% of whom were Irish.  It was significant that our rates were much lower.  I am not boasting about that, but simply pointing out that this is not often the message we hear.  The Deputy asked whether I agreed that these matters were preventable.  Unfortunately, they are not.  There is no such thing as an environment where people will not contract hospital-related infection.  The main reason we have higher figures for MRSA now is that there is more data available.  In the past this was not measured.  Nowadays there is much more measurement and that will reveal the type of data that was not available in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">The over-prescribing of antibiotics is a crucial factor worldwide, not just in Ireland.  At the last general election in Britain, Mr. Tony Blair set a target of reducing MRSA and other hospital-acquired infections by a third over an eight-year period.  Many would say that is a very low target, but it is nonetheless extremely difficult to achieve because of the difficulties involved in trying to eliminate hospital-acquired infection.  The most common infection acquired in hospital is a urinary tract infection.  That relates mainly to people who have a catheter-related infection, with the percentage being 56.2%.  A large proportion of patients with pneumonia, some 18.5%, get ventilatory-related infections and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_52">We must have a hospital and health care environment which operates to the highest possible standards of cleanliness.  The hygiene audit has proven successful.  Second, we should have people in every health care setting who have responsibility for infection control.  The hospitals that do best are those which have some senior person in charge of this.  That is why we gave the HSE additional resources this year to recruit specialist nurses and microbiologists in this area.  That is the only way of having the expert staff to ensure we have an appropriate environment within the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_53">We should have more single rooms.  On my two-day visit to the United States, the big issue there and in every other country is whether we should move entirely to single-bed rooms for infection control reasons.  With these, the capacity of patients to acquire an infection is minimised, particularly for very sick patients in an environment where there is much sickness and people are extremely vulnerable.</p>
            <p eId="para_54">We should not be complacent as we have much to do.  The HSE is having discussions with the coroner, and I will pursue the matter with my colleague, as the Deputy suggested.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_14">
            <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_55">I thank the Minister for her reply.  We all agree the kernel of the issue is hygiene and vigilance.  The absence of same is the real contributory factor to the problem.  Would the Minister not agree that hygiene issues arise for a number of reasons?  Part of it can also be attributable to overcrowding and understaffing in our hospitals.  Does the Minister believe there is a correlation and connection between both of these factors, which are very obvious and identifiable in many of our hospitals?  They must also be tackled if we are truly to grapple with the issue of MRSA.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">The Minister cited a number of countries for comparison.  Is she aware of other countries with better results?  I point her in the direction of the Netherlands as one example, as the Minister is probably aware of the success there.  We should be comparing with best practice, not the sadder reality under Prime Minister Blair's Administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">While accepting that the Minister has indicated she will look at the ideas mooted by the Dublin City Coroner, what we really need is accurate information, as well as real and concerted action.  We require accurate information to establish the true picture.  I am very much of the view that we are not seeing the full extent of either the primary or contributory factors of MRSA indepth in our hospital sites around this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">With regard to concerted action, I made some points to the Minister in my opening contribution, which I will reiterate as the Minister did not respond.  One was to establish a national directorate for the inspection, prevention and control of MRSA, and whether the Minister saw a role for the Hospital Information and Quality Authority in addressing MRSA.  There were also two points raised by the MRSA and Families network with regard to a public inquiry and the establishment of a redress board.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">The Minister has had to address such issues with other matters that have arisen with regard to hospital sites in this State.  We are both very much aware of those.  I do not believe for one moment that the issue of MRSA is going to quietly go away, or be suffered indefinitely by people without taking a serious stand.  That is already apparent.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">It is incumbent on the Minister, the Department and the Government to act now in a responsible fashion on this matter for all the right reasons, and not only because of the prospect of action by people who have suffered and lost loved ones from MRSA.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_15" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_61">Hygiene has a factor to play in all of this, but the biggest contribution is made by the over-prescription of antibiotics.  We must not forget that, as all the very strong evidence suggests, this is what has made our immune system so vulnerable to acquiring all kinds of infections, particularly in the developed world.  Hygiene is still a factor and hospitals should be run to the highest possible standards.  We have made major efforts over the past year with good and interesting results.  The newest hospitals or those with most resources did not necessarily do best.  In many cases old hospitals did well as a result of management.  One of the first tasks of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is to examine the matter of hospital acquired infection, particularly MRSA.  I agree with the Deputy that HIQA is the appropriate body to do this.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">The National Hospitals Office is headed by Mr. John O'Brien.  He has a number of staff and is considering the recruitment of additional personnel for infection control.  Staff are reporting to him on this matter and in time there may be a director at this level.  One must consider who should be responsible in each health care setting, which is more important in the first instance.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">It has not been possible to publish the Leas Cross report to date because of legal difficulties regarding its current format.  The Minister sought legal advice from the Attorney General and has requested the HSE, in accordance with that legal advice, to engage in a further process to overcome the legal obstacles that heretofore prevented the publication of the report.  The HSE has entered into such a process and has informed the Department that it hopes to publish the report on or about 10 November 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">It is vital that this report be published.  Does the Minister of State agree it was his policy to place elderly people in any nursing home with no regard to the consequences or the level of care on offer?  This is one of the core issues in the report.  Does the Minister of State agree he is damned in this report, along with the Government and senior members of the HSE?  His failure to publish this report gives the impression that it is a cover-up.  It is important it is published for the sake of Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">I have read the report and see no reason why it should not be published immediately.  What are the legal matters that prevent its publication?  There seems to be collusion between Ministers and senior members of the HSE to lie to the people.  It is unbelievable that the Minister of State has implemented none of the recommendations of the report and that he has not commented on them.  No legal matters prevent him from doing this.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">How much did the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, know about the situation in Leas Cross and other nursing homes over the past five years?  Where are the senior staff of the HSE and former staff of the health boards and what do they have to say about this?  They are not named in this report so no legal issues arise.  The Minister of State need only worry about his own incompetence, which is scattered throughout the report.  The report damns him for doing nothing over the past six years.  The report states that Ministers of State were aware of what was occurring as far back as 2000.  What briefing did the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, receive in May 2005 as referred to in the report?</p>
            <p eId="para_68">What was Mr. Aidan Browne, national director of primary, community and continuing care, referring to when he stated he received no complaints from the clinical staff of St. Ita's visiting Leas Cross?  It seems a huge amount of correspondence was sent between one of the doctors in St. Ita's and the HSE regarding the problems in Leas Cross.  Was this incompetence or a cover-up?  People deserve to know what Ministers and senior staff in the HSE knew.  Why are these people remaining so quiet?  There are no legal matters to be considered and if there are, they should be explained.  There is no reason why the recommendations of the report should not be published.  The Minister of State should answer rather than hiding behind lawyers and the Attorney General.</p>

            <p eId="para_71">The Deputy should allow me to answer because he has raised several questions.  No one on this side of the House ever attempted to try to cover up this report.  Following the television programme about Leas Cross the Health Service Executive asked Professor Desmond O'Neill to write a report on the deaths of residents in Leas Cross.  That has been completed but there are difficulties and the HSE was legally advised not to publish it in its present form.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">The Minister and former Tánaiste asked the HSE to work on the difficulties in the report to ensure that it would be published.  On or about 10 November, next week, the report will be published, yet the Deputy continues to talk about a cover-up.  We were always anxious that it would be published.  There is little point in my commenting on the details or contents of the report, or the difficulties therein until it is published.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">We were surprised at what we saw on the programme on Leas Cross.  The decision to go into a nursing home is a serious commitment for any family or individual to make.  It is important that we give the individual certain guarantees on the type of care he or she will receive while there.  The programme made it obvious that the system operating then was not appropriate to provide what is required and what older people deserve when they go into a nursing home.  We have worked on those areas and have promised legislation on that which will be published before the end of the year.  We have also drafted new standards.  We have made progress in ensuring that older people receive the care they deserve when they enter nursing homes.  We never intended to cover up what happened in Leas Cross.  We are happy to publish the report and learn lessons from the mistakes made in Leas Cross.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">Is the Minister of State saying that senior HSE staff did not pass on concerns raised with them regarding Leas Cross, or any similar institutions, in the past six years, to any Minister?  Were the Ministers blissfully unaware of what was happening in nursing homes around the country?  While that may not verge on negligence, it verges on incompetence.  It is almost criminal in regard to the senior HSE staff involved.  It will be important for the Minister of State, when publishing the report on 10 November, to make clear what everybody, particularly the political Executive, knew.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">Ever since the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, washed his hands of all responsibility for the health services, this hand-washing seems to be endemic in Ministers.  How can the Minister of State expect us to believe that he will look after elderly people when he has postponed all the relevant legislation until after the next general election?  The Minister of State should make clear when he publishes the report how much he and each of the Ministers in the Department knew because its comments on the senior HSE staff and the Ministers is damning.</p>

            <p eId="para_78">Following the programme on RTE about Leas Cross I immediately wrote to the Garda Commissioner asking him to examine it to see if there was a case to be answered.  The HSE asked Professor Des O'Neill to prepare a report, which has been done.  This report has been completed and will be published next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">Leas Cross nursing home is no longer in operation and has been closed down.  I do not want to frighten people into thinking that what happened in Leas Cross happens in every other nursing home.  From my experience, most nursing homes make an honest effort to provide a high standard of care to their patients.  It is important, however, that a proper scheme is put in place to ensure this happens in every nursing home and not just the majority.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">The HSE has adopted a policy of working with nursing homes.  Where there are difficulties, it encourages them to change their practices to achieve a high level of care.  It may not have worked in all nursing homes, but it has worked in many.  Through a process of communication and regular callbacks, high levels of care have been achieved as a result of the HSE's intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">The legislation covering this area will be published this year.  It is our intention, with the support of the Opposition parties, to pass it as quickly as possible.  It is not intended to put it back beyond the general election.  The Government has shown its commitment to older people and treated their issues as a priority through increases in the old age pension and the provision of an extra €150 million in the last budget.  That money was targeted in areas where it had real benefit to people through home care packages, meals on wheels and home helps, improving the quality of the lives of older people.</p>

           if her Department will provide adequate funding for the transport needs of older and ill people requiring essential hospital investigations and treatment; her views on whether the funding required by her Department to the Health Service Executive west needs to be increased in order that the old and the ill can get to hospital for appointments; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that lack of funding by her to the HSE west is putting the emergency ambulance service in jeopardy by underfunding as the money supplied to run the HSE west ambulance service has not kept pace with the increased transport demands of ill and older people; when adequate funding will be provided to supply ambulance transport to persons who need it; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_83">The role and purpose of the ambulance service is to provide a clinically appropriate and timely pre-hospital care and transportation service.  Pre-hospital emergency care and transportation services are provided as an integral part of the continuum of care for patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">The Department of Health and Children has been advised by the HSE that there was a significant growth in demand for patient transport services in the west between 2004 and 2005.  The ambulance service in that region has prioritised the provision of transport to oncology patients, dialysis patients, patients with acute lower limb injuries and transplant patients for one year after the operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">The HSE has advised my Department that it examines all requests for patient transport services on a case-by-case basis, taking account of individual needs.  The HSE's national ambulance office, in conjunction with the primary, community and continuing care directorate and the National Hospitals Office, is arranging for a comprehensive review to be undertaken of all non-emergency transport needs of patients.  It will include an examination of the service delivered nationally and make recommendations for its future development.  The group will also be tasked with developing proposals on how best to support patients who have to travel to access specialist services.  One of the key outcomes for the group is to complete a needs analysis and strategic plan for a national patient transport scheme, to be finalised by the end of 2006.  Subsequently, it will plan the migration to a separate role, which would be implemented on a phased basis from 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">I thank the Minister for Health and Children for her answer but the question I asked was would she provide enough money to the HSE west to bring ill people to hospital appointments.  Patients requiring leg treatment will not get transport unless their leg is falling off from trauma but not if it is falling off from gangrene.  I know of an elderly lady on a pension, whose family has a strong history of bowel cancer, who must have a check-up every year.  She is expected to get her own transport home after being administered an anaesthetic.  Does the Minister know that people on pensions must travel from Belmullet to Galway city, almost the same distance between Dublin and Galway?  Can she imagine a pensioner in Dublin having to go to Galway for a hospital appointment at his or her own expense?  Does this make sense?  It is a scandal and outrage.  How can the Minister stand over it?</p>
            <p eId="para_87">Will the Minister provide enough money to the HSE to provide essential transport for those older people who need it?  How can a pensioner pay €110 each way for a taxi to travel from Achill to Galway to have a pacemaker checked?  It is my job as a Deputy to raise this matter in the House.  I am outraged that the Minister has not responded to my specific question.  The Minister has given so little moneys to the HSE west that it is now facing a €3.9 million deficit which is threatening the provision of emergency services.  Does the Minister condone this situation?  Why will she not provide additional moneys?  What good is a review to a lady who must have her pacemaker checked but must borrow money to get a private taxi to do so?  She, along with many more, deserves more.  The categories of patients referred to by the Minister have been in place since March.  What about those with cardiac failure, liver failure and other diseases?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_27" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_88">Deputy Cowley is always outraged.  Every time I reply to his questions, I get the same response.  Last year, the HSE received an extra €1 billion, a 10% increase in resource allocation.  I do not divvy up these moneys as autonomy and authority for them are vested in the HSE as a result of an Act passed by the House.  It is the HSE's responsibility to use that money to provide for the transport needs of patients on a priority basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">I want the HSE to examine alternatives to the traditional ambulance transport to hospital facilities, particularly where long distances are involved.  We must be innovative in how we transport people to hospital.  On some occasions, it may be possible to transport the medics and the diagnostics away from Galway city and closer to where the patient lives.  If the case referred to by Deputy Cowley is common, it may be more cost-effective to bring the doctor and diagnostics closer to Belmullet.  I accept the considerably long distance between Belmullet and Galway.  The number of people receiving transportation in the west has gone up by 48% in two years and the cost by 51%.  An extra ten crew members have been added.  There has been an increase from three ambulances on a 24-hour basis to nine and 13 additional ambulances have been provided for the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">I accept challenges and deficiencies arise in how patients travel for treatment.  Earlier, in response to Deputy Lynch, I pointed out more must be done on a community level, particularly for patients with particular chronic illnesses.  They are all required to come to the regional hospital for treatment, a model not used in other countries.  It does not suit Ireland's circumstances.  It is neither cost-effective nor suitable for patients' convenience.  That is why one of the priorities this year will be to beef up community-based services that can provide greater supports to patients and minimise the need for them to enter the acute hospital system.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">It is not fair for the Minister to throw it back on the HSE.  She claims it is up to the HSE to prioritise resources.  On 1 July 2005, the assistant chief ambulance officer for the region, Paddy Duffy, informed me that "transport is provided on a discretionary basis on having resources to do so".</p>

            <p eId="para_92">That was July 2005.  It is now almost 2007.  Much more money since then has gone into the system.</p>

            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_93">More recently, the chief ambulance officer, Ray Bonor, informed me: "I would like to see all applications for transport for the elderly supported, but the financial resources to do so are not available."  The Minister should read my lips. "Demand always exceeds our ability to supply certain services; this is a common problem throughout the health service".  The HSE is willing and able to provide transport for these unfortunate pensioners if the Minister will only provide the funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_94">The Minister is failing in her responsibility by not meeting the needs of these older people who have done so much for the State.  In their autumn years, they simply require that they be able to visit the hospital to have their pacemakers checked.  It is disgraceful that the Minister refuses to provide the HSE with the resources to provide the necessary transport.  I would resign if I were in her shoes.  Those categories that are covered, including dialysis and oncology, are already oversubscribed.  As the population ages, there is an increased need for dialysis and a greater incidence of cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">The HSE is willing and able to provide transport for any impoverished elderly or ill person requiring hospital investigation or treatment.  It is scandalous, in one of the richest countries in the world, that it is not able to perform this essential service because of a lack of money.  The Minister should resign if she cannot even ensure patients can travel to their hospital appointments.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">Unlike Deputy Cowley, I am a full-time politician totally devoted to health reform.  In addition to his parliamentary role, the Deputy is a practising GP with a large practice in the west.  If he does not mind me saying so, he sometimes confuses those two roles.  I am sure what he is saying will sound great on local radio tomorrow but the reality is that this country's increase in expenditure on health care in the last ten years, including in the western region, has been greater than that of any country in the developed world.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">It is also the reality, however, that there are deficiencies and problems.  One of the tasks I have assigned to the HSE is to look at innovative solutions to these difficulties.  There may well be different ways of providing patients with their necessary treatments either closer to home, by means of doctors attending centres closer to where patients live on an outreach basis, or through the provision of modes of transport other than ambulances.  In most countries ambulances are used only where they are necessary and there may be other modes of transport more suitable in the situations to which the Deputy refers.  Other forms of transport are already in use in some areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">Our priority is to ensure services are available as closely as possible to patients' homes so long as this can be done without compromising the high quality of provision for patient safety.  If a person is obliged to make a round trip of 220 miles for a check-up, even on an annual basis, we should explore whether there is a better way of proceeding.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe are closely linked and many consultant appointments are shared between the two hospitals.  The HSE aims to maximise the range and volume of surgery and other services in each of the two hospitals by developing greater collaboration between them.  This is designed to increase access by patients in Roscommon and east Galway-west midlands to high quality services locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">The HSE has decided to create a joint department of surgery-anaesthetics between Portiuncula Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital, with shared consultant appointments.  There are no plans to discontinue any surgical services at either facility.  The HSE, in consultation with the staff in both hospitals is working out an implementation plan to give effect to this decision.  The objective is to provide an appropriate structure for a high quality, sustainable and, above all, safe service for the people of the area in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">I thank the Minister for her reply.  The initial announcement by the HSE indicated the transfer of inpatient surgical services from Roscommon County Hospital to the overcrowded Portiuncula Hospital, 40 minutes to an hour away, which is struggling to cope with the increased demand being placed on it from the west midlands, including Athlone.  This would mean that patients in west Roscommon, for example, would have to travel for up to one and a half hours to access acute emergency care.  Will the Minister clarify whether inpatient surgery will be retained at Roscommon County Hospital not only in the short term but in the medium term?</p>
            <p eId="para_105">Will she also clarify whether the two surgeons currently based in Roscommon will remain there rather than being transferred to Portiuncula Hospital?  A threat was made by the HSE to the effect that future developments at Roscommon County Hospital would not go ahead if it did not accept the original proposals.  Will the Minister clarify the position in this regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_106">Surgical activity was of a low volume at both these hospitals.  In the case of Roscommon County Hospital, I understand there were as few as two to four procedures per week.  The only way to ensure a safe environment for treatment is to maintain the skill base of surgeons through higher volume activity.  As has happened in County Louth, for example, Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital will become effectively a single surgery department operating on two sites.  Anybody who has concerns in this regard should go and see what is happening in Louth.  I have seen the remarkable developments for patients, doctors, nurses and other staff.</p>

            <p eId="para_112">No, my understanding is that one of the appointments was a co-appointment but the other was a full appointment to Roscommon County Hospital.  Will the Minister clarify whether the two surgeons will be based on the Roscommon campus?  Will inpatient surgery services there be retained in the medium to long term?</p>
            <p eId="para_113">I understand a consultant in emergency medicine, a third consultant physician and a consultant anaesthetist were to be appointed to Roscommon County Hospital.  In addition, a consultant surgeon was to be appointed to serve both Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals.  A threat was issued, however, that these appointments would not be ratified on a formal basis, especially the third consultant physician post, unless the original proposals were accepted.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">I said in my response that the new appointments would be to both hospitals.  In other words, they will share anaesthetic and surgical staff and there will effectively be a single department operating on two sites.  Subject to correction, I believe such posts were in the past appointed to both hospitals but it may not have operated in this way for training and other reasons.  The main issue of concern in Roscommon is whether activity will continue there.  I confirm that it will as long as it safe for it to do so.  If the team is appointed to both hospitals, that level of activity can continue on both sides.</p>

            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_116">We are seeking to organise hospital services based on the need for patient safety.  Procedures will continue to take place in a particular environment where it is safe for them to do so.  Where it is unsafe for them to continue, there must be change.  I have pointed on many occasions recently to the example of breast surgery.  In 2003, the last year for which we have figures, of the 1,800 breast surgeries that were carried out, 39 of the consultants involved performed fewer than five such surgeries per year.  We know from international evidence that this is a highly dangerous scenario in that outcome survival rates are poor when such a low volume of surgeries is carried out.  It is not a safe environment in which to operate. That happens in other surgical areas as well and not only in surgery.  We cannot allow that situation to continue.  I have said on many occasions that we cannot downgrade patient safety.  We must be able to give assurance to a woman in Donegal, as much as to one in Dublin, that she will have access to the same standard of care.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">In regard to the region about which the Deputy spoke, the idea is to ensure Mallow, Bantry, Cork and Tralee work closely together as a team providing an acute hospital service for the region, bearing in mind that we must also take on board patient convenience issues because of the long distances involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">I have a very high regard for Mallow hospital because it came number one in the first hygiene survey and number two in the second one.  It is a hospital I hope to visit shortly because what they do there is very impressive.  The Deputy need not worry about Mallow hospital.</p>

            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_120">The primary care strategy is the roadmap for the future development of primary care services in Ireland over a period of ten years, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people's health and social care needs and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals.  At the heart of the strategy is the aim of developing services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">I was encouraged to learn that in excess of 1,000 general practitioners replied to invitations from Health Service Executive local health managers for expressions of interest to become involved in the further development of primary care services and, in particular, in the formation of primary care teams either this year or in coming years.  The HSE has been working with stakeholders to finalise arrangements for the establishment of a significant number of primary care teams in development in 2006.  The HSE envisaged that between 75 and 100 would be established in 2006 and it has indicated that it expects this target to be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">As part of this development process, the HSE advertised in September for applications for up to 300 additional frontline health professionals from a range of disciplines and this recruitment process is approaching completion.  A considerable amount of work is being undertaken by the executive to realign HSE services to give best efficiencies for team-working and to determine ideal team compositions to meet the needs of identified areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">The HSE has informed me that work will also commence during 2006 with GPs who will help to form teams in 2007 and my Department will continue to work with the HSE to monitor progress in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">Is the Government still committed to the primary care strategy?  For instance, what has happened to the ten pilot projects established under that strategy?  What about the roll-out of the network of primary care centres that were to have been put in place?  What is the status of that proposition at this point?</p>
            <p eId="para_125">Will the Department carry out a comprehensive survey of GP cover area by area throughout the country?  Why has the Department not already done so, recognising that there are large swathes of this jurisdiction where GP cover is clearly inadequate and where locally-based GPs are making heroic efforts to provide cover to their dependent communities?  It is not only in rural areas in different parts of the State that there is inadequate GP cover but it is also a fact of life in many urban centres, including, in particular, the north inner city area of Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">On the need for additional trained medical cover, what is being done to increase the number of training places for medical students who intend to go and are committed to going into general practice?</p>

            <from>Ms Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_127">Taking the last question first, we have increased the number of training posts by, I believe, approximately 17 this year.  The college was not able to deal with anymore.  I hope we can increase that further next year and provision is being made to do so.  A number of general practitioners are prohibited under an industrial relations agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation to practice as general practitioners under the GMS scheme and that is a matter I am examining.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">The primary care strategy is being rolled out differently from the ten pilot projects because it would take an enormous amount of time and money to do so on that type of basis.  In regard to the manner in which it was rolled out last year, 1,000 GPs applied and 75 to 100 will be supported.  We hope to do the same next year and by 2008, we hope to have rolled it out to approximately 300 further GP practices.  It will be done on the basis of the initiative funded in 2006.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_131">Later today the House will debate Report Stage of the Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Bill 2006.  My colleague, Deputy Twomey, has consistently raised the concern about certain provisions in this Bill which will require the Health Service Executive to take into account 5% of the value of an applicant's house when he or she is applying for nursing home subvention.  I understand this rule is being put into primary legislation for the first time and it is the cause of considerable concern to a great number of elderly people, many of whom are frail and vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Yesterday I noted the comments of Age Action Ireland that the application of the rule would effectively force many elderly people to dispose of the family home.  The Taoiseach is only too well aware of the value of the family in our Constitution and the family home is part of that social bond.  In the past decade the country has seen dramatic increases in house prices.  For instance, the average price of a modest, average house in 2006 is approximately €300,000 compared to approximately €75,000 to €76,000 ten years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">The rule allows the HSE to calculate what it considers a notional income of 5% of the market value of the house.  That means someone looking for nursing home subvention and living in a modest, average house would have a notional income assessed at over €15,000.  The Taoiseach will be well aware that notional income, together with an old age pension, would see a person fail to qualify for subvention and, as a consequence, be forced to sell the home.  The trouble is that one cannot buy anything with a notional income.  One cannot buy groceries in Tesco, Dunnes Stores or elsewhere with a notional income, but the HSE can use it as a method to deprive a person of subvention for a nursing home.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">Given the concern and the fact that this is causing anxiety to a great number of elderly people, is the Taoiseach prepared to withhold the section of the Bill dealing with the 5% notional income assessment until its implications can be thoroughly reviewed?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_50">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_135">The subvention scheme is provided for under the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993, as amended.  When carrying out a financial assessment for the purpose of subvention, 5% of the imputed value of the person's principal private residence is taken into account.  There are exceptions, for example, where the house is occupied by a spouse, a child under the age of 21 or a person in receipt of certain social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">The Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Bill of 2006 is designed simply to put the current subvention scheme on a sound legal footing.  It proposes no changes to the financial assessment process that currently operates.  The position is that the HSE may make that assessment, which is the way it has been over the years.  The Bill provides that the HSE, with discretion, can refuse to pay a subvention if the value of the applicant's assets exceeds a certain threshold or if the value of his or her principal residence exceeds €500,000 in, or €300,000 outside, Dublin.  The limits were raised substantially, from €95,000 to €500,000, this year.  This does not represent any change from the current practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">The Government agreed on a number of principles contained in the report of the interdepartmental group on long-term care, which are reflected in the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  Advanced discussions are being held to draw up proposals for a new policy on long-term care.  I saw the newspaper article and the cases made, but this legislation aims to put on a sound legal footing what has been happening in practice for the past number of years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_51">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_138">I am sure the Taoiseach does not want a situation to arise where he and his Government are accused of forcing people to sell their family homes.  This was part of regulation.  Did I understand the Taoiseach correctly when he said that the HSE will still retain the right to exercise discretion towards a person in individual cases?  He said that the HSE would have the discretion to refuse a subvention.  Does that mean that the HSE will also have the discretion to approve a subvention, even in a case where the notional income is in excess of the 5% limit?</p>
          <p eId="para_139">In the case of a person in a Dublin suburb, with a very average house, with children living in Derry, Belfast or Cork, the tradition would have been that those visiting their mother or father at the weekend would stay in the family home.  However, the average assessment, notionally, of the value of a house in Dublin would now be well in excess of the limit for subvention.  Therefore, the use of the family home to provide an income stream to pay for care will deprive the family of the benefit of having the social bond of being able to return to the family home at weekends.  I ask the Taoiseach to clarify the situation in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">The Bill proposes that there will be an appeals mechanism set out.  We do not know what that mechanism is, although I see the Minister for Health and Children is telling the Taoiseach now.  We have not seen the details of that mechanism.  This is a matter of very serious concern to a great number of elderly people.  They do not want, under any circumstances, to be forced to sell the family home, if their families could find alternative means.  What is the situation in this regard?  There is no appeals mechanism obvious to us and the implications of this should be teased out more fully.  By enshrining the 5% in primary law, the Government is giving vent to a great deal of angst, frustration and genuine fear among a great number of people.  I ask the Taoiseach to clarify the situation, in light of enormous increases in house values in the recent years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_52">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_141">The value of the household under the regulations was €95,000 up to last December.  The limit has been increased from €95,000 to €300,000 outside, and €500,000 inside, Dublin, which is a substantial increase.  Deputy Kenny asked if the HSE has discretion in this area.  The answer is that the HSE may, in either case, use discretion.  If there is somebody living in the residence, for example, a spouse or child, the HSE has discretion.  The Deputy is correct in that I said the HSE has the discretion to refuse to pay a subvention, but it can work either way.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">The Bill is simply putting the current subvention scheme on a sound legal footing.  It proposes no changes to the financial assessment process currently in operation.  We had many discussions on this issue during the social partnership negotiations late last year and earlier this year.  Advanced discussions are being held to help draw up proposals for a new policy on long-term care, based on the principles endorsed by the Government and the social partners.  These include appropriate and equitable levels of co-payments by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  The aim is to achieve an equitable, balanced scheme, for residential and community care and for public and private provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">That ongoing work was commenced under social partnership talks and we must now take it forward.  We have been examining a number of models, suggestions and analyses of how this can best be done.  That work is not yet complete, but it is our intention to bring forward proposals for a new policy for long-term care.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_144">The Minister for Social and Family Affairs recently said he was alarmed to find that so many poor people are in the grip of money lenders.  He went on to say that the scale of the problem was alarming, given that the clients of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are in debt this year to the tune of €65 million.  The Minister said this was outrageous.  In case the Taoiseach missed the interview, here is what the Minister said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_145">I've just discovered that a whole range of these people who are in debt, it's a new kind of debt.  In the old days, it was money lenders, a back street kind of thing, but today these are official legal lenders and in one case they were charging 39% interest to people who were borrowing to pay for First Communion, bereavements, Christmas, family events or just to pay their rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">He also said: "At the start of the 21st century, we still have an underbelly of debt in this country and I have instructed my Department to prepare legislation on this."  The Minister went on to say that he was taking legal advice as to whether, in drawing up the new legislation, "outrageous and totally unacceptable rates of up to 39% can be curbed or even banned".  I ask the Taoiseach when this legislation will appear.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">I am delighted the Minister for Social and Family Affairs can be with us.  I met a woman in Cork last week who told me that every time the Minister, Deputy Brennan, gives a television interview, her dog licks the television set.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">This Bill was published in March 2002, re-entered on the current Government's schedule and has remained there for the past four years without ever having been brought before this House.  However, in his weekend round of interviews the Minister told Ursula Halligan that he has instructed his officials to the effect that poor people are in debt and that he would introduce new legislation to deal with it.  What order is this new law and when will Members see it?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_157">As for the two pieces of legislation, some time ago the Minister decided the legislation listed and the heads of that Bill were unsatisfactory.  He announced some time ago that he would introduce a different, more comprehensive Bill to deal with the issue of loans.  He was referring to legalised loans rather than to moneylenders, as many of the organisations in question are licensed.  He stated he believed there was a different way of dealing with the issue and sought legal advice to do so.  This is all that was engaged in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">The new legislation is listed to come before the Government shortly.  As we do this time every year, the Minister has been talking to all the relevant groups regarding their pre-budget submissions and hopes to bring forward the terms of his legislation to the Government shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">The point is that while Deputy Rabbitte raised a number of issues, poverty and social exclusion still has a significant impact on a certain group.  It has been highlighted for some years that it is not good enough for us to deal with such matters simply on an administrative basis and that legislation is required.  The question is whether it is possible to legislate for such issues and legal advice has been sought in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">To the best of my knowledge this was considered approximately 20 years ago.  At that time, the view was that one could not legislate for such issues, particularly as a number of the organisations in question are licensed.  They operate under Acts of this House and must be examined under consumer legislation.  I do not know the answer to the question as to whether one can act.  The Minister believes he can bring forward this legislation based on financial advice and is committed to introducing a new Bill.  He intends to bring its terms before the Government around the time of the introduction of this year's social welfare Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_63">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_161">I agree with the Taoiseach that a poverty problem exists and that some people are in the grip of moneylenders and pay high interest rates.  In a society based on credit, some people cannot get access to credit from conventional institutions and therefore resort to moneylenders, for which there is a premium to be paid.  I do not dispute any of that.  However, I asked the Taoiseach about the legislation promised by the Minister to ban or curb such exorbitant interest rates and he now tells me that no such legislation is contemplated.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">As for the refurbishment of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, it is odd that the Government published a Bill in this respect in March 2002 that has never been introduced to the House on Second Stage and that Members are now informed that the Minister finds it to be defective.  Although he did not do so in the past four and a half years, it is claimed he will bring in legislation in the four and a half months left to him.</p>

          <p eId="para_171">As Deputy Rabbitte is aware, there are, on the face of it, powers to deal with a number of these issues under several legislative measures.  However, they have not proven to be effective over a long time.  While the Deputy noted that the Bill is from 2002, the Bill that we had approved is from the late 1990s as the issue was discussed in the late 1990s and in 2000.  In the view of the Minister's officials, the Bill in question can be improved considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">As for the legislation regarding the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, while there are no rocket science issues involved, it is a question of being able to table a Bill with the legal powers to in some way curtail, prevent and control legally based organisations in such a way that they cannot levy punitive interest rates on those who are, as the Deputy correctly noted, marginalised, excluded or affected.  I refer to those who find themselves with no alternative except to borrow what are usually relatively small amounts of money, but who pay exorbitant rates.  It is a question of introducing legislation that can do something in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">The Minister has advised me that he awaits this legal advice.  However, the Deputy and I are aware that this has been attempted since the 1960s, back in the days when money launderers and moneylenders operated in this city and elsewhere.  To my knowledge, an effective way of dealing with them — when legalised — has not been found.  There is an effective way of dealing with illegal operators who operate outside the system.  It is a question of whether this can be done.  This is the point on which the Minister is waiting.  The difficulty or delay does not lie with the remainder of the proposals regarding the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, other initiatives and whether credit unions can help — credit unions are already very helpful in this regard.  It is a question of whether one can control or curtail such people.  When the Minister receives his advice in this regard, he will be able to proceed with the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_174">The Government claims the shared ownership scheme between first-time buyers and local authorities to be one of the successes of its so-called housing policy.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the price limit for a housing unit that may be purchased via this scheme in the four local authority areas covering this city and its environs is between €210,000 and €275,000?  Does the Taoiseach share with Members the despair of those first-time buyers, given the limitations that apply under this scheme?  The set figures deny people who aspire to shared ownership via this scheme and close it off for them entirely across the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Last week, Sinn Féin conducted a survey in the four Dublin local authority areas.  A total of 24 estate agents across Dublin were surveyed and we found only 12 properties across the four areas for sale within the limits of the shared ownership scheme as laid down in each of the authority areas.  A total of 11 of the properties were located within the Dublin City Council area.  No suitable accommodation was found in the Fingal or South Dublin County Council areas and only one was found in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Of the 11 properties found in the Dublin City Council area, three were so-called apartments.  They were little more than one room and one bedroom facilities.  Seven of them were one bedroom apartments, ranging in price from €195,000 to €260,000.  We only found a single two bedroom house, which was priced at €259,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">Does the Taoiseach accept that there are thousands of people on the social housing list in Dublin and hundreds of these have applied for the shared ownership scheme?  Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that applications from these people are, to all intents and purposes, a waste of time, given the restrictive ceiling figures that apply for this scheme in the respective four authority areas cited by me?  What will the Taoiseach do to tackle house prices and to tackle the need of the many thousands of families — over 44,000 identifiable household units — across this State, many of whom are in the city of Dublin?  Will he, for instance, reinstate Part V of the Planning and Development Act, that he diluted in 2002 at the behest of developers and speculators?  Will he also consider compulsory purchase orders in respect of land for the provision of much-needed housing, as is done for the provision of roads?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_75">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_178">In respect of shared ownership and other schemes, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with responsibility for housing examines the thresholds for these schemes on an annual basis and continually adjusts them based on what is happening in the market.  It is true that in the first half of this year, there was a very steep increase in prices in the third quarter, particularly in the second-hand market in Dublin.  This increase has stabilised to great extent.  The Minister of State will examine the figures, as he does every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Approximately 17,000 units will be delivered for various affordable housing schemes between 2007 and 2009.  That is in line with what has happened in the past few years across a range of schemes.  There are approximately six different national schemes administered by local authorities that assist people in that regard.  Last year, we established the affordable homes partnership to add impetus to the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area, where price pressures, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, are greatest.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">As well as producing some very good and easily understood information, particularly for young people and people on affordable housing, which sets out the various local authority papers and position in very clear language and has proven to be very helpful, the partnership group has advanced a number of projects.  It has exchanged sites like Broc House for affordable housing and has continued with other schemes.  It began with the Harcourt Street deal, invited proposals to bring forward additional land, mainly for affordable housing, provided high quality guidance on affordable housing schemes and produced a range of other initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Approximately 70 sites have been identified for State or local authority lands.  There is an output from Part V, which has the potential to deliver a target figure of approximately 10,000 units.  Members will have seen the information on Part V produced by the Department in the past few days which shows that far greater output is received from Part V as the old planning permissions have run through the system.  As the Deputy will recall, changes were made to Part V because it was stated in this House and elsewhere that because Part V was so restrictive, it would stagnate the market when we needed to create supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The nucleus of Part V is working.  The initiative has delivered and hopes to deliver several thousand units over the next few years.  It is estimated that approximately 2,250 units will be provided under the initiative this year and that over 3,000 units will be provided next year.  As Members can see from the information provided by the affordable homes partnership, the partnership has identified a large amount of housing, admittedly mainly apartments, that are within the range of affordable houses on the fringes of the greater Dublin area, which should certainly help the 44,000 household units referred to by Deputy Ó Caoláin.  In addition — the Deputy did not raise this matter — there is provision this year for approximately €2 billion to be spent by local authorities on social housing, which is more than double the expenditure of six years ago.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_183">One would have to point out to the Taoiseach that Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was brought in some years ago.  We are now heading into 2007.  The five-year position in respect of planning approvals kicking in would surely have shown before now.  Much of the response the Taoiseach has given this afternoon is clearly from a briefing note prepared last year, which did not kick in this year either and I fear will not do so in 2007.  It is stale and needs to be revisited.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">There are 44,000 identifiable household units across this State, including a great number of people in the city of Dublin, who are anxiously waiting for the provision of social or affordable housing.  Only 5% of the houses completed across this State in the first three months of this year were in the social or affordable housing category.  Does the Taoiseach agree that this is a very poor number, given that there is a real crisis, identified by a raft of organisations and commentators in this area?</p>

          <p eId="para_186">Does the Taoiseach not agree that we need to see the restoration of Part V of the Planning and Development Act, which was introduced by his Government and supported by me?  This measure was innovative and courageous, yet the Government buckled under the pressure in 2002 and amended it to suit the interests of a particular sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">In the course of his reply, the Taoiseach neglected to address the ceiling figures I identified as a result of the survey we have carried out that clearly shows that the shared ownership scheme is a non-runner.  It is a dead duck across the four local authority areas in the city of Dublin.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the threshold for qualification for the shared ownership scheme is increased adequately in line with the situation that is real outside this House for so many people in this city?</p>

          <p eId="para_188">I thought I had answered the Deputy's last point, but to clarify matters, the thresholds for people applying under the various schemes are examined on an annual basis and I understand they will be examined again this year.  They are based on what happened in the market during the previous year and are examined annually.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">Yes, I will raise that issue.  I do not wish to debate Part V, but when we introduced Part V of the Planning and Development Act, the cry from everywhere was that it was overly restrictive and unworkable and would not provide us with a supply so we made changes to it.  We were told at the time that there would be a run-through of approximately five years before those planning permissions were dealt with and that we would not get the benefit of this measure for a number of years.  We are now beginning to obtain the benefits, as I demonstrated with the figures I quoted earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The most up-to-date figures show that we are heading this year for approximately 90,000 completions.  In Towards 2016, we committed ourselves to producing 17,000 affordable houses over a three-year period.  The needs of approximately 60,000 households will be met through the various schemes.  These were the figures agreed under the social partnership process, towards which the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is working.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">We are examining issues surrounding developers who have land with planning permission but are not building on that land.  There is an argument about how extensive this problem is but we are examining the relevant legislation to try to find a legal method of forcing people who sit on planning permissions and watch prices escalate to build on those lands.  We are at an advanced stage in respect of legislation on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">As we head into November, the affordable housing schemes, the affordable housing partnership, the housing programme itself and social programmes are well on target in respect of the commitments in that regard at the beginning of the year.  Approximately 6,500 local authority houses will be acquired this year, including units provided under various regeneration schemes.  A total of 14,000 household units will be acquired from a range of social and affordable housing schemes, representing an additional investment for the period ahead.  There has been an acquisition of a further 4,000 housing units, bringing the total number for the latest period on which the Department worked up to 27,000.  That is quite an increase.  The Deputy stated there are 44,000 people on the housing list but that is almost a 10% decrease on the last housing statistics.  That is a considerable decrease.  The income threshold for eligibility under the grant schemes will be examined.  They are usually considered at the end of the year but I will raise the issue with the Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_203">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">The four principal legal functions carried out by the Office of the Attorney General are summarised in paragraph 2.3 of the Sullivan report as (i) the provision of legal advice — advisory counsel; (ii) legislative drafting — Parliamentary Counsel; (iii) the processing of litigation; and (iv) conveyancing and other transactional services, the Chief State's Solicitor's Office, CSSO.</p>
            <p eId="para_205">The report on the Sullivan review of the Office of the Attorney General, submitted in June 2006, contained 19 recommendations, the final one being that the director general should keep the implementation and operation of the new measures under review.  The report also provided that the first such review is to be completed within six months.  Substantial progress has been made already in implementing the recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_206">To assist the director general, the office put in place an action plan which is regularly monitored by a review working group comprising officials of the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  The three-person panel of external experts, appointed by the Attorney General to review risk management procedures within the office, has had two meetings with the Attorney General, the director general and the deputy director general.  The panel members have been supplied with relevant material to enable them to familiarise themselves with the internal procedures and protocols of the office together with relevant office publications, risk management policy and a risk register.  The panel has also met and plans to meet soon with the Chief State Solicitor and the office audit committee.  The panel members will also be reviewing the processes involved in dealing with files in the office.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">New enhanced procedures in regard to sensitive files were put in place at the end of July, placed on the office intranet and all advisory counsel notified.  These procedures will be reviewed in the light of experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_208">The office implemented a procedure to consult with and brief relevant Departments to ensure that they develop an appropriate containment strategy for each risk identified.  The office prepared and reviewed status reports as to all cases pointing where legislation is being constitutionally challenged.  The office's risk assessment policy and risk register were addressed in the office's statement of strategy 2006-08 which was published in July and the register is being reviewed in the context of new business plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">Protocols have been put in place to ensure the effective handover of responsibilities to new group co-ordinators within the advisory side of the office.  Five advisory counsel grade II have been designated to undertake specific responsibility for risk assessment as envisaged in the Sullivan report.</p>
            <p eId="para_210">Written reports are now submitted by each advisory counsel grade I to the weekly review meeting and a new legal management committee has been established.  The committee which includes the Attorney General, senior officials of the advisory and drafting sides of the Office of the Attorney General and senior officials of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor had its inaugural meeting on 11 October and will meet again in November and thereafter every two months.</p>
            <p eId="para_211">Considerable work has been undertaken in regard to development of IT systems to support the management of sensitive cases.  Existing systems have already been modified while the new systems being developed will have the necessary functionality.  Recommended changes to the office's intranet have also been implemented.  The Office has formulated and agreed procedures for mentoring for new advisory counsel, including a general checklist of milestones for litigation cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_212">Six advisory counsel grade III have been recruited by the office for training prior to secondment to Departments.  The first two secondments — to the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Education and Science — took place on 2 and 9 October, respectively.  Further secondments will follow in coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_213">Discussions have taken place between the office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions about the transfer of responsibility for fisheries prosecutions to that office.  Discussions have also taken place between the office and the Chief State Solicitor's office with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the transfer of the administration of the Attorney General's scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_214">Formal protocols to ensure that all pleadings and submissions in constitutional and sensitive cases are approved by the Attorney General and confirmed by the director general via the Chief State Solicitor, with notification to Departments and the Secretary General to the Government, were put in place in the measures introduced in August relating to sensitive cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_215">Two meetings have taken place between officials of the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to review and assess the effect, if any, on the general enforcement of the criminal law of any constitutional challenges.  The results of these meetings have been conveyed to the relevant line Departments and to the Secretary General to the Government.  A memorandum for the information of the Government will be submitted at regular intervals giving an update on important litigation being handled by the relevant offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">The action plan also includes monitoring of the new procedures proposed by the Attorney General which are appended to the Sullivan report.  The director general of the Office of the Attorney General hosted a conference on 6 October 2006, attended by representatives from the Attorney General's office, the Chief State Solicitor's office, CSSO, the Courts Service, the Director of Public Prosecutions' office, the Chief Prosecution Solicitor's office and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to discuss channels of communication between all stakeholders in serious litigation cases.  At the conference, certain action points were agreed as follows.  The office, in consultation with the CSSO, the Director of Public Prosecutions office, DPPO, and the Revenue Solicitor's Office, RSO, would draft and publish a practice note in the <i>Law Society Gazette</i> outlining service requirements for State offices and that counsel would also be made aware of the practice note; the office, the CSSO and the PPO will make contact with the president of the High Court on difficulties caused by the late filing of written submissions in serious litigation cases; and the participating offices will jointly develop a protocol to ensure prompt communication and co-operation between the offices.</p>

            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_217">I thank the Taoiseach for an unusually comprehensive reply.  It will bear reading.  As he is aware, the Sullivan report listed seven different stages at which the Attorney General himself ought to have been briefed on the statutory rape issue.  It only happened at one stage, namely, the initial stage of briefing counsel.  We know the issues that derived from that.  It is not a question of whether the case might have been defended differently.  The issue is that the Attorney General is the law officer to the Government who is personally in attendance at Cabinet meetings and ought to be in a position on matters of legal, constitutional or public interest to advise the Government in that capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_218">The best way to question the Taoiseach on this matter is to ask him whether he is satisfied that adequate procedures are now in place to ensure the State cannot be taken unawares by a judgment of the Supreme Court in a case of the gravity of the statutory rape case.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether any of the key recommendations of the Sullivan report have not been implemented or whether a decision has been taken to exclude any one of the key recommendations and, if so, why?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_219">Deputy Rabbitte correctly pointed to what happened in that case and what the Sullivan report recommended.  The relevant parties accept the CC case met the criteria of being an "important and sensitive" case — which are the words used in the protocols — such as to warrant reference to the Attorney General according to its office policy and protocols.  It identified several milestones in the evolution of the case of which the Attorney General ought to have been informed.  In reality, he was consulted only about the first, which was the nomination of counsel.</p>
            <p eId="para_220">The report instances the various relevant procedures and protocols in force, the policies in operation to ensure staff were aware of the requirement and that the office co-ordination arrangements provided further mechanisms to assist in observance requirements.  The report finds the reason the Attorney General was not notified or consulted was the result of administrative error.</p>
            <p eId="para_221">The report goes on to outline in the 19 recommendations the various issues it is believed can tie down all of these.  To answer Deputy Rabbitte's question, I understand all 19 recommendations are under way.  As is pointed out in the report, work on some began immediately in July, some in August and some in October.  I know other work is ongoing in IT.</p>
            <p eId="para_222">The report found that in spite of the failure to inform the Attorney General of the progress of the case, the case was processed in an expeditious, timely and conscientious manner.  It finds no conscious or deliberate decision was made to withhold notification.  The difficulty is that so many cases happen at any one time.  I read some of the background notes in preparation for these questions and saw that the number of cases involving challenges to the constitutionality of Acts of the Oireachtas or statutory instruments is 550.  The Deputy will agree this is a very large number, even though they are grouped into certain areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_223">It is important that every one of those files, not to mind the hundreds of others, is followed through.  The State offices dealing with these issues have large staffs and systems.  I am glad to see they co-ordinate their systems and do not follow a case only within the protocols of their own offices.  That is a major issue.  The Chief State Solicitor's office, the DPP and the Attorney General's office work jointly on these cases, perhaps with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform<b>.</b>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_224">The procedures have been put in place and time will tell how effective they are.  The offices have tried their utmost not only to nail down the difficulties of that particular case but to try to tie down the protocols.  On a two-monthly basis they look back and co-ordinate their efforts across the main cases they deal with.  I thought a small number of cases would be involved.  However, as the Deputy can see from what I stated, a huge amount of cases are involved.  At least they are grouped in areas and are not all over the place.  The groups include the large number of nursing home cases and challenges to the Immigration Act regarding children born to immigrants.  The majority fall within three different areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_225">Protocols were put in place which it is believed will allow a proper handle to be kept on cases and to allow the relevant bodies to remain updated as these cases move through various systems and the courts.</p>

            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_226">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about a different aspect of this.  He may recall the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, recently explaining on a public television programme the collapse of Dáil business on three occasions this term.  He linked it to a logjam in the drafting section of the Parliamentary Counsel's section of the Attorney General's office.  He stated it takes seven years to train a parliamentary draftsman.  It seems a long time but I believe it to be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_227">Is it true the number of entry level drafters has not increased since 2001?  I understand substantial increases were made in the advice section of the Attorney General's office.  Is it true three younger drafters left during the same period?  The result is the gap is filled by contract drafters, often from other jurisdictions not always compatible with our common law heritage.  This poses its own difficulties in terms of interpretation.  Sometimes, major differences in interpretation and style have led to judges being able to make inferences.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">Is it the case that foreign contract drafters are supervised by Irish drafters?  Does the Taoiseach know what is the proportion of foreign contract drafters as compared to Irish entry-level drafters taken in directly by the Office of the Attorney General?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_87">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_229">An ongoing problem exists in obtaining, holding and training drafters.  On a number of occasions over the past few years, approval was given to the Attorney General to obtain additional drafters.  In my reply I mentioned some drafters were brought in from the younger people assigned to other Departments to help in the legislative process.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">The issue of key experienced people is an extremely difficult one.  The Deputy correctly stated a number of drafters are contracted.  A number of them have become quite elderly over the past number of years.  Their service has been magnificent and not having had them would have created a difficult problem for us.  It is correct to state we had to seek drafters from outside the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">We have a problem getting through legislation.  I believe 21 Bills are on the A list at present and a large number of them are advanced.  The complexities of modern legislation tend to get more complex each year.  A drafter assigned to a Bill tends to remain working on it for a considerable time.  This means other Bills are put aside and put back.</p>
            <p eId="para_232">To the best of my knowledge there has not been a great number of people who want to take on drafting.  This is despite the fact that the salary grades were improved quite substantially in an agreement made a few years ago.  Even when they come in to the job, drafters want to move on to other areas.  Drafting is a tedious and very tension-filled job involving reviewing legislation.  I talked to a number of drafters over the years about this.  It is a specialist position.  Many of the people who have come in move on when they are still young.  The retention level of drafters is not good even though on the face of it the career looks fairly good.</p>
            <p eId="para_233">The advisory counsel's side is considered far more interesting and attractive than drafting on the Parliamentary Counsel's side and that is not changing much.  From what I know, other jurisdictions have the same problem.  Most of the people we get on contract would be retired people from other jurisdictions.  We are not managing to lure them from the other grades.  They are mostly people aged over 60 or 65.  That continues to be a problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_234">With regard to the last question, how many of the draftspersons have retired in the course of preparing Bills such as the charities Bill which we were promised in 1990 following the Costello report?  Could the fact that people retired be an explanation as to why we are still waiting?  There needs to be a radical rethink with regard to how we attract draftspersons.  I understand approximately 19 are employed at present.  Has thought been given to a formula for attracting more draftspersons?  What is the Taoiseach's view in that regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_235">I understand some of the drafting work of the Attorney General's office is being outsourced.  Is experience being lost among in-house draftspersons?  Is this a permanent solution or a short-term, stop-gap measure?</p>
            <p eId="para_236">In terms of morale, would it help if the electronic legislation system hosted and maintained by the Attorney General's office was accurate in its electronic form?  A person recently told me they were aghast at the inaccuracy of the electronic legislation system.  Is the Taoiseach aware the electronic version essentially cannot be trusted and that one is therefore directed to the hard copy?  Does it not make a mockery of the idea of having an electronic version of legislation if it must be checked on hard copy?</p>
            <p eId="para_237">Has the Taoiseach considered the Tasmanian Government system of designating its electronic statute book as the authentic version?  I am not sure if the Taoiseach is familiar with Senator Bob Brown and the Green Party in that part of the world but it has been very influential in this regard.  The electronic version is the authentic version in Tasmania.  Will that be considered more closely here?</p>
            <p eId="para_238">The Sullivan report found that the recommendations made in 1994 had been largely implemented by 2006.  I do not want to talk across the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, if he is busy informing the Taoiseach about something.</p>

            <p eId="para_242">The parliamentary counsel published approximately 175 Bills.  As a Parliament, we deal with more Bills than most.  In terms of productivity, the number of Bills the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel produces is higher each year.  However, while the staff of the office are working harder and producing more Bills, legislation gets more complex and is of a more specialist nature.  It is a difficult job.  Over many years I have talked to those involved in what is tedious work.</p>
            <p eId="para_243">On the contracting out of drafting, I have heard the opinions of several Attorneys General over the years who claim that despite contracting out the work to various people — probably the last ten Attorneys General have said the same thing — they end up having to do the work themselves in the office.  It certainly helps the work——</p>

            <p eId="para_248">I will raise it with the office.  It should be up to date.  We brought in reinstatement legislation which means there is a reinstatement process whenever the House passes an Act.  The latest Act should be available, which was the idea of the reinstatement legislation.  I will raise the matter with the staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_249">With regard to the Deputy's point on legislation, the broadcasting Bill is being published online for consultation and to allow the public to make their comments on it.  That will help the consultation process.  Parts of the charities Bill were drafted but the person working on one part was taken off that work to work on other legislation.  I understand that the individual involved is now working on legislation which the social partners are demanding that we deal with under the initiative.  There is a host of legislation in that regard.  The staff are trying to finish that legislation by January but it would be helpful if they were able to get a free run at this Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_250">The amount of legislation to be dealt with by the office is the difficulty, given the requirements of the House for legislation in so many areas.  The staff are producing more Bills every year but we are producing far more requests for legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_252">As the Taoiseach is aware, the online Statute Book facility is now preceded by a disclaimer which the user must accept.  It states that the Attorney General assumes no responsibility for the accuracy or up-to-date nature of the information provided on the website.  Given that there has been an IT report and a three-man recommendation in 1995 following the Sullivan report, we should have moved on from a position where the information published on the website, which is accessible to citizens, researchers, academics, legal practitioners, legislators and members of the Judiciary, is not 100% reliable.  Either the Statute Book is accurate or it is not.  We should be in a position to state that the content of the Attorney General's Statute Book website is accurate.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that?</p>
            <p eId="para_253">The Taoiseach will recall the famous Fr. Smyth affair, which was followed by recommendations for changes within the Attorney General's office so it would never happen again.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to the Mr. A statutory rape case.  I stated at the time and still believe it is incredible that the Attorney General of the day, who meets the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day on a regular basis, would not be able to at least state that, as case X or Y is before the Supreme Court and as the decision to be made by the Supreme Court, while it is for that court to make, will be one way or the other, the Government of the day will be in a position to act accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_254">During the statutory rape case, as the Taoiseach was on official business at the United Nations, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who was left here, told us there was no need for us to rush but the next day he had to say the Dáil would be recalled.  The Supreme Court made its decision one way and then made a revised decision a fortnight later.  Has that matter been dealt with in terms of the implementation of the Sullivan report?  Is the Attorney General aware of any sensitive social cases such as this, where a decision is currently in the process of being arrived at in the Supreme Court that might require the Government to act legislatively and promptly?  The Taoiseach does not want what happened in the Smyth case a number of years ago and in the recent statutory rape case to arise again and neither does anybody else.  Therefore the Taoiseach needs clarity of agenda and real information from the Office of the Attorney General for the Cabinet, particularly for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Has that been addressed in following the Sullivan report's recommendations?</p>

            <p eId="para_255">Each case is different.  In the CC case not all the procedures were followed.  However, all the work on the case showed it was processed in an expeditious, timely and conscientious manner.  Although the work went on, the Attorney General had not been informed.  Efforts have been made to improve procedures.  Some months ago when I asked how many challenges to constitutional Acts of the Oireachtas there were, the number was 550 cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_257">Yes.  Some of those were blocked around particular issues.  With 550 cases coming down the line, as well as all the other cases, it would be difficult for the Attorney General to be on top of them all, even with all these procedures.  Could one ever be on top of this?  However the procedures have been put together.  The more important point, as I said to Deputy Rabbitte, is regular interaction between the offices, and they have brought in procedures for that.  They are all busy fighting cases in the courts, and it is important that they sit down and go through the cases that arise.  The sheer volume of issues being challenged arises.  However, they feel happy that they have put these procedures together.  Only time will tell how they work.  As Deputy Kenny knows, there is no end to litigation.  They have tried to put together weekly and bimonthly meetings to keep track of this.  While I would love to make a commitment that this means nothing will ever slip through, I would be reluctant to do so.</p>

Does the Taoiseach have residual doubts on the Sullivan report's finding that there was no deliberate attempt to withhold information from the Attorney General and that there was no attempt at a cover-up?  If that is the Taoiseach's view, does he also agree the debacle led to a serious situation where standing law was struck down by the Supreme Court and replaced by flawed emergency legislation?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied this cannot happen again?  Is he satisfied everything that needs to be done can be done and that there will be no repeat of this debacle?  Can he give such an assurance?

            <p eId="para_259">I do not accept the Deputy's point, which he has made on two occasions, that the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 is flawed.  Although there are different views on this matter, the Attorney General is satisfied the Bill is not unconstitutional.  Otherwise it would not have been introduced.  Although I accept that many issues must be teased out, not least that there is a general dissatisfaction that there is a need to provide for a defence of honest belief as a result of the Supreme Court ruling, it is not flawed.</p>
            <p eId="para_260">I have answered the other issues.  The person who dealt with the case processed it in an expeditious, timely and conscientious manner.  There was no deliberate decision to withhold notification or information from the Attorney General, nor was there any suggestion of cover-up or concealment.  Under procedures and protocol the case should have been brought to the attention of the Attorney General.  It was not, and we know what happened.  We also know that over the period no convicted prisoner who was sentenced to jail for offences under section 1(1) of the 1935 Act was released from jail, other than Mr. A, who was released only for a few days as a result of the Supreme Court judgment.  None of Messrs. B, C or D, or any other convicted criminal, was released from jail.  The procedures have been thoroughly examined in the Sullivan report.  The Office of the Attorney General has worked diligently in the past four months to implement those recommendations in its office procedures and protocols, which are strict.  The Office of the Attorney General has also worked to develop better co-ordination and to highlight issues on a more regular basis.  That does not take away from the volume of work and case law it has.  Because the courts, including the Supreme and High Courts, have more members, the Office of the Attorney General experiences heavy workloads and pressure.  The last mistake was not one of a lack of procedure but an administrative error.  We have to understand that it can happen.  While it would be great for me to say these things should never happen, they can.  The Office of the Attorney General will do all it can to ensure these matters are rectified by having tighter procedures and controls in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service Bill was published almost five years ago, in the early part of 2002.  It is the view of the Minister and the Department that the structures to improve this legislation are considerably different from those of five years ago and it would be possible to introduce a far better Bill.  The Title will be the same but the Bill will have been comprehensively revised and the Minister will bring the relevant procedures before the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">The Whip is telling me that the reason for the change next week is that there is a committee meeting on the Judge Curtin case, in which the spokespersons are involved.  I welcome what the Deputy said about the Barron report.  We agreed that report would go to the committee.  I commend both Mr. Justice Barron and the committee, which is just coming to the end of its fourth report on this issue.  For all those who were very concerned about the issue, not just the families and relatives of the victims affected in the various Troubles, an enormous amount of work, research and detail has been involved.  Sometimes people ask whether there will be a tribunal or investigation into this.  Mr. Justice Barron has uncovered a significant amount of the relevant information and facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">This is a matter for the committee, but when it finishes the fourth report shortly, it will consider publishing an omnibus edition of the four reports.  On foot of this the Government is committed to taking the relevant action.  I would certainly welcome highlighting of the Barron investigation.  I am certain that the families and victims who were asked to participate in the process are aware of the amount of work that has been done.  It would be a good idea to discuss the omnibus report from the committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_336">As I previously stated, the strong position of the Democratic Unionist Party, with which I do not agree, frankly, is that there should be an election in Northern Ireland.  That is not a matter I can control.  I think it will create other difficulties.  However, if the party insists on this, the second largest party in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin, would also state there should be an election, although it would rather not have one.  If it goes down that road, it will be a different procedure.  We will still have to look at whatever the legislative changes would be.  We cannot do that until we see the work completed.</p>

          <from>Mr. S. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_339">In supporting these amendments, I believe the long-term care arrangements for older people are unplanned, inadequate, inequitable and underfunded.  All older people wish to continue to live in their own homes and, fortunately, the vast majority succeed in doing so.  They mainly live healthy and active lives, with some support from general practitioners, community care services, their families and communities.  They are able to make and implement decisions about their lives and do not need constant or sustained care.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">We are speaking about people who require long-term care.  Those who must leave their homes and enter long-stay institutional care are among the most vulnerable members of our society.  Our society is civilised, respects human rights and promotes human dignity.  It should be judged on the way the care is provided and the quality of life facilitated within the care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">There are major shortcomings in this regard.  Any objective judgment on our care system would be harsh.  We have a stated policy in the context of this section of the Bill.  It demonstrates that we have a stated policy which favours community or home care.  The practice makes such care extraordinarily difficult and effectively supports institutional care more than it supports home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">We do not have a fair and equitable system for financing care, and we do not have a fair and transparent set of rights and entitlements.  In the context of the Bill, the Minister has stated he is just regularising the situation.  He has also indicated that fundamental changes are proposed in legislation, which would reflect on many of the concerns and points expressed by other Deputies during the course of the Bill.  If we are to believe what the Minister has stated and accept that the primary piece of legislation will be in place before the next general election, why are we proceeding down this road and not putting all the resources of the Department into finalising the primary legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states the purpose of the subvention scheme is "to provide financial assistance to persons towards the cost of maintenance in a private nursing home".  The Bill defines subvention as a payment towards the cost of care and maintenance of a dependent person in a nursing home.  The 1993 regulations simply state that the payment of subventions was towards the cost of nursing home care.  There is a fundamental difference between this Bill and previous regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The financial assessment of an applicant's means is to include all income and investments, including life policies and any assets transferred within the previous five years, for nominal considerations.  It will also include up to 5% of the market value of one's house.  Some 80% of the income from the State non-contributory pension is also included in the means test.  In the previous regulations, assets may have been taken into consideration when taking means.  They do not state assets shall be taken into account.  In the Bill "the first €11,000, or the prescribed amount, whichever is the greater, of the applicant's assets" is also excluded from the financial assessment of means.  However, for the social welfare means test, the exclusion amount is €20,000.  The social welfare means test allows for earnings up to €100 per week to be disregarded.  There are further exclusions under social welfare, including income from renting a room where a person would otherwise live alone.  None of these exclusions is included in the Bill.  Furthermore, for the social welfare means test the principal residence is not considered in the financial assessment of means.  If one sells a house to buy or rent more suitable accommodation or enters the care of a nursing home, the first €190,460.71 of the sale proceeds are disregarded.  The Bill makes no reference as to whether such income will be considered for the nursing home subvention means test.  Let us be clear in the comparison between the Bill and other legislation.  The exclusion of the home where a relative is residing makes no provision for cohabiting couples in the same section.  This should be included in another section and an amendment is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The difficulty of setting upper limits for the income level and the valuation of houses in primary legislation poses major difficulties.  Given the spiralling cost of houses, should amounts be reviewed annually?  Reviews of eligibility can be made at any time and 60 days' notice can be given of withdrawal or reduction of subvention.  That is an inconsistency.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The limit of €9,000 on income before housing assets are considered for means testing is already exceeded by the State non-contributory pension.  Is this equitable and fair for elderly people?  What does €9,000 represent?  Should we believe the Minister of State's statement of 12 October 2006 when that "the HSE will not implement existing rules in such a way that people would lose their houses"?  Where is this reflected in the Bill?  It is not the Minister of State's commitments, nor those of his successor, that are relevant but the Bill.  If such discretion is given by the HSE, what is the use in setting up percentages in the first place?</p>
          <p eId="para_347">An appeal against the decision of the HSE will be heard by someone who may be an employee of the executive and who must comply with guidelines set out by the executive.  There is no independent appeals system or advocacy service for an appellant.  Both services are proposed in the case of other Bills.  They should be set up before the Bill is enacted.  The Bill should clearly state the decisions of an appeals officer should be reviewed by the Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">There is no reference to those in nursing homes with low dependency.  Reference is only made to those with maximum, high and medium dependency levels.  No further clarity is given regarding enhanced subventions or fully contracted beds.  It is easy for the Minister of State to give the impression he is doing something by referring to enhanced subvention and contract beds.  We all know that availability of enhanced subvention is minimal and fully contracted beds are no longer in existence in some areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Older people who raised their children, allowing them to be part of the Celtic tiger, cannot be cared for at home.  They cannot be given a commitment because of the waiting list.  I have attended the funerals of many constituents who were told they could be on a waiting list for nine years before a public sector bed became available.  They died at home rather than receiving care to which they were entitled under legislation as citizens of the State.  The Minister of State refers to implementing policy.  The Government made a commitment to providing 2,000 extra long-term public beds.  The health strategy referred to a lower figure of 800 but none has been delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">This section of the Bill allows a high degree of discretion to the executive.  The intention of a standardised system of assessment will not be achieved.  On the basis of comparisons with the means testing of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, efforts to introduce standardised eligibility criteria will be further frustrated by the lack of consistency in means testing across Departments.  This will result in allegations of unfairness and inequality.  This is the last thing we want for people concerned about their final years in the world.  The necessity of staying at a long-term, private facility means they have used up the nest egg and are faced with the threat — implicit in the Bill — of their house being sold over their heads.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Older people are not treated in the same way as everyone else.  A young child coming into the world is entitled to care and attention in a public hospital.  The care to which someone aged 65 years or over is entitled under the Constitution is not available.  If one has the money, one can go into a private nursing home.  There are three degrees of subvention for others but if one earns over €11,000 per annum, one has a problem.  If one's house is worth more than the valuation stipulated in the Bill, one is not entitled to a subvention.  House values in rural areas and Dublin are inconsistent.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The Minister of State and his officials are well aware of the problems encountered.  Court cases are pending on the issue of elderly people's constitutional entitlement to care.  Many reports outlining the need for action have been placed before the Minister of State or someone else in his Department.  The result is a commitment from the Government and the Minister to regularise the existing arrangement rather than deal with the problem.  This at a time when we are told the resources of the State are not always available, or there is a staff shortage.  The Minister of State should be ashamed.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">While the Bill is an attempt to incorporate a 1993 regulation in primary legislation, other legislation and regulations have superseded many aspects of the 1993 regulations.  For example, the assessment of a child's income was provided for in the 1993 regulations but ended in 1999.  It makes no sense to include old regulations in new laws, notwithstanding that the old regulations were bad law in the first instance.  New legislation requires new regulations.  The elderly are entitled to legislation that will protect them and provide the care and attention they deserve.  The Bill does not meet that need.  I fully support the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_354">I support the amendment in respect of the definition of the Dublin area.  The Bill sets a ceiling of €300,000 and above on the value of a principal residence outside the Dublin area.  An article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on 26 October stated the cost of housing in the greater Dublin area, including counties Kildare, home to the Minister of State and me, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, bucked the trend for house prices to ease off.  Instead they had increased by 14%.  If the average cost of a house in Dublin is €419,000 and the greater Dublin area extends to the counties I have named, will the Minister of State accept that it is necessary to reconsider that section of the Bill and agree to the amendment?  These counties form a commuter belt for people working in Dublin because of their proximity to the city.  There is no obvious reason not to accept that they form part of the greater Dublin area in the context of house prices.  </p>
          <p eId="para_355">The Minister of State has said the Bill is intended to provide in legislation for the decision made in 1993.  There will be no further legislation on this matter for some time and many families will suffer as a result.  If the newspapers report a percentage rise in house prices in clearly defined areas, it is difficult to understand why we cannot agree that the definition of the Dublin area should be extended to include the greater Dublin area.  One could then reflect on including the four local authorities in the four named counties.  I have heard no one say the prices mentioned in the report are out of line with reality.  The Bill will affect a senior citizen who owns such a house.  If, under the legislation, the Department does not recognise a senior citizen who owns a house in this area, that person's home will be sold over his or her head.  There should be no problem in accepting the amendment because there is a definite line around the counties to which I refer.  The figures are available at the press of a button to show how the commuter belt affects them.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">I do not see how the Minister of State can refuse to accept the amendment.  He was under pressure on Committee Stage to resolve this matter but refused to accept the amendment.  On occasions when I have discussed the Bill with him he has told me it is not the "be all and end all" of a Bill but that some changes have been made.  This is one change he must accept.  He should agree to consider this aspect of the Bill and recognise that it threatens family homes.  No member of the Government has said there is a mechanism available to protect the family home if the value of the home must be taken into account.  The cost of nursing home care in the areas mentioned is such that one can see how it would affect local families.   A person in receipt of an old age pension in any part of the country will receive €800 a month.  The cost of a nursing home place in County Kildare is €2,800 per month.  It will, therefore, cost over €100,000 a year to sustain a person in a nursing home.  If a person cannot receive a subvention and must sell his or her home, the price will only give them three years in a nursing home.  Allowing that a place in a nursing home will cost €2,000 per month, the yearly cost will be €104,000.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_181">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_359">I question these amendments' sufficiency.  On the final Stages it is worth questioning the Bill's essential constitutionality.  It is legally fragile in so far as it sets out to treat citizens in a different fashion, in a manner which could be construed as arbitrary.  Separate from the issue of strict constitutionality, other questions arise.  There is a real problem as there is such a significant departure from any rights-based approach in the legislation.  In identifying forms of physical dependency, the legislation purports to deal with the needs of a citizen.  On the other hand, it proposes to meet the needs of the citizen through a set of mechanisms.  This will create problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">When compared internationally the Bill is not consistent with several European conventions.  It will not stand up to a court challenge if a case is brought.  It is my expectation and hope that such a case will be brought.  The fundamental principle is that citizens are entitled, even in the scarcest of times, to be treated equally.  The 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains several crucial words, "the progressive realisation of one's rights".  One cannot structure an inequity of treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The Minister of State will be advised that he is legally entitled to establish some form of a means test.  That will not rescue him from the fact that people are being treated unequally.  These are fundamental points.  The only way of delivering a system, even if one did not have the surplus we have now in the State's revenues, is by treating people equally.  The legislation does not treat citizens equally.  That is its fundamental flaw and it will fall, rightly, on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The Bill eschews the principle of universality.  I accept that is an ideological position.  The Government, particularly its junior partners, rejects a robust citizenship founded on the principle of universality.  In ordinary language, this means each child is entitled to a decent education.  People must be treated equally in housing legislation, which has already been tested in the courts.  These principles have been established in different aspects of health care.  The system proposed in the Bill rejects universality and establishes a set of tiered qualifications based on the most dubious principles.  If one followed it from a rights perspective, one would expect to be moving towards the progressive realisation of care for an older person.  Accountability is not being offered.  One is burying different forms of discretion but the citizen does not receive a guarantee.  The system is not based on a principle of guarantee.  It is, therefore, moving out of the framework of any constitutional certainty.  It is simply bad legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Having been a sociologist for 20 years, I have spoken on occasion about the various academic work on longevity.  There is that great curve of life where one has no roles when one is born or dead and the great parabola when one is most active.  The longer one stays active in different interests, the longer one lives.  Few Members are willing to speak about the short period people actually live after they enter a nursing home.  It raises questions as to the degree of activity available to residents.  It raises questions as to the urgency of a nursing home inspectorate which is not yet in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">A most important aspect is when one moves from one's home to an institutional setting.  The Bill assumes that one can put a market value on a person's home.  It is assumed that it is available as an asset, free to go on the market and based on the market value in one region or another.  This principle would not last a day in court because of its highly arbitrary structure.  Older people moving to an institutional setting must make a choice as to what they must leave behind.  They are limited in what objects that have connotations of intimacy or are family-related they can bring with them.  One goes as a single person rather than as a unit.  It is a traumatic transition.  Most people visiting relatives in nursing homes will often tell them how well they are being looked after.  They are likely to get a withering look because the relatives in the nursing home know the difference between their current situation and that which they enjoyed in their own home.  Anybody who says to such persons that they must put a value on their house, that it is simply an asset, knows nothing about social gerontology and the aging process.  It is rubbish.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">In regard to the family home, there are several ways the obligations of the beneficiaries of estates and so on can be structured through the taxation system.  However, this is not the direction being taken.  Instead, nursing home residents must concern themselves, as my colleague, Deputy Wall, pointed out, with the price they got for their home, the difference between it and the current rate and the division of the sum they secured by the monthly charge.  They must ask themselves how long will it last and what is to happen when it is used up.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">There is a waiting list of five years at the St. Francis nursing home in Galway and some one third of those on the waiting list are more than 80 years old.  Some 15 public nursing home beds were made available in County Galway in the past ten years.  There are no step-down facilities in the county and the spare capacity in hospitals is being given over to private medicine, for private rackets in the sickness industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">All Deputies are aware of the situation.  We should agree in a cross-party way on the urgent need for an inspectorate and an enhancement of the level of nursing home care.  We all agree there are circumstances in which people need care.  However, I do not agree with the substitution proposed in section 3 in regard to the definition of need.  The problem is that if we are to meet the definition of need on a rights basis, there must be something that is coterminous between the assessed need of a person and the provision he or she receives.  For instance, three levels of dependency are defined.  If these are assessed externally, what will happen in the context of the institutional setting of the nursing home?  Who is to decide whether it is maximum, high or medium?  Will this be assessed by the inspectorate or otherwise?</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Even before Committee Stage, I noted a serious flaw in the Bill in the provision relating to those who will make an assessment of impairment, whether physical, psychological or social.  There are major deficiencies in regard to the social and psychological aspects.  Might there be a suggestion that environmental inspections could be followed up by other inspections and that this would be adequate?  It is an absurd prospect.  In the transition from a home setting to a nursing home assessments must take account of the whole person.  The definitions in the explanatory memorandum do not address this issue which was not dealt with on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">My attitude to this issue is straightforward and republican.  In a republic what should count is citizenship.  From that citizenship certain rights should be derived.  Nobody is saying everything one demands should be provided today or tomorrow.  However, the rights perspective, traced through economic conditions, should be based on vulnerability.  The State can be reasonably required to move towards the progressive realisation of these basic needs, whether in regard to children, the elderly, disabled people or other vulnerable categories.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">It is disgraceful in such conditions of surplus that this legislation should demand that the homes of elderly people must have a market value and that estate agents will decide their entitlement to nursing home subvention.  The estate agents who publish the average price of a house, whether in Dublin, the greater Dublin area, Leinster, Munster, Galway or elsewhere, are the ones who report victory every other week when a particular house breaks the magic figure of €1 million.  They are parasites who are simply massaging speculators, completely oblivious to any decent consideration of rights, needs or necessities in regard to young people, the elderly or other vulnerable groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I do not give a damn whether the value of a person's home exceeds some specified threshold.  It is an obscenity that the House should discuss the needs of older people in such terms.  The citizens of a republic are entitled to be treated according to a progressive realisation of their needs.  That is the basis of a rights perspective.  Consequently, they are entitled to be treated equally and to a service that is accountable.  Beyond this, they are entitled to an inspectorate and the dignity of assessment as a whole person.  They must not be sent to places where they will spend the remainder of their lives — less than three years on average — wondering whether the yield from their home, the asset value, will suffice and whether there will be anything left for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">If the Government has concerns about the beneficiaries of estates, it should have the courage to deal with that issue through the taxation system.  Will it be the case that the HSE in the different regions will approach the local auctioneer to discover the average price of a house in that location?  Will there be people wondering whether they should put half their house over the border into the greater Dublin area and the kitchen in Leinster?  All of this is an insult in regard to the care of the aged.</p>

One relates to the nursing home subvention scheme, the subject of this legislation, while the other is the funding of long-term care.

I remind him that the regulations were introduced by his colleague, Deputy Howlin, when he was Minister for Health and Children.  Clearly, he was not insulted at their introduction in 1993 and they have been used by successive Governments since.  Unfortunately, there is no bottomless pit of funding for schemes such as this.

Deputy Twomey's amendments were not accepted on Committee Stage because we have used the same definition of the Dublin area as is used by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government when compiling data on house prices.  It is logical to do so.  It is not feasible to begin including other areas in the definition because some geographical boundary must be drawn.  If we were to include the counties immediately surrounding Dublin, we would have to include the counties adjacent to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_383">In responding to the Deputies' proposals it is crucial that I clarify a certain point in taking into account a property for the purposes of considering subvention applications.  When carrying out financial assessment for the purpose of subvention, the applicant's home is not taken into account in certain circumstances.  Examples of this include where it is occupied by a spouse, a child under 21 years of age, a child in full-time education or a relative in receipt of certain social welfare payments or where taking 5% of the value of the residence into account could give rise to destitution or homelessness of a person closely connected to the applicant.  The last provision is a new one which was not contained in the regulations and allows the HSE discretion to take into account exceptional circumstances if and when they arise.  If none of these situations applies, 5% of the imputed value of the person's principal private residence is taken into account as part of the financial assessment.  This 5% is imputed in all such cases regardless of the value of the property and the thresholds on property were updated in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations 2005 from €95,000 for the whole country to €500,000 and €300,000 for the Dublin area and the rest of the country, respectively.  It is, therefore, not proposed to accept these amendments as we used the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government house price data to reach the figures of €300,000 and €500,000 and also used its definition of the Dublin area, so we intend to keep both of these for the purpose of consistency.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The funding of long-term care was mentioned on the different Stages of the Bill.  We have given the matter serious consideration and it has been examined inside out.  I realise there is an issue to be tackled, and we will do so.  There are proposals before Cabinet and it will make decisions on them in the near future.</p>

          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_385">I have no difficulty giving way to my colleagues in the Labour Party and will withdraw most of my amendments if we can take the family home issue out of this.  During Leaders' Questions the Taoiseach acknowledged that elderly patients will have to sell their homes because the HSE may refuse the subvention.  He agreed with what we have said all along that elderly patients may have to sell their homes.  This is basically a property grab by Fianna Fáil which the Minister of State fully acknowledged this evening after five months of trying to get it out of him.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">In a press release issued in October, the Minister of State said the income threshold above which subvention may be refused was €36,000 and the principal residence value above which subvention may be refused was €500,000 in the Dublin area and €300,000 outside the Dublin area.  The press release and this legislation state "may be refused".  Every Deputy will have come across at least one case in the past ten months where people have been refused subvention on the grounds of this provision even though it is quite clear it states "may be refused".  When the Taoiseach said during Leaders' Questions today that a person "may be refused" subvention, he was basically saying that one could read it as "will be refused" subvention.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">What is coming out on the final Stages of the Bill is that Fianna Fáil will take houses from elderly people.  There are no two ways about it; it is now official Government policy.  That is the only clarity we have received in respect of this legislation in the past five months.  As has been pointed out, patients have already had to sell their homes to pay for nursing home care.  It has happened at least three times not to constituents of mine but to patients of mine in the past two to three years.  The most despicable aspect of this is that when they have exhausted their assets, they have received no assistance from the HSE.  In fact, we have had to go begging and scraping for them to get a contract bed when their funds were exhausted.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">This legislation and the way the Government is behaving is a race to the bottom in terms of looking after elderly people into the future.  The Minister of State will not apply consistent standards across the country on the back of this legislation, rather it will apply consistently low standards.  He said the amount people receive in subvention is unequal throughout the country and that some HSE areas give more.  It looks as if the only thing he wishes to give is less subvention to every elderly person in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Deputy Higgins raised constitutional issues in this regard.  We saw what happened with the former health boards when the issue of illegal nursing home charges cropped up.  When people said they would challenge the charges in the courts, their fees were paid and they were told they would not be charged.  This is exactly how the Government will respond when court cases are brought in this instance.  It will suddenly drop the notion of expecting patients to pay.  It will buy off those it believes might cause it a problem but will attempt to screw every other elderly person from whom it believes it can get property.  That is what the Government is doing and it is shameful.  What is even more shameful is that Fianna Fáil does not have the guts to admit it is taking people's houses from them through the back door.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">If the Government had the courage of its convictions, which I doubt it has, it would have first brought forward its policy on funding care of the elderly into the future and would have told us what was to happen.  We have waited long enough for its policy.  I have press statements from the former Minister, Deputy Martin, dating back as far as 2003 stating that a Government decision on the O'Shea report, the Mercer report and funding care of the elderly into the future was imminent.  In 2003 it told us it would be fair but by 2006, the Government has obviously made up its mind exactly how it will fund care of the elderly into the future; it will take their houses from them.  The Minister of State more or less said that when he said the only aspect which worried him was how much it will cost.  He made direct comparisons between how much it cost in 1993 with how much it costs now.  He does not give a hoot about equality, rights and how elderly patients will be treated in the future.  The only aspect which bothers the Government is the bottom line.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said there were so many billions of euro sloshing about in the Department of Finance that the Government did not know what to do with them.  Obviously, it has changed its mind and has decided that the only way to keep the coffers full is to penalise elderly people and take their homes from them.  I will withdraw amendments Nos. 8 and 12.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanRyan" eId="spk_192">
          <from>Mr. S. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_392">The Minister of State probably did not have sufficient time to take on board some of my contribution on my assessment of the Bill but I thought he would have referred to some of the relevant points I made.  I referred, in particular, to the provision for cohabiting couples which should be included.  I made some other realistic proposals.  The Minister of State said he wished to be consistent.  However, he is being anything but consistent.  I referred to the social welfare means test.  If he wishes to be consistent, why does he not take that on board rather than have different standards in the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social and Family Affairs?</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I have listened to the representatives of older people, including Age Action Ireland, the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and other organisations.  Time and again, they have expressed grave concern in regard to the assessment of the principal residence of the applicant.  The assessment of the degree of dependency and means of the applicant brings us to the core of the issue.  Our amendment No. 6 reads "In page 7, to delete lines 20 to 48 and substitute the following: "(i) the principal residence of the applicant,".  The Minister of State can refer to 1993 but the situation has changed.  We have learned that more older people are seeking care and attention.  By accepting our amendment, the Minister of State would be taking on board the views of older people living at home and those in long-stay institutions.  Amendment No. 6, reads,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_394">In page 7, to delete lines 20 to 48 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_395">"(i) the principal residence of the applicant,", would deal with many of the concerns and anomalies that exist.  If one takes the approach of disregarding the main residence, one can then examine other ways of dealing with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I do not accept the argument that there may be people who will benefit from the sale of a house when loved ones have died.  That is not the principle at stake.  The principle is one of universality with regard to services and as Deputy Higgins clearly outlined, there are other means of dealing with income deriving from the sale of a family home subsequent to the death of the main resident.  That issue can be addressed and the Labour Party will draw up proposals to do so.  I urge the Minister of State to accept our amendment but on the basis of what he has said so far, I doubt he will do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_193">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_397">With regard to this group of amendments, I welcome Deputy Twomey's decision regarding amendment Nos. 8 and 11.  As I have indicated previously, I find greater favour with the amendments proposed by Deputy McManus, namely Nos. 9 and 10, but only in the context of our not being able to establish with the Minister of State and his colleagues in Government the absolute requirement of the exception of the family home.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">It is absurd to even suggest this is not a consequence that will be faced by many people.  As Deputy Twomey said, it is already a reality.  I have previously put on record in the House the situation of a family in my own home town.  There are many cases but one in particular drove the issue home to me very clearly.  An elderly lady had to go into nursing home care.  She had very little by way of savings but the family home, the simple, council-built home that had appreciated in value over time, was factored into her means assessment because none of her offspring was living there.  They were living elsewhere in the country and overseas.  The HSE's drive to force that lady to dispose of her home forced her adult children to face all of the effects of the loss of a parent, even though their mother was in a nursing home facility.  The disposal of the home and of all their mother's personal effects had to be endured.  The memories of their childhood growing up there had to be dispersed, displaced and disposed of.  I personally witnessed the pain of all of that and it was absolutely harrowing.  These were young adults who would come home to visit their mother and stay in the home where they grew up.  Now, because that home is no longer in the family's possession, they are faced with the added burden of the cost of accommodation when they come home to visit their mother in the nursing home.  This is already an expensive trip, as three of them have to make their way back to Ireland to do so.  They now have to come to their home town and find there is no longer a home for them to visit.  They are forced into hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation.  It is an absolutely dreadful scenario and that is what the Government is compounding.  That is what the Government will force more and more families to face.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">If one thinks ahead, the scenario is equally dreadful.  Thankfully, the lady is still alive but when she dies, where will her family gather to grieve?  Where will they gather to think back on the years of their childhood, the years they shared with their parent in the nursing home?  Where will the lady be waked?  There will be no home open to her neighbours, friends and community to come to sympathise.  What is the Government doing?  Does the Minister of State have any idea of the consequences of what is being proposed for the reality of life for families throughout the country?  This is the most poorly thought-out legislation put before us for some time.  I know it is not all the fault of the Minister of State.  He has been entrusted with the role and responsibility of having to defend the Bill but where are the drafters coming from, the people to whom the Taoiseach referred?  Where are they living?  How distant have they and those in the Department who advise on the preparation of such legislation become from the reality of life for ordinary people in our communities?  It is shameful and a disgrace.  The Bill is compounding a pain that is already in evidence and making the situation even worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I indicated during my contribution to the Second Stage debate that I welcomed the presentation of a Bill that would place the subvention scheme on the basis of primary legislation but what is it that we have before us?  If the Minister of State holds his current line, particularly in this area —  although that is not to say there are not other areas of the Bill which are seriously flawed — other Deputies and I will have no choice but to oppose the Bill outright.  People throughout the State, when they become aware of the reality and see the pain the outworking of this legislation will cause, as I have described, will also oppose it and the Government will deservedly face a very irate public.</p>

          <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_401">I must make the point that what we are doing here is converting regulations into primary legislation.  With regard to the financial assessment, we are not proposing any change here.  We are not proposing any great change in the way the scheme will operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">From the point of view of looking after older people, the Government has treated them very much as a priority.  We have seen that in successive budgets, with the old age pension increasing.  We increased the number of home care packages.  Last year we had 1,100 and have increased that this year by an extra 2,000 throughout the country.  These are things that have made a real difference and have improved the quality of life of so many.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">We are introducing the measures proposed today on the advice of the Attorney General.  We are criticised when we do not take advice.  Now that we are taking advice and acting upon it, we are being criticised for that as well.  With regard to Deputy Twomey's comments on funding, that is fine when one is in Opposition because one can be as carefree as one likes.  However, any reasonable person will accept that in proposing any scheme, one must be very conscious of how much it will cost.  I suggest that if he happens to be in the Cabinet after the next election, he make the same proposals.  He will see what short shrift he gets from the Department of Finance if he does not cost a scheme he proposes to introduce.  We are living in the real world here.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_657">(iii) except in exceptional circumstances, not sooner than 12 months after the commencement of the payment of a relevant subvention,".</p>
          <p eId="para_658">Every opportunity should be taken to discuss the Bill in as much detail as possible.  The aim of the amendment is to enable the HSE to allow patients to receive a subvention for a specific period.  The difficulty is that the payment of a subvention can be queried almost within months of a patient receiving it.  Subventions should not be reviewed for a certain period of time.  They should be treated like medical cards which can be issued for three to six months.  If a subvention is reviewed soon after it is given because information has been provided for the HSE which might not be true, it makes matters difficult for the patient involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Many of the amendments are based on the one issue.  I am disappointed the Minister of State is not reciprocating in any way with this side of the House.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, stated that under the new policy no one would be forced to sell his or her house and that the HSE would not implement existing rules in such a way that people would lose their homes.  This appeared on the website of Age Action Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The Taoiseach implied that funding for the care of the elderly in the future had already been decided and that discussions had taken place with mythical stakeholders.  I previously asked the Minister of State to identify these mythical stakeholders who had already decided it was perfectly valid to take the homes of elderly people in order to pay for their private nursing home care.  He did not answer the question.  It is clear that the words of the Minister to the effect that houses will not be taken from elderly people will have no value in years to come because they do not have any value today.  We have already pointed out that patients are being forced to sell their homes to pay for their nursing home care.  Therefore, her words have zero value.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">What will matter is legislation; that is what we are discussing.  The measly words of the Minister, the Minister of State and the Taoiseach will mean nothing when it is passed.  Will the Minister of State indicate who are the stakeholders with whom he had discussions and who agreed that homes should be taken from elderly people?  As he did not discuss the issue with anybody on this side of the House, it is clear that the stakeholders are not on this side.  Who are they?  Age Action Ireland stated its group was not involved and that it was against the legislation.  With whom has the Minister of State had discussions?  Who decided that homes would be taken from elderly people to fund their care?  We now know this is Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats policy but we do not know with whom it was agreed.  Fianna Fáil brings in everybody to discuss matters.  It brings in IBEC and the trade unions.  The elderly people who are engaged in this discussion would like to know who is representing them who allowed this proposal to go forward.  It is most important that the Minister of State answers this question.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">We are aware the Government parties have no respect for the Dáil.  They will be backtracking when this measure is reflected in the opinion polls.  It will be suggested not much will be taken from elderly people but there will be a difference between what the parties will state in their general election manifestoes and what is contained in the legislation.  The Minister can write on any website she wishes, including that of Fianna Fáil, that she will not take anybody's home, but it is already happening.  Her words and those of the Minister of State have no value.  What matters is the legislation.  This is different from regulations which can be and were interpreted differently by the CEO.  Believe it or not, in the past ten months, when we knew the legislation would be brought forward, the HSE has been more inclined to stop elderly patients receiving subventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">The subvention rates have been the same since 2001 and there have been no discussions to increase them.  An attempt to increase them might be made once the Government copperfastens the arrangements to deprive a large percentage of elderly people of the right to receive a subvention.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">The Minister of State must answer the questions asked.  I asked about the figure of 5% as far back as 11 May in my Second Stage speech.  The Minister of State avoided that question completely until he attempted to explain the situation in a press release issued before he was due to speak on "The Last Word" with Matt Cooper on 12 October.  No attempt was made to explain it clearly in the House.  While he is here, will he indicate who are the stakeholders with whom he discussed the issue and who agreed to allow legislation under which the homes of elderly people would be taken from them to pass through the House?  He should do so without further prevarication.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Families will have some job in obtaining a subvention under this legislation as the Government will take everything into account and ensure families will have to go to a solicitor to sign off or risk being locked up in jail for a couple of months.  If a family does succeed in obtaining a subvention, the elderly person concerned will deserve to receive it and hold on to it for a few months.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_668">I certainly support the amendment.  One must ask whether there is a balance of fairness between the executive and the citizen in a nursing home.  On the one hand, an elaborate set of procedures is laid down in the Bill for a person who wants to appeal against a refusal.  The grounds must be within a framework acceptable to the executive and a particular set of requirements must be followed.  On the other hand, section 7D states that at any time the executive may arrange for a review to be carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">The formulation regarding the executive is loose.  Almost immediately after granting a subvention, should it wish to do so, it may change either the degree of dependency or the level of means.  However, the procedures laid down in the section governing a dependant or a person acting on his or her behalf are more cumbersome.  This raises a further question about the human being involved in the assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The reason I support the amendment is the decision should apply for at least 12 months.  Otherwise, there could be an absurd situation whereby a person will be subject to this strange method of decision making on degree of dependency and then be vulnerable in having it redefined almost arbitrarily within an extremely short period of time.  As I understand it, all the amendment seeks to ensure is that a decision arrived at would apply for 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">I am regularly invited to be practical.  I would like to be practical about this issue also.  Let us suppose a hypothetical case concludes with a person being moved from one category of dependency to another.  Can I assume the contribution of the HSE will automatically change?  I cannot find any such guarantee in the legislation.  While one could find one's category has changed, one's liability has remained stable.  That is not in the interests of anybody.  The case can be made that it could work the other way but that is a separate issue.  This involves a person being assessed using multiple criteria.  In many cases there is considerable merit in leaving a decision stand for a period of time.  The rights of the person concerned included in a later section can be invoked better in such circumstances.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_205">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_672">I support the amendment.  It is critically important that when a decision is made it should apply for 12 months.  In many cases the battle in going back and forth to appeals officers to get the right decision for an elderly person can take almost 12 months.  The Bill gives the executive the right to automatically review a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The topical issue is taking 5% of the value of a property or house.  In reality, this will force many elderly people to sell their homes.  That is morally wrong and the Minister of State should review the matter.  The average price of a house price is approximately €300,000.  The Minister of State has stated, as the Taoiseach did earlier today, that if a house outside Dublin is worth €300,000, the owner will not be entitled to receive a nursing home subvention.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">Let me give as an example a semi-detached house valued by an auctioneer at €200,000, 5% of which is used, even though the elderly person concerned cannot liquidate or sell that asset.  If the house next door is sold at auction for €300,000 the week after a subvention is granted, under the legislation the HSE will be able to review its decision it made, even though the valuation will have been made by a certified valuer.  All of a sudden, the elderly person concerned will have his or/her nursing home subvention withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The rates of subvention mentioned by Deputy Twomey are appalling.  The maximum rate in County Roscommon is €308.  Last month the HSE decided it would not provide an enhanced subvention for anyone.  This will result in people living in poverty.  I know of one instance where a man lived in his home with his elderly mother who had to go into a nursing home.  The 5% valuation came into play.  He did not have any assets, other than the roof over his head.  Because he did not meet any of the criteria laid down, he had to try to find the money somewhere.  He committed suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The executive should not have such flexibility.  I came across a policy within the HSE on medical cards under which people were not told that they had the right of appeal.  A person may be granted a subvention and believe it will be be payable for at least 12 months.  However, the HSE will be able to review it immediately.  In many cases, people are not informed that they have the right of appeal under certain schemes.  It is important to have such a right.</p>

            <p eId="para_680">The right to a roof over one's head is one of the most basic rights a person should have and it is a right Sinn Féin believes is so important that it should be contained in Bunreacht na hÉireann, the Constitution.  No family should be forced to wait for periods of up to seven years on a housing list, as is the case in parts of this city.  Nobody should be forced to live in substandard rented accommodation for years because of Government neglect.  Nobody should be forced to live on the streets because of Government indifference.</p>
            <p eId="para_681">After nine years in Government, during a time of unprecedented economic prosperity, the undeniable fact is that the Government and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, have failed.  The Minister of State knows he has failed; he is acutely conscious of it.  However, rather than face the reality, he turns away and pretends, ostrich-like, that if he refuses to acknowledge the existence of a crisis, it will simply cease to exist.</p>

            <p eId="para_683">He hides behind a stream of selectively chosen statistics that I have no doubt he will regurgitate again in this debate.  He hopes that if he can throw up enough smoke and dazzle us with enough mirrors, we will believe that a Government, which writes its housing policy at the behest of developers, is interested in creating policy to deliver for people.</p>
            <p eId="para_684">No amount of spin will hide the facts.  There are 44,000 households on social housing waiting lists.  Social housing output as a percentage of overall annual housing output has fallen dramatically in the past four years from around 10% in 2002 to 5.8% in 2005.  Less than 5% of the homes completed in the first three months of this year were for local authority tenants.  Of the 81,000 houses built last year, only 830 were in the social and affordable sector.  With regard to houses which have been built, there has been an 11.9% increase in the price of new houses State-wide and a 14% increase in house prices in the Dublin area.  The average price of a house in Dublin in 2005 was €386,089; in 2001, the average price was €252,000.  There has been a 17% increase in the price of second-hand homes.  The Government is now 15,000 units short of the number of social and affordable housing it made a commitment in the national development plan to deliver by the end of this year.  If that is not a crisis, I do not know what is.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">The Bill put forward by Sinn Féin sets out a realistic plan to try to help achieve the NESC target of 73,000 extra social housing units by 2012, a target the Government is nowhere near achieving.  We want to amend the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2002 to oblige developers to provide 20% of social and affordable housing and remove the option for developers to make a financial contribution to local authorities in place of providing social and affordable housing units.  This will ensure that Part V delivers social and affordable housing in an integrated manner, as originally envisioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">The decision of the Government in 2002 to abandon any real effort to deliver social and affordable housing has had a dramatic impact across the State.  I will give a concrete example — a case study — of one local authority where the impact of Part V since the Government introduced the developer's loophole in 2002 can be clearly observed, using figures I received from my colleague, Councillor Joe Reilly, whom I hope will be able to raise these issues in the House after the next election.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">Meath County Council has received financial contributions from builders totalling just under €4.5 million since 2002.  The total number of social houses provided in Meath is three, all located in Johnstown in Navan.  In terms of affordable housing, 73 units were built.  To be fair, it should be noted that, in the six years since Part V was introduced, another 41 houses are "in progress".  This is the record of Part V in Meath: 73 affordable units, 41 in progress and a total of three social housing units, or one every two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">The total number of applicants on Meath County Council's local authority waiting list is 780.  Is it in this lifetime or the next that the Minister of State aims to eliminate social housing waiting lists?  Does he want it recorded that Fianna Fáil, the party he represents, is more comfortable with a system where developers can get out of their commitments by handing over cash than one that delivers housing for families?</p>
            <p eId="para_689">The difficulties do not stop there.  The erosion of the social sector means that the private rental sector increasingly acts as a refuge for people on low incomes.  In 2005, over 60,000 individuals in the private rented sector were in receipt of rent supplement, representing an annual expenditure of more than €368 million.  This means that every day more than €1 million of public money is shovelled into the pockets of private landlords rather than being used to build social housing.  This must stop.  We need a managed transition away from State subsidy of private tenancy and towards increased public resources for social housing, where tenure is by definition more secure.  If Part V were amended to provide social units to those in need of social housing, we would not have to spend €1 million a day of public money on subsidising the private rented sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">There are huge differences in the quality of houses being rented.  At a meeting with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul today, I heard about a house in a neighbouring county where a family is living in rat-infested accommodation which has been condemned three times.  This accommodation is being paid for by the taxpayer through rent supplement.  It is a disgrace that any family is being asked to live in such conditions.</p>

            <p eId="para_693">All of this makes the argument that Part V should be returned to its original purpose and the Government's approach to housing should change.  People need to be treated on the basis of equality, and parity in housing needs to be the number one goal in housing policy.  The policy of mixed tenure development should be to the forefront of any new plans for house building regardless of whether the development is in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown or Tallaght.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">Part V can help in the provision of high standard, quality accommodation for some of the 44,000 currently on local authority waiting lists.  However, amending Part V is only one step.  My colleagues will deal with other measures that need to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">Every person in Ireland has the right to live in security, peace and dignity, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.  Every person has a right to housing, regardless of income or access to economic resources, economic status or group or other affiliation or status, and every person has a right to freedom from discrimination in housing.  Sinn Féin is committed to bringing about a progressive improvement in living conditions for lower income people, and to allow for tenure of choice.  Sinn Féin aims to end the housing crisis, eliminate homelessness and ensure that adequate and appropriate housing is available and accessible to every person on the island without exception.</p>
            <p eId="para_696">It is time to put the needs of families before the needs of developers.  It is time to develop a housing policy aimed at delivering social and affordable housing, not one aimed at delivering higher profits for the construction industry.  The Bill will give all parties the opportunity to pick a side and take a stand.</p>

          <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_213">
            <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_697">Sinn Féin has a realistic alternative vision for housing that is based on our understanding that housing is a human right.  Our objective is to establish an equitable, balanced and fairly regulated housing market where the people who rely on housing in the social sector are catered for.  Reversing the small gains made in the original Part V in 2002 has done nothing to address the current acute housing crisis that exists in this State.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">I noted the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, this morning when he debated this legislation with my party colleague, Deputy Crowe.  The Minister of State claimed it was too early to judge the effect of the changes in Part V, which was introduced in 2002, because it takes five years for the various planning permission requests to work their way through the system.  I have no doubt the irony of what he was saying was lost on the Minister of State.  Fianna Fáil was happy enough to introduce the change in 2002, less than two years after it was set to deliver.  Sinn Féin argued at the time that because of the delays in planning permissions, and the appeal to the Supreme Court against the constitutionality of the legislation, the Government's real motive in introducing the current loophole for developers was to appease the construction lobby.  Although we said more time should be given to allow the benefits of Part V to become apparent, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, would have none of it and guillotined the Bill through the House as fast as possible.  As my colleague, Deputy Morgan, observed at the time, reading the construction industry's trade publications is as good a guide as any to forthcoming changes in Fianna Fáil policy on housing in particular, and it was clear that the industry wanted Part V changed.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">When the construction industry got its changes the ordinary working-class people were affected most by them.  Dublin is among the areas most directly affected by the chronic lack of social housing.  The housing crisis in Dublin is a direct result of the Government's cosy relationship with its developer and property speculator friends.  The dilution of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 at the behest of the developers has led to €32 million being paid to local authorities by developers buying their way out of their obligations to provide 20% of social and affordable housing in all housing developments.  Meanwhile the housing waiting list has soared with 43,684 families waiting to be housed.  Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has received almost €3.5 million, more than any other council in the State from developers buying their way out of their obligations, while the social housing waiting list continues to grow.  Some 3,519 families are waiting to be housed by the council.  These are disgraceful statistics.  Units need to be provided for low-income families and developers buying their way out of providing social housing units is legalised bribery.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">In Dublin City Council's area a similar situation exists, with developers trying to wrangle out of even the small obligations they have under the Government's changes.  They are forcing the council to go to court to try to compel them to meet those obligations.  The situation in Dublin is out of control.  Reports over the summer indicated that key public sector workers, such as nurses, fire-fighters and teachers, are being forced out of Dublin and other major cities as they cannot afford to buy a home.  Developers feel they are immune from the law and from moral decency, and have been issued a blank cheque by the Government for their actions.  If the Government is serious about promoting social inclusion in housing, it is high time the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, stood up to those developers who are buying or bullying their way out of their obligations to provide social and affordable housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">I understand that other Deputies will follow me.  Earlier today when I asked the Taoiseach about the purpose of this Bill, the reinstatement of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, he claimed the Government changed it because of demands from all sides, including here in the Dáil.  Although there was certainly pressure from some on the Government benches, the changes that were introduced in 2002 were strongly opposed in this House, including by Sinn Féin — we were not alone on that occasion.  We all know where the pressure came from.  It was from the developers and the speculators who contribute so much to the funding of the Minister's party.  It was one of the quickest turn-arounds ever for a political lobby.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">Let us examine the other side of this.  People with disabilities campaigned tirelessly for a rights-based disability Bill.  The final Bill was a bitter disappointment to many who had spent a lifetime working and promoting the introduction of rights-based legislation for their loved ones.  The Bill they secured in no way reflected the needs of people with disabilities.  They were treated differently from the speculators and developers, who lobbied for less than 18 months.  For this Government, rights-based legislation was never on the cards for those who needed it, but the Galway tent lobby was acceded to with undue haste.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has been in power since 1997.  Back then the housing crisis was developing and although it was clear what was going to happen as the economy grew, the Government failed to act.  The Minister and the Taoiseach failed to act.  They placed total reliance for the provision of housing, including social housing, on the private sector.  The Government's approach was and is driven by the drive for profits by the land speculators and the developers.  This has played into the hands of the lending institutions, which are profiting from the massive scale of mortgages weighing down on young families and — take note — into perpetuity.  That is the reality those young families face.  We pointed out that at the time and we stated that local authorities must be given a lead role in providing homes for our people, but that was ignored.  Local authority housing as a proportion of overall housing supply has fallen to a record low under this Government.  This State has one of the lowest outputs of social housing in the European Union, and that is an incontrovertible fact.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">The consequences of the housing crisis go far beyond the issue of accommodation.  Poor housing is a contributory factor to poor health among sections of our population.  The exorbitant price of homes has a knock-on effect for the care of children.  It leads to both parents in young families having to work to make ends meet.  The pressure on family budgets and on the demand for child care places is enormous.  More importantly, the quality of life for children and indeed for parents is adversely affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">Thousands of social and affordable homes would now be in place if Part V had been left as it was introduced in the Bill in 2000.  It can still have that important effect if now reinstated, and that is the challenge we put to the Government tonight.  We ask that the Government end the scandal by which a nation with an abundance of wealth sees so many people sleeping rough on our streets or living in overcrowded conditions, for example, with two families sharing accommodation.  All their needs should be met and this Bill will go some way to doing that.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">I commend the make room campaign which is being spearheaded by Focus Ireland, the Simon Communities of Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold.  They have said that with strong political leadership, a responsive policy agenda and adequate resources, homelessness could be ended.  The target date of 2010 for ending rough sleeping and long-term homelessness has been set by the Government, but that target will not be reached unless the Government prioritises social and affordable housing based on the needs of people.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">The make room campaign has stated that in recent years, the profile of homelessness has changed, with fewer people sleeping rough.  However, thousands of people remain without a home, many living for years in insecure hostel or emergency and temporary accommodation.  They say that turning the corner on homelessness will require much more comprehensive and sustainable housing solutions, and we absolutely endorse the make room campaign view of that.  One of the first steps in the solution to homelessness lies in the delivery of a needs assessment.  The campaign has identified that as a means of establishing the actual need of each applicant who is identified as homeless or in need of housing, and we support that proposition.  Individual solutions can then be developed based on the facts derived from that needs assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">The social housing stock in the Twenty-six Counties is inadequate.  Let the Minister acknowledge that fact.  As we stated previously, much-needed local authority homes have not been delivered.  Some 44,000 family units are in need of housing, equivalent to more than 120,000 citizens.  That is the issue that needs to be tackled.  I am telling the Minister of State not to roll out his statistics this evening or tomorrow.  We are tired listening to them from the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and the coalition parties in Government.  These statistics mean absolutely nothing to the people who need housing.  What we need is action and we are demonstrating that, clearly indicating to the Minister of State one step that can be taken.  We urge him to adopt this Bill and make it his own, and we shall gladly applaud him for it.</p>

It proposed that developers of land for housing should do one of three things, namely, make homes, houses or apartments available or sites or land available to local authorities.  Yet that brave legislation was filleted the moment the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, came into office.  I firmly believe Deputy Cullen looked the developers in the eye and blinked, because he filleted that legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">He introduced two opt-out clauses, to give cash to the local authority or to provide sites elsewhere.  That was a retrograde step which is fomenting ghettoisation in housing policy.  The one thing we should be doing in an ever-changing Ireland is trying to reduce ghettoisation.  We see the Minister of State with responsibility for housing trumpeting the fact he is selling off land and getting sites elsewhere, under the affordable homes initiative.  He is selling lands in Dublin 4 and 2 and providing lands somewhere on the periphery of the capital.  I do not believe that is a good policy.  What he should be doing is counteracting ghettoisation.  He should be providing housing units, whether in Nutley Lane, Dublin 4 or beside the canal in Dublin 2.  The Minister of State has a great opportunity to reduce ghettoisation and he is not doing enough about it, given the powers he has.  The changes which the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, introduced were a retrograde step in housing policy, because he let developers off the hook by allowing them to provide cash or sites elsewhere, which add to ghettoisation.  As regards the financial contributions, I do not believe many local authorities around the country have used that provision sufficiently.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">The Minister of State needs to provide local authorities with the resources to track down the developers.  Developers will use every trick in the book to try and wriggle their way out and a very smart law agent is required as well as good people in middle management in local authorities to get Part V delivered on.  Local authorities, including in my constituency in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, have lost out on potential contributions by not using the provisions of Part V to the best of their ability.  It is no good the Minister of State shedding crocodile tears on the subject.  He should be ensuring he is delivering on a commitment to provide affordable homes.  In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown under the 1999 scheme, one unit has been built so far this year according to the figures I have.  Under Part V, so far this year 11 units have been built, not something to set the crowds jumping for joy, and under the affordable homes initiative nothing has been built to date.  When one tots up everything that has been built in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown under the 1999 scheme, Part V and the affordable housing initiative, it does not amount to 150 housing units.</p>

            <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
            <p eId="para_716">By any standards that is not a decent accomplishment.  I really do not believe the Minister of State is making an impact.  Meanwhile, we are finding out that 16% of homes in the country are vacant.  The Government is providing tax incentives for holiday homes that remain vacant for 11 months of the year.  That is not the way forward in terms of housing policy and the Minister of State should look at the type of incentives being given and reconsider them in order to help the less well-off rather than those who are doing quite well.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">In many respects a triple tax incentive is being provided, particularly if one considers the relief available for rental property.  Builders construct accommodation for rental purposes.  They get tax relief on the cost of the rental units in the first instance.  They also get tax relief on the rent received.  To add insult to injury they get a third tax relief from the State, namely, a payment under the rental subsidy scheme.  While people are living in substandard accommodation and housing lists in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown have trebled over the last ten years, the Minister of State is providing a triple tax relief to some of the wealthiest people on this island.  That is not the right type of housing policy.  The measure of any social housing policy is how it helps the least well off.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">When one looks at the transition for those on rental supplement to the rented accommodation scheme, one finds that when local authority officials inspect the accommodation it simply is not up to scratch.  Whether this is due to fire regulations, the lack of hot or cold running water, damp on the walls or whatever, only 10% or 15% of the accommodation vetted under the rental accommodation scheme — I am subject to correction on this — passes muster.  The accommodation is not measuring up to the simple basic standards for 2006, a damning indictment of the Minister of State's housing policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">This is not about general housing, but rather about housing for the least well-off.  It is for lone parents trying to bring up a couple of children who are struggling to make ends meet and paying money to landlords day in day out.  Even that type of accommodation is simply not meeting the basic standards, and it is the most vulnerable who are suffering, whether parents trying to bring up children on their own, recently arrived immigrants or whoever.  Meanwhile three different types of benefit are being handed out to very well off people.  They are getting the double rent relief, capital allowances and rental supplement.  The well off are doing better out of this and the most vulnerable are suffering.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">I commend Sinn Féin for attempting to reinstate Part V of what was well considered legislation.  Fianna Fáil has moved to the right, particularly under Deputy Cullen's stewardship.  It sees the only way forward as the privatisation of essential State services.  I am concerned that the State has an enormously important role to play in providing the basics, whether in health, education, housing or in public transport.  The last few years in particular have seen State agencies starved of the essential funding they need and legislation filleted of the intentions that were there in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">We must also consider the issues raised by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and its conclusions as regards housing.  It suggested two very simple initiatives.  One was that local authorities should be able to purchase land at the existing use value, plus 25%.  The other was that we should be taxing the benefits of the increase in value that accrues from rezoning.  If one looks at any of the property supplements one can see we are not talking about millions or tens of millions of euro but hundreds of millions of euro in increased value.  The lands belonging to Sir Marc Cochrane in Shankill went overnight, by virtue of a stroke of a planner's or a county councillor's pen, from a value of €3 million to €170 million.   That is the type of profit being made by those who are inside the tent at the Galway races.  The efforts of the Government could be concentrated on a few slight changes that would improve the capacity of the local authority to build homes in the first instance.</p>

          <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_220">
            <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_722">I wish to share time with Deputies Catherine Murphy and Cowley.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to speak on this new legislation, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2006.  I commend Sinn Féin for bringing the Bill before the House, as housing is a significant issue for most people.  It is an issue for our young, our disabled and our elderly.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">I also wish to challenge the Government on its record, a disaster for most people.  It seems to have decided to side with the developers instead of working people.  I am here to demand action for our people, taxpayers and citizens.  We need the 20% portion of social and affordable housing as a matter of urgency, a matter with which this Bill deals.  I support this progressive legislation, as it gives our people a chance in the housing market.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">The Government seems to be obsessed with the market and the economy, while turning its back on our people and citizens.  Section 2 amends the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002 by restoring the original obligations which existed under the Planning and Development Act 2000 on developers to provide 20% of social and affordable housing.  It does this by removing the option for developers to make a financial contribution to local authorities in place of providing social and affordable housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">I urge everyone in this House partaking in the debate to support the rights of the disabled with regard to housing and long-term care in society.  They must be a major part of any housing policy.  This issue is a major part of my own political agenda.  People with disabilities should not only have their proper share of the cake, but they should also run the bakery with regard to housing and long-term care accommodation.  They deserve supports, our respect and to be part of this legislation.  I urge all Deputies in the House, and the Minister of State in particular, to listen to the voice of the disabled, especially on the issue of housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">I strongly support the Make Room Campaign, put together by a group of organisations working with the homeless.  It is campaigning to ensure people at risk of, or experiencing, homelessness will have their housing and support needs assessed and met.  I support the campaign for an annual output of 10,000 new social housing units per year to help to prevent and alleviate homelessness.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">We need measures like supported housing, care support and tenancy sustainment programmes to support people who have experienced homelessness.  I am calling for changes in the rent supplement scheme so people on low incomes can be given more help with meeting their housing needs.  We need new regulations of accommodation in the private rented sector covering basic standards such as safety, the provision of heating and cooking facilities and maintenance.  I am also calling for a range of poverty-proofing measures and poverty prevention actions across areas of education, health and services, which could help prevent homelessness in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">In terms of housing, I urge the Minister of State and all Deputies not to forget our elderly.  While maintaining people in their own homes is the preferred option of many of us, other options should be made available to older people to enable them to live in good quality accommodation suited to their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">The Government must wake up and increase the provision of supported housing for older people, and it should provide the revenue for appropriate supports and personnel to manage them.  The Government should create a dedicated housing advice service for older people to help them manage their limited resources and explore the housing options available, such as home improvements, adaptations or moving  to alternative accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">I commend Sinn Féin for this excellent legislation.  I urge all Deputies in the House to support it.  Housing is a key issue for our people and they deserve our support.</p>

            <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_732">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and state my support for the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">Kildare is an area where the full 20% portion is included in the housing strategy.  It is an area in which whole towns are under construction and there is every conceivable type of housing unit, including apartments, duplexes and triplexes.  The whole shebang is under construction at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">It is an area where there is an expectation, because of the extent of the development, that the housing list would be wiped out if this measure was working the way it is intended to work.  However, what we have seen are the crumbs from the table.  We have seen a couple of dozen units, at the very most, covering both affordable and social housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">There is a total lack of transparency around this issue.  Those on the waiting list for both social and affordable housing find it impossible to get information about availability, or when different housing will become available within new developments visibly under construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">Local authorities also seem to have wound down their own direct programmes and they have not been amassing land banks because they were depending on Part V to deliver on the housing programme.  It was supposed to be a cure-all.  Not only would it deliver on housing, but it would also provide for good integration.  Many people welcomed this, including myself.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">Land banks which would have been appropriated as part of community gain under development plans, for example, did not come about because developers complained there would be a double take if they had to contribute under Part V as well as community gain.  So there has been a loss in more than one respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">In Kildare, 1,500 families or individuals are on the waiting list.  That understates the case, as every day of the week I come across people who have been scratched off the list because they did not complete the assessment last year.  A 22-page assessment is pretty daunting for some individuals, and it is part of the reason people have gone off the list.  Where land is provided in lieu, the planning and building process must be gone through, which adds to delivery time.  Despite the fact that there is a fast-track approach for local authorities, it often takes them an excessively long period to actually deliver the houses.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">There is a price in human terms to pay, but there is also an economic price to pay, a point which has already been made.  A third of all people in private rented accommodation are being supported by the State.  As long as these people are supported by the State, that money will come from taxes.  It is an idiotic policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">Developers are not offering housing units, but apartments.  I can see nothing but apartments being offered on social and affordable housing.  Although it is very suitable for some family types, it is not suitable for others.  Very often in affordable housing, there is a significant amount of cost going towards management companies, etc.</p>

            <p eId="para_741">This is very enlightened Bill.  I compliment Sinn Féin on bringing it forward.  As far as I can see, action taken by former Deputy Bobby Molloy when he was the Minister of State has been totally destroyed and watered down by the very people who should be upholding what he was trying to do.  He was trying to do something very pure and act in a way politics and this House should be doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">He was trying to ensure that homeless people and people in need would have a house.  Unfortunately, his dream was destroyed by the same corruption which is destroying the Government.  It is all about money, greed and power.  This Bill would address that point.  If there is a collection of Independent Deputies after the next general election, they would certainly want to restore Part V in its entirety, and more.</p>

            <p eId="para_744">The demand for social housing is bigger than it has ever been in the history of the State, with 48,000 people waiting.  People who need housing are being put in a very bad position.  We find that the people who have money will make even more money.  While private housing is thriving, social housing is in the doldrums.  The level of house prices is such that one requires ten times the average industrial wage to get to the entry point for housing.  It is the reality of this country at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">We had many ways forward, such as the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  The National Economic and Social Council report is lying there, with its recommendations being ignored.  More resources for local authorities and housing associations are required.  The private rented housing subsidy of €250 is an open cheque book for private developers.  This is on the backs of the homeless and the destitute.  More social housing must be targeted at low income households and vulnerable groups such as the elderly, the homeless and the disabled.  We have the lowest stock of social housing in Europe, with the exception of poor Luxembourg.  This is the state of dear old Ireland in 2006.  Where has Fianna Fáil gone?  Is it the party that will look after the poor and the vulnerable or is de Valera's dream gone down the Swanee?  NESC recommends an increase from 127,000 houses to 200,000.  We can now see a new generation of drifters, moving from one private landlord to another.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">This country has been asset-stripped of social housing.  We need more resources now.  Does the Government agree with NESC?  If not, it should forget about the council but if the Government agrees, it must do something about the situation.  The targets were identified in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 but they have not been met.  There is a future but I am not sure the Government is prepared to go down the right road.</p>

            <p eId="para_747">I oppose the Bill but wish to clarify the Government's position regarding the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act introduced in 2002 and particularly how it impacted on the provision of social and affordable housing.  There has been much misinterpretation of Part V since its introduction.  I have arranged for my Department to prepare a short Part V fact sheet which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">It is the view of the majority of observers that Part V is a key measure in providing housing for all the community, especially those in need of social and affordable housing.  For the first time it made the community's needs for social and affordable housing a material planning consideration that a local authority is obliged to take into account when preparing its housing strategy, formulating development plan policies and deciding on residential planning applications.  Part V places a statutory obligation on local authorities to ensure that sufficient land is zoned for housing in their development plans to meet the projected housing requirements over the period of the plan.  A set percentage, up to 20%, of residentially zoned land must be reserved for social and affordable housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">Each planning authority is required to prepare a housing strategy that covers the period of the development plan.  The housing strategy forms an integral part of the development plan and acts as a cornerstone for future housing policy within the functional area of the authority.  Local authorities set out the options for compliance with Part V in their housing strategies.  Through the 2002 amendment, they are enabled to develop different preferred options.  In effect, local authorities determine what they want from developers to meet the need for social and affordable housing in their area.</p>

A Government committed to enabling home ownership for as many people as possible could not turn a blind eye to the problem.

            <p eId="para_773">No one could argue that this group did not represent a broad range of relevant interested parties from whom balanced and practical recommendations for improvement could be expected.  The review concluded that greater flexibility in the operation of Part V was required.  Measures to achieve this were contained in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002 that Deputy Crowe is now proposing to abolish.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">The requirement for the provision of social and affordable housing in new developments contained in the original Act has not been deleted or removed.  The primary requirement of Part V, which has remained unchanged since its introduction in 2000, is the transfer of land on-site.  The transfer of housing units, which is my preferred option and the preference of many local authorities and developers, is one of the options to the transfer of land on-site.  We have made it clear to local authorities and developers that we seek housing units.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">The 2002 amendment provides additional ways in which applicants for residential planning permission may comply with the requirements of Part V.  Instead of reserving land or providing sites to the local authority within the proposed development, applicants can now reach an agreement with the local authority to reserve land or to provide houses or sites at another location, to make a financial contribution that will be used for the provision of social and affordable housing, or to agree to a combination of any of these options.  The money collected to date — €38 million — has been ring-fenced for housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_835">While a financial contribution is a legitimate option, it is a matter for the local authority to accept or reject the offer, having regard to its housing strategy and whether it constitutes the best use of the resources available to it.  The developer may propose, but it is the local authority which decides.  When doing so it is bound to consider what is statutorily laid down and the best way of meeting the requirements identified in its housing strategy.  That point must be clear.  The developers do not decide.  The developers may offer cash or land or houses elsewhere, but the local authority makes the decision.  A cash contribution is in lieu of a percentage of the land that is subject to the planning application and not in lieu of housing units.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">There were two main policy motives behind Part V of the Act, to increase the supply of sites for social and affordable housing and to have a good distribution of sites for social integration.  Part V is beginning to deliver on its promise.  Up to end of June 2006, 2,787 homes were acquired under Part V, while 3,801 dwellings were under construction and a further 4,109 were planned on foot of agreements with developers.  Some 51 land transfers to local authorities have been completed involving 40 hectares and a further 259 partially or fully serviced sites have been transferred to local authorities and voluntary housing bodies.  Up to €38 million has been received in lieu of lands.  Proposals to develop the lands and spend the moneys received are in train in many local authorities.  This will deliver many more houses.  Even at a low density of 25 units per hectare, these sites and lands will result in additional output of 1,000 units on the land transferred.  I hope the local authorities will come forward quickly with their plans to build social housing on these lands.</p>

            <p eId="para_844">It is important to stress that not all housing output in the State is subject to Part V.  Regularly, the mistake is made that in viewing output under Part V one simply applies a percentage to the total overall housing output to determine the Part V contribution.  This is not the case.  The misreading of the matter has led many to jump to erroneous conclusions and wild pronouncements about what Part V should be achieving.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">Part V is restricted to multiple housing developments on land zoned for residential use, or a mixture of residential and other uses.  The bulk of all housing developments, therefore, are not subject to Part V.  It does not apply to planning permissions granted prior to the introduction of Part V, many of which developments have been built in the past several years nor to planning applications on unzoned land or to developments of four units or less.  Normal planning permission is valid for five years.  Some large estates in large urban areas have seven and ten year planning permissions.  It will take time for some of these old planning permissions to work through the system.  As the new planning permissions are coming in, Part V will be a significant take from those developments.</p>

Despite a Government promise to assist the voluntary housing sector to achieve the target of 4,000 accommodation units per annum, as envisaged under the national development plan, only 600 voluntary housing units were completed in the first half of this year.

They are sometimes able to enter into arrangements with the planning office to enable them — legitimately, under the 2002 Act — to avoid having to set aside 20% of their developments for social and affordable housing, as provided for in the Government's original legislation.  This Bill simply seeks to have the Government restore the 2000 Act as it was originally introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">Builders realise that giving over 20% of units in a development in a highly sought after area to social and affordable housing will reduce the price they will get for the other units.  The result of the opt-out clause in the 2002 Act is that house prices are kept artificially high by buyers, who wish to live where there is no social and affordable housing.  This clause also defeats the Government's stated objective of facilitating a social mix in communities.  It continues to be the case that social and affording houses are built only in certain areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_891">There may be some short-term gain for the Government in taking such a populist approach but it is poor policy in the long term.  The Government, however, seems unconcerned about the long-term consequences.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">It is incredible that under the 2002 Act, a local authority can take land in any area under its jurisdiction in lieu of the provision of 20% of units in a new development for social and affordable housing.  In County Galway, for example, the developers of new schemes in Oranmore and other places have reached agreement with the local authority to provide land in places such as Headford or Glenamaddy, 30, 40 or 50 miles from the prime residential areas close to Galway city.  This is a ridiculous situation.  People who avail of social and affordable housing and work in Galway city spend hours travelling to and from their homes in Headford, Glenamaddy or Williamstown or wherever else the developer can secure agreement from the local authority to give land in lieu of setting aside 20% of units in their developments in the much sought after areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">Fine Gael remains concerned at the lack of protection awarded to residents and tenants and has published three Private Members' Bills on the subject.  Each of them was rejected by the Government but we pledge once again to implement them if elected to Government.  The Housing (Staged Payments) Bill 2006 is designed to eliminate the practice of customers being forced to make staged payments for houses in estates throughout the State.  This practice, which is estimated to cost consumers up to €175 million per annum, is a blatant anti-consumer activity which fundamentally undermines and weakens the position of consumers purchasing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2006 is designed to end the scourge of unfinished housing estates by ensuring developers who did not live up to their responsibilities in regard to a previous development will not receive permission for any future developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2006 allows for the regulation of management companies and their agents in face of reports that new home owners are faced with poorly maintained communal areas, inadequate provision for sinking funds and a total lack of transparency in regard to how rapidly rising management fees are spent.  In Galway city and county, developers are obliged under a condition of their planning permission to establish management companies in housing estates comprising only houses as well as those which include apartments.  This was never meant to be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">The building company is now setting up the management company and the two are one and the same.  Householders are being penalised for services that should be provided by the local authority.  I do not pay management company fees in the estate in which I live in Galway city.  However, my neighbours across the road in Roscam pay exorbitant fees to live in exactly the same type of estate.  Many of them are young people in their first homes.  The Government is doing nothing to help such people.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">I am absolutely astonished at the farce that was the Minister of State's speech.  It is no wonder he was interrupted so often by the proposers of this Bill.  I hope he does not stand by what he said.</p>

            <p eId="para_899">This Bill will restore the <i>status quo</i> as set out in the original 2000 Act.  The key issue for the public is that we are in the midst of a significant housing crisis.  This is particularly difficult for some categories of people, such as first-time buyers and separated people in dire need of decent accommodation.  I listened to the Minister of State’s speech with interest but heard no mention of the rental allowance scheme, RAS, which was trumpeted with so much fanfare by him and his Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">The reality is that it is the Government's policy to provide long-term rented accommodation rather than social housing, contrary to the policies of all Governments since the foundation of the State.  The Minister of State's view is that the RAS will meet the long-term needs of those in need of social and affordable housing.  This is unacceptable to those people and to the public in general.  He has millions of euro which he has failed to spend.  The Minister of State is quite right — he has not been able to spend this money because he is not giving local authorities that wish to use the rental accommodation scheme to put people into long-term accommodation which it may have found or sourced for them in places like Drogheda and other areas.  He will not allow them to pay the rents asked.  Last year of the €16 million available, he spent approximately €6 million.  I do not have the picture for this year but I am sure it is every bit as bad.  The Minister of State is failing to look after single people and those who might be starting off their family lives before they buy their own homes.  His policy is an absolute failure.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">The Government also baulked at affordable housing.  The Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway races is so full of developers, it is afraid to stand up to them.  It changed the legislation because the builders said it was not popular with them.  Fianna Fáil took on board their views, watered down the Act and made it easier for them to get out of their responsibility, that is, the social responsibility of mixed housing, where social, affordable and other housing are mixed.</p>

            <p eId="para_905">There is much logic to what I am saying now because it is based on fact.  Fianna Fáil bowed its head to the builders in its tent at the Galway races.  The Minister of State can dress it up any way he likes but that is the truth and the Government is not delivering.  No matter what argument the Government puts forward, it is not meeting the housing needs of people.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">The Minister of State spoke about affordable housing in Dublin.  He should tell me where it is and who is buying it.  People from his constituency are living in Louth, Meath, Kildare and Portlaoise, and are moving out of Dublin city.  The Minister of State is making it impossible for a generation of young people in Dublin to live in and buy an affordable house in the city.  It is not happening under his regime because the Minister of State is not doing his job.  People are moving out of the city.  Young people are spending long hours commuting because they have not been provided with a public transport network.  They are unable to live a decent, normal life.  They work 12 to 13 hours per day and never see their families.  One case study done in County Meath showed that young parents do not have quality time with their very young children.  That is the type of society the Government is building and it is not acceptable to us.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">The Government has refused to make its spatial strategy work.  It is building everything around Dublin.  It does not have a strategy to deal with moving population and jobs out of the main city, Dublin, to the provinces and the west to build up Limerick, Cork, Waterford and other places.  The Government is an absolute failure.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">What is working in the heart of Dublin city is the Dublin Docklands Authority.  It has a very effective housing policy which the Government does not have.  It has social, affordable and private housing in the same blocks and everybody is happy with it because it is being properly managed.  Fears some people might have of a dysfunctional family or a family involved in drugs in their apartment block are being dealt with radically and properly.  If people misbehave, their lease is taken from them and they are not allowed to continue to live in the block.  If we are to have a true social mix, we need proper social management and people who may be dysfunctional or anti-social must be dealt with properly.  That is how it should be done and not the Fianna Fáil way of saying "yes" to builders in the tent at the Galway races.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">What is wrong with the Government is that it is not capable of standing up to the vested interests.  By not doing so, it is failing in its duty of care to provide proper, affordable and decent housing for people.  It demonstrates a lack of nerve and commitment.  Despite all the talk opposite about socialism and change, the way the Government treats young people who cannot buy homes and the elderly in nursing homes, some of whom have experienced appalling cases of neglect under the Government's watch, shows that it is in the hands of developers and is not thinking of the needs of the people, which are not being met.  That is where the Government is failing.</p>

            <p eId="para_910">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I wish to raise a number of specific issues, the first being the affordable housing scheme.  As the Minister of State knows, the affordable housing scheme is aimed at supplying affordable housing through local authorities.  It has been successful in some parts of the country where it has been taken up but in other parts, there is not a huge demand for the scheme.  The scheme is basically targeted at low to middle income couples and primarily first-time buyers.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">There is a specific problem in County Roscommon in regard to low cost or affordable sites.  A scheme was promoted to try to give young couples the opportunity to build their own homes on a developed site at a relatively low cost.  The difficulty is that while the affordable housing scheme has statutory backing, there is no statutory basis for the affordable site scheme.  There is a new housing estate in Roscommon town which is half built.  Some young couples were fortunate enough to get in early and have their houses completed but others who had some capital available built their houses to roof level where they remain.  Other young couples who purchased, or who are in the process of purchasing, the site from the local authority cannot get started.  The local authority made a condition that they must have provisional approval from a bank or building society to get the site but the banks will not allow the couples to draw down the mortgages.  While the provision of affordable sites in towns such as Castlerea, Ballaghaderreen, Boyle and Roscommon town——</p>

            <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_913">They went to all the lending institutions, none of which will approve mortgages for any of the couples for an affordable site.  The lending institutions have stated that there is no statutory basis for affordable sites.  The local authority has gone out of its way and has waived its charge in regard to the recoupment of moneys should the site or property be sold on within a 20-year period.  It has agreed to deeds of postponement, yet the banks have not found these acceptable.  I ask the Minister of State to resolve this issue which probably requires amendment of the primary legislation.  It is causing considerable financial difficulties for many young couples in County Roscommon.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">I do not believe this anomaly has arisen in any other local authority area.  It did not arise in County Roscommon until now but for some unknown reason, the lending institutions are not prepared to provide mortgages.  As I said, there are instances of houses built to roof level, yet people cannot draw down mortgages.  Much capital is tied up——</p>

            <p eId="para_916">It has happened with all the financial institutions.  They have all refused to provide mortgages.  Once one made the decision, they all backed it up.  They cannot give a reason but because one lending institution refused to provide mortgages, they have all refused.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">I wish to bring to the Minister of State's attention the issue of anti-social behaviour, particularly in regard to voluntary housing associations.  While local authorities have strong powers under section 62 of the Housing Act 1966, that same provision does not apply to voluntary housing associations.  The 1997 Act included anti-social behaviour under exclusion orders but for such an order to proceed, it must go through the courts system.  It must be evidence based and proof must be provided.  Under the 1997 legislation, the judge has the discretion as to whether to enforce the exclusion order.  Under the 1966 Act, that was not required in regard to a local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">I have come across a couple of instances in the case of voluntary housing associations where there are huge problems of anti-social behaviour among two tenants.  However, the locals and residents are afraid to provide the evidence in case of victimisation.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the legislation in that regard.</p>

            <from>Ms F. O’Malley</from>
            <p eId="para_919">The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, published yesterday, marks a significant milestone in global co-operation.  The report should be compulsory reading for every Government in the world.  The threat of climate change is global and the response must be on a global scale.  The comprehensive research conducted by Mr. Nicholas Stern is of such international significance and application that it is important we in Ireland take the opportunity to discuss it and I welcome that opportunity tonight.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">Economics do not change with international boundaries.  We have much to be thankful to the British for and we do not need to conduct our own research into the phenomenon now.  This report provides the evidence, as if we need it, of the economic cost of global climate change.  It is important that we respond to and act upon the findings of the review.  It is comforting to note what the author said yesterday:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_921">The conclusion of the review is essentially optimistic. There is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, if we act now and act internationally.  Governments, businesses and individuals all need to work together to respond to the challenge. Strong, deliberate policy choices by governments are essential to motivate change.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_922">But the task is urgent.  Delaying action, even by a decade or two, will take us into dangerous territory.  We must not let this window of opportunity close.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">It is not too late.  That is the message, essentially, but we must act now.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">Our Kyoto obligations are indeed onerous.  That our economic growth took place between the benchmark year of 1990 and the present accentuates the challenge before us.  However, this fact does not absolve us, particularly those of us in government, of the responsibility to implement policies which will permit us to respond positively to the task before us.  The cost of doing nothing is prohibitive.  Risk modelling forecasts a minimum cost of 5% of global GDP, rising to a possible 20%.  In contrast, Mr. Stern predicts that the cost of taking action to reduce the worst effects of climate change could be limited to 1% of global GDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">Tackling climate change will have consequences for our lifestyles.  Should we continue to be able to take flights with impunity?  The review suggests that the carbon costs of our actions should be transparent to increase our awareness of the problem and I would welcome that move.  Developing new, cleaner and more efficient technologies offers enormous opportunities for Ireland.  As has been stated on numerous occasions, we are ideally located to develop wind energy in particular.  We could realise my own personal ambition of making Ireland the research capital for renewable technologies.  We must have that ambitious target.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">We must take action to stimulate energy efficiency.  We must inform and educate people about the cost of their lifestyles so they can respond to the challenge.  Last year, when measures were taken in the budget in this area, people could not get enough.  People will respond to measures to create efficiencies, particularly those that will make their homes more energy efficient.  I hope the forthcoming budget will go a step further to meet the appetite that is clearly there among people.  We must realise that people want to change.  If we inform and educate them about the cost of climate change, they will want to take mitigating measures themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">Tackling climate change is a pro-growth strategy.  Ignoring it will ultimately undermine economic growth.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. B. O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_928">I thank Deputy O'Malley for raising an appropriate, pertinent and opportune issue and, as always, for making an incisive contribution to the discussion.  I am glad to have an opportunity to respond to the Stern report.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change published by the British Government this week puts the global warming debate centre stage in economic terms and reminds all countries that the costs of inaction far outweigh the cost of tackling climate change now.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">The review stresses that global climate change is an international problem and that the actions required to tackle the issue effectively must be multilateral.  Any one country is only part of the problem.  However, a sustained and effective collective response is necessary from all countries to avoid the worst effects of climate change in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_931">The review suggests that three elements of policy are required for an effective response.  The first is carbon pricing, through taxation, emissions trading or regulation, so that people are faced with the full social costs of their actions.  The aim should be to build a common global carbon price across countries and sectors.  The second is technology policy, to drive the development and deployment at scale of a range of low-carbon and high-efficiency products.  The third element is action to remove barriers to energy efficiency and to inform, educate and persuade individuals about what they can do to respond to climate change.  A shared understanding of the nature of climate change and its consequences is critical in shaping behaviour, as well as in underpinning both national and international action.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">Within the EU, Ireland  is performing well in terms of greenhouse gas emissions relative to other member states and our position is by no means the worst in the EU.  Ireland ranks mid-table with seven of the EU 15 further away from their Kyoto Protocol targets than us. <i>Per capita</i> emissions, while high, are not much higher than in many EU countries.  Ireland’s <i>per capita</i> carbon dioxide emissions were approximately 11 tonnes in 2004 compared to an EU 15 average of nine tonnes.  Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Luxembourg had higher <i>per capita</i> CO2 emissions than Ireland.  Most importantly, Ireland has achieved a decoupling  of its emissions from economic growth, so that while our emissions grew by 23% since 1990, our economy grew by almost 150%.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">The challenge of global climate change is a critical element of the global and EU energy landscape, along with the backdrop of high energy demand and volatile oil and gas prices.  The energy policies we adopt for the future must play a substantial role in Ireland's response to this issue.  The principal policy options set out in the recent Green Paper on energy are designed to deliver a more sustainable energy future for Ireland.  These are well aligned with the review of the national climate change strategy, Ireland's Pathway to Kyoto Compliance, published by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche.  As part of an overall strategy for the energy sector, these principles stress the importance of increasing our use of renewable energy as the key to sustainability and future security of supply.  We must also tackle energy demand itself through systematic energy efficiency strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">The energy Green Paper envisages an ambitious target of 30% of electricity produced by renewable energy by 2020.  There are differing views on whether such a target is too much or too little, but it is proposed as a realistic ambition and one for which a solid foundation has been laid with the recently announced REFIT programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">The Government intends that by 2020 the best commercial ocean energy technology should be Irish.   Our ocean energy strategy is aimed to position us at the cutting edge of development.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">Bio-fuels and biomass will play a major role by 2020, underpinned by the new bio-energy strategy that is led by the ministerial task force.</p>

The recently launched national energy efficiency campaign, The Power of One, is aimed at encouraging such behavioural change.  The agenda will include setting higher standards, regulating for change and, where necessary, incentivising change.  The campaign will also target individual sectors and for example, the public sector must set the pace.</p>

            <p eId="para_941">My motion concerns the need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to state what measures have been taken to determine the circumstances regarding the disappearance of an Irish citizen.  As the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is aware, it is extremely alarming that an Irish woman should disappear without trace in Medjugorje.  Ms Winnie Brady travelled to Medjugorje at the beginning of September with a group of Irish people on a religious pilgrimage.  As it was not her first time there, she had a reasonable knowledge of the area.  Although her disappearance was reported to the police on 6 September, she may have been missing from either 4 or 5 September, as she had not been seen on those days.  Hence, there was a potentially serious delay of a full 48 hours in reporting her disappearance that could have been the critical period for the beginning of a police inquiry.  It also transpires that none of the Irish people who accompanied her was questioned by the local police.  Moreover, the fact that Winnie Brady, who was a heavy smoker, left her accommodation without her cigarettes suggests she did not intend to go far.  Furthermore, it transpires that approximately eight people have gone missing in Medjugorje over the years, some of whom were Irish, and have disappeared without trace.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">Tom Daly, a policeman with the European monitoring mission, has been helpful to the family.  The mission is in regular contact with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs who have kept family members informed of developments.  Despite this however, the family is extremely frustrated.  Nearly two months have now passed and family members fear the worst for their loved one.  They even fear there may be a serial killer operating in the area.  They are most unhappy with the response from the local authorities and police.  Most of all, they want to know what happened to Winnie.  They want closure, even if it means bad news.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">They wish to see intervention on the part of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  They ask whether it is possible for the Irish troops stationed in Kosovo to perform a thorough search of the area.  I believe approximately 150 troops are stationed there in addition to a Garda unit.  They also ask whether the Garda in Ireland can question the Irish pilgrims who accompanied Winnie Brady on her pilgrimage as the local police in Medjugorje never bothered to speak to any of them to pick up any possible evidence, information or clues.  The family members want to pursue all avenues until they find out what happened to her.  After two months, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is probably their last hope and should help them.</p>

            <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
            <p eId="para_944">I thank Deputy Costello for sharing time.  The sisters of Winnie Brady also spoke to me and are absolutely distraught eight weeks after the disappearance and loss of their sister.  This is an appalling nightmare for them.  I ask either of the Ministers of State present in the Chamber, Deputies Conor Lenihan and Michael Ahern, to meet the sisters and other relatives of Winnie Brady to listen to their concerns at first hand.  The Ministers of State would be moved by how the relatives feel.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">They strongly believe the search in Medjugorje has been inadequate thus far and that more must be done.  They are fearful of a local cover-up designed to prevent a negative impact on tourism in that area.  As the Minister of State is aware, many thousands of Irish tourists travel to the region.  I join the call that the Army and Garda personnel already stationed in Bosnia might work with the local authorities to carry out a thorough search.  The relatives of Winnie strongly believe the search thus far has simply been inadequate and has not extended to the requisite areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">As Deputy Costello noted, there have also been rumours of other disappearances and of the presence of a serial killer in the area.  In his contacts with the local authorities in Medjugorje and Bosnia, has the Minister for Foreign Affairs established whether this is the case?  If so, it chimes with the views of some of the relatives that there may have been a local cover-up because of the consequential negative impact on tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">Above all, the sisters and relatives do not want this matter to be swept under the carpet.  They will not allow it to go away and intend to campaign until Winnie is found and the truth is established.  As local representatives, Deputy Costello and I insist that everything possible should be done to help the relatives in their search.  They require greater action, greater openness from the authorities here, to assure them the search is not over and that——</p>

            <p eId="para_950">Like both Deputies, I can only imagine the terrible nightmare being experienced by the family.  I assure both Deputies that everything possible will be done by my Department and any other relevant Department to seek an answer to the questions posed by the family.  At the outset, I wish to express my solidarity with the plight in which the family of the person mentioned by Deputy Costello find themselves.  As all Members will appreciate, this is a difficult and trying time for the family concerned, made all the more difficult by the fact that their loved one has gone missing far away from home.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">The Department of Foreign Affairs and the embassy in Slovenia, which is also accredited to Bosnia-Herzegovina, has provided active consular assistance and support to the family of the person in question.  In this regard, the embassy in Slovenia has been in ongoing contact with the relevant authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the local police force, rescue services, politicians and senior officials in the region in which the town of Medjugorje is situated.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">A diplomatic officer of the embassy travelled to the region to liaise with local police, relevant agencies and with officials involved in the search.  During the visit, the officer also had many meetings with members of the missing person's family.  Subsequently, the Irish ambassador travelled to Medjugorje and to the regional capital, Mostar, to review the search arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">Since the person's disappearance, there have been six largescale searches, some of which involved the use of a helicopter provided by the officer commanding the European Union police mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  In addition to these largescale searches, there have been more localised searches.  Searching continues and an officer from the Irish Embassy will again shortly visit Medjugorje to review the situation.  Members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces on EU service in Bosnia-Herzegovina have also participated actively and helpfully in the searches for the missing person.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">I assure the Deputies that since the person's disappearance, the consular division of the Department of Foreign Affairs has provided all possible consular assistance and support to her family.  In this regard, the husband of the missing person has expressed warm appreciation for all the assistance he has received from the Department and from the Irish Embassy in Slovenia.  I can also confirm that senior officials of the consular division recently met with other family members of the person.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">I assure the Deputies that the Department will continue to provide all possible consular assistance and support, including, as indicated above, a third visit at an early date by an officer of the embassy to Medjugorje to review the search operation.  I will personally convey the specific request made in the context of this debate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, with a view to setting up a meeting with all relevant individuals.</p>

          <speech by="#GayMitchell" eId="spk_373">
            <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_956">At a recent occupational health and safety summit, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Killeen, made a number of points.  Among them were that Ireland's workforce is set to experience rapid ageing from 2025 onwards and that increased rates of life expectancy for both men and women pose significant challenges for the work environment.  He argued that early or mandatory retirement also presents significant challenges for our future labour market.  He pointed out that in 2004 the Central Statistics Office projected that the population aged 65 years and over would increase by 538,000 from 2006 to 2031, an increase of 116%, with no corresponding increase in the younger working age population.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">The Minister of State argued that the cost of funding age-related payments in 2005 was in the order of €3 billion.  He argued that while this ageing was not taking place as quickly as in some of our European partners, there was no doubt that this would become a significant issue for Ireland in the longer term and that the NCB in 2006 predicted that by 2050 there would be less than two persons of working age per person over 65.  He argued that the cultural mindset change that is required by both employers and employees to encourage older workers to remain in the labour market is one which the national strategy on health and well-being at work would endeavour to encourage through promotion, prevention and rehabilitation and so enable them to avail of the education and employment opportunities as envisaged in the agreement.  He argued that, consequently, unlike our European partners, we have time and opportunity to address this through the strategy, which is designed to maintain and, where necessary, improve the work ability of the older workforce so they can work healthily to full retirement age and beyond full retirement age if they wish and retire healthily.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">This is what the Minister of State stated at this summit.  Interestingly, the European country in which men can expect the longest period of illness-free life after the age of 65 is Cyprus, which has an average of 12.6 years.  Cyprus is also the EU member state with one of the highest proportions of people aged between 65 and 69 in employment — 20% against an EU average of 8%.  I raise this issue in the context of a case involving a constituent who has worked for a FÁS scheme for the last six years, the last three of which he has worked as a supervisor under a jobs initiative in a parish hall.  This scheme is administered by a partnership board.  The man took retirement in 1994 as a result of an occupational accident and now takes home €296 out of €320 gross.  He signed a contract in June 2006 to continue for the year and has now been informed that he must retire the day before he turns 66.  He will be 66 years of age on 31 December 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">This man carries out an important function locally which is badly needed.  As I understand it and bearing in mind the comments made by the Minister of State which I have just cited, Government policy is to encourage those who reach the age of 66 to continue to be available for work if they so choose.  This is for a variety of reasons, including the issue of longevity to which I referred.  When is Government policy likely to become consistent with its stated aims?  For the sake of consistency of policy and, particularly in this case for the sake of the community, I ask the Minister to direct FÁS to change its policy so FÁS supervisors and workers can be retained after the age of 66 where they wish to continue and where the community wishes to retain them.  FÁS tells me this is a matter of policy and policy is made by the Government and the Dáil.  I ask the Minister to review and change this policy.  This man will be not be 66 for another two months and wishes to continue serving his community, which needs him.  He is not being paid a fortune but he is engaged in a very worthwhile job and is very badly needed.  I ask the Minister to change the policy and allow him to continue working.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_960">It is welcome to see Deputy Gay Mitchell back in the House.  He has not lost any of his energy.  I am delivering this reply on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, who has responsibility for community employment, CE, schemes.  CE schemes are active labour market programmes designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">CE as an active labour market programme has the emphasis on progression into employment.  This programme, with its focus on the needs of disadvantaged persons, forms a major response by FÁS to tackling the social exclusion of such groups as persons with disabilities, lone parents, long-term unemployed people and drug abusers, with a view to their reintegration into the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">Changes have been made to CE so that it responds to the needs of disadvantaged people.  CE health sector places have been ring-fenced from any reductions that have taken place since March 2002 and FÁS makes every effort to ensure places are maintained at the agreed level on ring-fenced schemes.  In addition, projects in RAPID areas are given priority.  However, it is important to remember that the primary purpose of CE is to provide short-term work experience and training opportunities for long-term unemployed persons and other disadvantaged groups with a view to facilitating their progression to work in the open labour market.  It is imperative, therefore, that CE positions be vacated on a rolling basis to facilitate new participants.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment raised the three-year participation limit to allow those aged 55 years and over to avail of a six-year period on CE schemes based on participation since 3 April 2000.  This was done in recognition of the fact that older participants may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">In July of this year, my Department published its sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005.  One of the key highlights of this plan is to increase participation rates of people with disabilities on CE over the period of the plan and to raise the CE participation limits for people with disabilities to provide additional training to assist progression to employment.  In the case of people with disabilities under 55 years of age, the participation limit was raised by one year from three to four years, while for people with disabilities over 55 years of age, the participation limit was also raised by one year from six to seven years.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">A new individual learner plan is also currently being rolled out nationally in FÁS which is designed to track and record an individual's progress from programme entry to exit.  Beginning with the identification of learning needs at induction, through to project and progression skills development, this new approach addresses the personal, social, vocational and specific work-related skills needs of each participant.</p>

            <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_967">Funding for CE in 2006 has been provided with a view to maintaining overall numbers on FÁS schemes at 2005 levels.  Currently, over 22,000 people are employed on CE schemes nationally, a figure which has been maintained throughout 2006.  FÁS is hopeful it will fill its full allocation in 2006.  In delivering these places, FÁS operates flexibility in the management of this allocation in order to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.  This provision of places is managed through a standardised application process between regional FÁS offices and local sponsor-community organisations and any issues regarding the allocation of places are dealt with in this context.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">CE still aims to remain an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration given to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, I will raise the case highlighted by Deputy Gay Mitchell with the Minister and ask him to review the situation pertaining to the individual in question.</p>

          <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_378">
            <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_970">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  There are six train stations in my constituency.  Kildare North would generally be regarded as being in the heart of the commuter belt and transport-related matters are a key issue because of the level of congestion both locally and to and from Dublin city centre and other parts of the city.  Part of the focus of Transport 21 is an attempt to shift people away from a high dependence on the private car and towards the use of public transport.  It is not just a question of providing additional trains, buses, stations and a wider variety of radial and orbital routes, it is about considering how commuters get from their hall doors to their destinations.  I can say with certainty that there is total chaos every day of the week at the stations in my constituency.  I expect the same is true of most other suburban stations.  Not only are cars parked at the stations but they are also in neighbouring housing estates, along footpaths and streets.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">It is difficult to conclude that there is anything other than a willingness by the public to use public transport but much more attention needs to be paid to ancillary services around public transport corridors.  For example, a greater use of feeder buses is one option that could be considered.  While the likelihood of such services making money is remote, if one balances the cost of congestion against the subsidy that would be paid there is a strong argument in favour of such services.  The same can be said about the provision of decent well lit footpaths and cycleways.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">As the capacity of public transport services increases, the absence of provision of such services around public transport corridors will get worse.  Irish Rail is now actively considering charging for parking at train stations.  I have heard a tariff of €4 per day mooted.  When one considers that a day return ticket can cost €3.60, this would more than double the daily travel cost for some commuters, thus making public transport a most unattractive option.  I am well aware that it can be expensive to provide and maintain car parking facilities to a high standard but if one empties the car parks, most cars will converge onto the N4, the N7, the M50 etc.  When one considers the issues of inefficiency, congestion both in terms of the cost to individuals and the economy, carbon emissions and the cost of carbon trading and increased accident rates, it is a small cost in the overall context of the provision of public transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">Maynooth station car park is full before 8 a.m.  Many commuters drive from Enfield to Maynooth to get the train.  Neighbouring housing estates are filled with commuters' cars and all the on-street parking spaces in the village are taken up, thus leaving no space for shoppers.  This puts pressure on the local authority for the provision of off-street parking, which is expensive.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">Hazelhatch station, which serves Celbridge, is a mile from the town centre so there is no question of people walking to it.  Cars park on the path and cycleway for up to 100 yd. beyond the train station which has a fairly big car park.  Sallins station, which serves Naas, is also a distance from the town.  I am trying to paint a picture for the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, of what conditions are like at those three stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">It is intended to charge for parking at the new car park provided at Leixlip Louisa Bridge station.  This will make it unattractive for commuters.  When cars are parked in neighbouring housing estates it makes it difficult for bins to be collected, people cannot get deliveries and there is a problem with access for emergency vehicles.  There is a need to address this serious problem in the overall context of the provision of additional public transport.  People are willing to use public transport but it must be considered how people get from their homes to their destinations.  I can well understand imposing charges for parking in the city centre as a disincentive to the use of cars but I cannot understand why it would be considered on the outskirts.  I believe it will be counterproductive.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_976">I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to respond.  The provision of facilities at train stations to enhance physical access to services and increase usage is integral to investments already made in the rail network under the national development plan and planned or under way under Transport 21.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, substantial Exchequer funding has been provided for improvements at stations throughout the network.  Such improvements include upgrade works on stations and access to stations, platforms, lighting, signage, car parks, etc.  In addition, Iarnród Éireann seeks to facilitate and develop feeder bus services to maximise use of train services.  For example, feeder bus services are operated jointly with Dublin Bus at Sutton, Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire and Connolly Station, for Heuston Station.  Where new stations are being built, for example as part of the Cork commuter services project and the Kildare route project, a high standard of customer facilities is specified in the design, including for extensive car parking facilities and for pedestrian and cyclist access.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">Access and services are further enhanced through the requirement that all investments in both new and existing facilities comply with the Department's sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005.  This plan establishes a framework for a high standard for access generally to public transport services, and was developed in consultation with disability and other user groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">Park and ride facilities are an important component in encouraging people to transfer from private cars and onto public transport.  I have therefore made funding available under Transport 21 for the capital costs of developing park and ride facilities.  Iarnród Éireann has park and ride facilities at the majority of the 134 railway stations throughout its network.  These vary from small on-street facilities to large pay facilities at major stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">In the greater Dublin area, GDA, Iarnród Éireann has over 30 car parks, each with more than 20 car spaces.  The largest of these are at Greystones, Coolmine, Kildare and Newbridge.  In addition, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council operates a pay car park at Salthill station.  Both Connolly and Heuston Stations have dedicated pay car parks for intercity service users.  There is a pay parking facility at Cork station and Galway station has a limited number of spaces for public use.  There is also car parking at Waterford.  Iarnród Éireann plans to expand the parking facilities at Cork and Galway stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">Iarnród Éireann has been extending car parking facilities at all locations where it has land available.  In recent years this has included Portmarnock, Newbridge, Killester, Clontarf Road and Skerries.  Iarnród Éireann is currently undertaking car parking extensions at Mallow, Ennis, and Leixlip Louisa Bridge.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">My Department is also funding, as part of Transport 21, a study by Irish Rail into the prioritisation of car park initiatives across the rail network, with a view to developing a strategic, programmed approach to the provision of car park facilities in the future.  In the meantime, all new station developments on commuter networks in the GDA and the rest of the country are designed to include car park facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">The issue of pay parking at train stations is an operational matter for Iarnród Éireann in the first instance having regard to the costs and revenues involved, traffic management requirements and the need to ensure the viability of rail routes.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
         if her attention has been drawn to the recent OECD Report which found that child care costs here are among the highest in Europe and are rising far faster than inflation; the steps she will take to ensure affordable child care for parents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_380">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_985">I welcome the OECD's recent report on Early Childhood Education and Care "Starting Strong II".</p>
            <p eId="para_986">I believe the Report's findings show a strong convergence between OECD and Irish Government policy for Early Childhood Education and Care.  The OECD notes that policy in this area should not be elaborated from outside but should be based on consensus-building within the country as each OECD member will have individual factors and levels of historical development which will require tailored solutions to be found.  Secondly brief reference is made in the report to some of the major recent initiatives taken by Ireland in the area of Early Childhood Education and Care.  The data and the findings of the Report largely reflect the position during 2002-2004 which have been substantially advanced by these more recent developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">The report finds that, along with Italy and Portugal, Ireland was found to be spending 0.44% of its GDP on this area.  If our level of investment is measured as a percentage of Gross National Product (GNP), the figure rises to 0.54% which is on a par with Germany and Austria.  Parents will receive more support in paying their childcare costs in 2006 following the increases in April this year in Child Benefit and the introduction of the Early Childhood Supplement of €1,000 per annum to parents of children aged up to 6 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">The Irish model has taken the classic features of state supported "supply-side" systems, such as wage supports for community childcare services, providing supports for services through the 33 local City and County Childcare Committees, supporting national voluntary childcare organisations and targeting identified local childcare service needs.  Our investment is also based on social inclusion which is also relevant to our increasingly diverse society.  These are all key values identified by the OECD.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">These Programmes are, in turn, key elements of the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010.  I am satisfied that the Government approach to childcare will serve to moderate prices in the sector over time by increasing the supply of places and giving parents greater choice. As I have outlined, the Government approach is also about improving quality as childcare should not be judged solely on matters of cost and availability.</p>

            <p eId="para_991">The HSE has advised my Department that the decision to transfer an individual patient from one hospital to another is a matter for the attending clinician and his or her team.  Patient safety is the overriding factor in any inter-hospital transfer.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">There is no national protocol governing inter-hospital patient transfers.  Any such protocol could only outline general principles and would have to be developed further at local level taking account of regional and local considerations.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">A number of HSE hospital networks have developed protocols for specific circumstances such as the transfer of seriously injured trauma patients to specific units and how to deal with situations in which a woman in advanced labour presents to a hospital without an obstetric unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">The hospital network in the north-east has done considerable work in relation to this issue and has prepared a very detailed document.  This highlights the need, in drawing up protocols, to take account of the services available locally in a hospital and those available regionally within a hospital network.  This document is being circulated to all hospital networks and I have asked the HSE to ensure that all networks review their existing protocols in the light of this document and develop new ones as appropriate.</p>

In the past, health board employees would have been covered by the Local Government Superannuation Scheme while other health sector employees, in voluntary hospitals for example, would have been covered by the Voluntary Hospitals Superannuation Scheme or the Nominated Health Agencies Superannuation Scheme.

            <p eId="para_1012">I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 183 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">The Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System, published in 2003, found that the arrangements in place at the time were complex and fragmented.  It identified the need for fundamental system-wide structural reform to move from fragmentation to consolidation and integration. This detailed analysis was accepted by the Government, and the HSE was established in January 2005 pursuant to the Health Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">The provisions of the Act which established the HSE also took cognisance of the need to provide for public representation and user participation. These included the establishment of Regional Health Forums and the National Health Consultative Forum referred to in the Question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">The National Health Consultative Forum, which has the function to advise the Minister on matters relating to the provision of health and personal social services, represents a continuation of a similar arrangement initiated on a non-statutory basis under the National Health Strategy.  Annual meetings took place from 2002 to 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">As I have indicated, the Regional Health Forums were envisaged as part of the arrangements for the establishment of the HSE. I made regulations under the 2004 Act to allow for their establishment on 1st January 2006.  To date each of the four Regional Forums established has met on a number of occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">The HSE, as a new and large public organisation, is investing considerable effort in developing its links with Oireachtas members. The recent commencement of meetings by the HSE's senior managers at Administrative Area level with Oireachtas members is part of an ongoing development of its channels of communication in that regard.  It is a development I welcome.  These arrangements are, of course, additional to the very specific provisions relating to the Executive's accountability to the Oireachtas at national level which are contained in the 2004 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">As we proceed with the consolidation of services under a single statutory body, the HSE, rather than a multiplicity of different bodies, I remain convinced of the importance and correctness of the reform path being taken.</p>

            <p eId="para_1036">The HSE has advised me that restrictions were introduced on consultant surgeons in Cavan and Monaghan performing major Gastro-Intestinal surgery in 2003 following the suspension of two consultants. Consultants are no longer precluded from carrying out major GI surgery in Cavan.  These restrictions reflected concerns regarding the then heavy reliance on locum consultants at both sites, and concerns about surgical outcomes in Cavan which led to a number of external reviews of patient treatments being commissioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">In November 2005 a series of recommendations concerning surgical services in Cavan/Monaghan were announced by the National Hospitals Office (NHO) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. These recommendations were developed following the 2004 RCSI report on surgical services at Cavan General Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">The implementation of the RCSI's recommendations saw the promotion of team working among the consultants, the promotion of interdisciplinary audit, equity of access to resources for all consultants, and the co-ordination of activity between the two hospitals.</p>

            <p eId="para_1041">As part of the reform of the health service a National Ambulance Office has been established within the Health Service Executive (HSE). It has responsibility for the provision of pre-hospital emergency care nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">The most significant development in the sector for many years is the roll-out of the Advanced Paramedic Training Programme.  The introduction of the programme required two legislative changes which were completed in August 2005.

            <p eId="para_1047">Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in men. There are approximately 1,150 new invasive prostate cancer cases annually. It is predominantly a disease experienced by older men with the majority of cases occurring in the 70–74 year age group and the majority of deaths in the 80–84 year age group. The Department of Health and Children published a National Strategy for Cancer Control in June 2006. This National Strategy was developed by the National Cancer Forum which is chaired by Professor Paul Redmond, Head of Surgery, University College Cork and Cork University Hospital. The Forum is multidisciplinary and representative of all levels of service, both community and hospital based, and of the Health Service Executive. It also has consumer representation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">As part of its work on the Strategy, the Forum reviewed all issues relating to cancer control including specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. It highlighted that cancer control requires a whole population, integrated and cohesive approach that involves prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and supportive and palliative care. It places a major emphasis on measurement of need and on addressing inequalities. The Forum did not call for a specific awareness campaign on the issue of prostate cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">The Forum concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population based prostate screening programme in this country but said that this issue should be reassessed when results are available from randomised control trials currently being conducted internationally. This position is consistent with the Recommendations adopted by the European Union which advocate the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for healthcare resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">We are very supportive of the Irish Cancer Society's campaign entitled "Action Prostate Cancer" which was launched in April of this year by the Minister for Health and Children. Its aim is to become the leading provider of prostate cancer information and support in Ireland.  Appropriate treatment for men diagnosed with prostate cancer is available at major hospitals throughout the country.  Any man who has concerns in relation to prostate cancer should contact his GP who will, where appropriate, refer him to the appropriate services in his area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1052">New hospitals are being developed in Dublin under a variety of initiatives.  The Government has mandated the Health Service Executive to move forward with the development of a new national tertiary paediatric hospital on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.  A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group has been established for this purpose.  Among the key items to be addressed are the definition of a high level framework brief for the new hospital, the transfer of the site from the Mater Hospital and the establishment of a Development Board for the new hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">The Government also noted that the joint HSE/Department of Health and Children task group recommended that the HSE undertake a review of the configuration of both adult acute services and maternity services in Dublin.</p>

This initiative will free up additional beds for public patients at these hospitals by transferring private activity to the new private hospitals.  There has been a lot of interest in this initiative.  The HSE has pre-qualified a number of bidders in respect of each site and is now in the process of evaluating outline proposals and shortlisting bidders.</p>

Subject to the Cabinet's approval, I hope to publish the Bill and present it to the Oireachtas before the end of the current session of the Oireachtas.</p>

The prudent use of antibiotics underpins any approach to the control of antibiotic resistant bacteria, including MRSA.  This, together with good professional practice and routine infection control precautions, such as hand hygiene, constitute the major measures in controlling and preventing healthcare-associated infection, including that caused by MRSA, both in hospital and in community health care units.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1115">I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 126 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">I take it both questions relate to a possible human flu pandemic. For the sake of clarity, avian flu (H5N1) is primarily a disease of birds. To date, there have been a very small number of human cases of H5N1 infection in situations where there has been very close contact with infected birds. There is no evidence of efficient human to human transmission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1117">I would like to draw a very clear distinction between avian flu and the possibility of a future human flu pandemic. Experts advise that such a pandemic may arise as a result of the current H5N1 avian flu situation, but this is by no means inevitable. Nevertheless, the pandemic threat is real: while neither the timing nor the severity of the next pandemic can be predicted, experts advise it is a matter of when it arrives not if.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118">A global flu pandemic will affect all countries and will cause widespread disease and death, and massive disruption to the health services and to society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">Improving our preparedness to manage a flu pandemic is therefore a high priority for my Department and for the Health Service Executive. A high level pandemic flu plan will be published in December 2006 based on the framework recommended by the World Health Organisation for national pandemic plans and reflecting up to date advice from the Influenza Pandemic Expert Group. The plan will focus on the health response, but will also provide the basis for the contingency planning which must take place across all sectors of society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">It is not possible to predict the impact of the next pandemic: much will depend on the characteristics of the virus, such as the clinical attack rate, the severity of the illness and the resulting case fatality rate. These cannot be known until the pandemic virus emerges. However, in order to assist planning, a number of scientific models of the impact of a pandemic have been developed internationally. In Ireland an empirical model of pandemic influenza has been proposed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and adopted for planning purposes. This model can be used to estimate the number of clinical cases, hospitalisations and deaths that will occur in Ireland during each week of a 15-week single wave pandemic, in the absence of any interventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">The planning assumptions are:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1122">a 25% clinical attack rate resulting in almost 980,000 clinical cases in the course of a pandemic hospitalisation rate between 0.55% and 2.4%, with a minimum total of 5,400 influenza-related hospitalisations over the 15 weeks peaking  at 1,100 during week 6; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1123">a minimum total of 3,600 influenza-related deaths over the 15 weeks with a peak of 780 during week 6.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">These assumptions are being kept under review and may be revised in line with international advice and  risk assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">The following list gives an indication of ongoing preparedness activities:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1126">the Influenza Pandemic Expert Group is updating expert guidance for publication in December;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1127">the Pandemic Influenza Operational Response Plan is being updated in line with the most up to date expert advice;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1128">a Standing Inter-Departmental Committee has been established to consider issues which go beyond the health aspects of an influenza pandemic;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1129">arrangements have been made to procure a stockpile of the human H5N1 vaccine for key health care workers and other essential workers —  my Department is also actively pursuing an advanced purchase order for a pandemic strain vaccine;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1130">we have stockpiled 1 million treatment packs of the antiviral drug, Tamiflu, and a supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (oseltamivir phosphate powder) to treat children aged between 1 to 5 years of age;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1131">on foot of expert advice, we are now stockpiling additional supplies of the other suitable antiviral drug, Relenza; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1132">the Expert Group is updating guidance on the non-pharmaceutical public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread of infection with reference to the latest recommendations from the World Health Organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the progress made over the past year in preparing for a possible flu pandemic and this work will continue to be a top priority for my Department and for the HSE in the coming year.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_1139">As the Deputy may be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993  provide for the payment of subvention for private nursing home care for applicants who qualify on both medical and means grounds.  General rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for nursing home subvention are set out in the Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993, as amended by the 2005 Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">There are currently three rates of subvention payable, i.e. €114.30, €152.40 and €190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum and these rates apply in all parts of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted.  The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 2004.  The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. The supports paid by the HSE vary from person to person and region to region, depending on nursing home fees for example.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">Additional funding of €20 million was provided for the administration of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme in 2006. The additional €20 million is to support more basic nursing home subventions and reduce waiting lists for enhanced subventions: it is also to bring more consistency to subventions support throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">The Health (Nursing Homes)(Amendment) Bill 2006 is designed to ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing home care is grounded in primary legislation and to help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis across the country. In addition, national guidelines on nursing home subvention are currently being developed by the HSE to ensure an even and equitable application of the regulations nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">The Government is currently considering new policy on Long Term Care and several principles underlying this were agreed with the social partners in "Towards 2016". These principles include, for example, that there should be one standardised national needs assessment for older people needing care.  The use of community and home-based care should be maximised.  Sheltered housing options will be encouraged.  Where residential care is required, it should be quality care and there should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  The level of support for residential care should be indifferent as to whether that care is in a public or private facility. The financial model to support any new arrangements must also be financially sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">The Department is currently drawing up proposals as agreed with the social partners in "Towards 2016".</p>

In response to this, my Department entered into negotiations with the broadcasting, media and drinks industries while at the same time pursuing the development of legislation to restrict alcohol advertising, sponsorship and sales promotions/marketing practices. It was agreed that the industry would respond on an incremental basis. This has resulted in the establishment of Central Copy Clearance Ireland which addresses the issue of the content of advertisements, the development of a Voluntary Code of Practice on Advertising which addresses the issue of placement and the establishment of the Alcohol Marketing and Communications Monitoring Body to oversee the implementation of the Voluntary Code. As the Minister for Health and Children has previously indicated, she will await the Annual Report of the Monitoring Body before deciding on future actions in relation to legislation on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1151">The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 came into effect on 30 June 2006.  The repayment scheme was launched publicly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald on 14 August 2006.  A national advertising campaign and a helpline also commenced on this date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">The HSE have informed the Department that over 126,000 forms have been dispatched to members of the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1153">The Scheme Administrator has commenced scanning the records of long stay facilities around the country and to date more than 50 locations have been visited for this purpose.  These records will form the basis for the calculation of the majority of the repayments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154">The HSE have informed the Department that over 17,000 forms have been submitted to the scheme administrator applying for repayments and these applications are being processed at present. The timeframe for payment is predicated primarily on whether the applicant is alive or whether the application is being made by a family member or the estate of a deceased person.  Priority is being given to pay those who are still alive. It is estimated that there are now in the region of 15,000 people within this category.  Living people who were wrongly charged will be first to receive payments under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">The HSE has advised that the first offers of repayment are commencing this week and that the first payments are expected to issue before the end of November with further payments continuing thereafter in subsequent weeks. It is expected that the bulk of payments to estates will commence in the Spring of 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_1166">I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 136 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">One of the key measures of health status is premature mortality, major causes of premature mortality in Ireland being circulatory diseases, cancer, accidents and injuries. For all of these, there is a social class gradient, with those in the lowest socio-economic group being the worst off. Likewise, at the beginning of life, health status indicators such as infant mortality and low birth weight highlight the adverse situation of the lowest socio-economic group. In addition, it is known that some groups such as Travellers have lower life expectancy than the general population. Smaller scale studies also show higher levels of ill health among homeless people, drug users and prisoners. Mental illness is also a significant cause of morbidity, with the burden again falling most heavily on the lowest socio-economic group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">The health sector is strongly committed to implementing a range of measures aimed at tackling and reducing these health inequalities. Social inclusion-relevant aspects of existing health strategies and plans feature in the current National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion (NAP inclusion) 2003-2005, in the recently negotiated social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and in Ireland's National Report on Strategies for Social Protection and Social Inclusion (NSSPI) 2006-2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">The National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS) is the main vehicle through which the Government's response to the problems of poverty and social exclusion is being channelled. The Government's 2002 review of the NAPS Building an Inclusive Society sets out a number of targets aimed at reducing health inequalities. These include targets to reduce the gap in premature mortality between the lowest and highest socio-economic groups for circulatory diseases, for cancers and for injuries and poisoning; to reduce the gap in low birth weight rates between children from the lowest and highest socio-economic groups; and to reduce the gap in life expectancy between the Traveller Community and the whole population. My Department is currently working to develop an appropriate set of shorter-term targets that will reflect progress towards these longer-term outcomes. It is anticipated that this work will feed into the 2007 HSE Service Plan and the forthcoming NAP inclusion 2006-2008 process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">In June this year I launched the Cancer Control Strategy 2006 prepared by the National Cancer Forum. The Strategy recognises that there is a need for a consistent focus on risk factors for cancer, incidence of cancer, access to services, and outcome from services to help to reduce health inequalities between various groups. The Strategy recommends that the HSE should put in place arrangements to monitor inequalities in cancer risks, cancer occurrence, cancer services and cancer outcomes. The policy indicators proposed in the Strategy will provide an important means of maintaining a policy focus on cancer inequalities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1178">I have asked my Department to arrange to provide the Deputy with information on the estimated cost of providing medical cards to all children aged under six years. However an exercise to establish the estimated cost will first need to be undertaken, with the assistance of the Health Service Executive, and the information sought will be provided to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">In relation to the Deputy's request for an estimate of the cost of providing medical cards to persons aged under 18 years who do not currently hold a medical card, it is estimated this would cost approximately an additional €300 million per annum.  This estimate has been calculated on the basis of the Central Statistics Office's national population by age estimates for 2004 and information from the Health Service Executive on the number of medical card holders aged under 18 years, as at 1st September 2006.  Cost data from a number of sources has been used, in particular from the latest available 2004 Annual Report of the former General Medical Services (Payments) Board and figures provided by the HSE regarding General Medical Services (GMS) GP capitation fee payments as of 31st December 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">It will be noted that should eligibility arrangements be adjusted to enable larger numbers to qualify for a medical card, the actual costs arising would depend on the precise demographic profile of those additional clients.  The capitation payments to GPs, for example, are calculated according to clients' age, sex and distance of their residence from the GP's centre of practice.  Furthermore, the effect on the GMS drugs budget and on certain other services available free of charge to medical card holders cannot be predicted with accuracy and would be dependent on the health status of the clients concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">The following matters were not taken into account in arriving at the estimate of approximately €300 million:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1182">potential additional costs in terms of income forgone by public hospitals in respect of A &amp; E attendance and in-patient charges;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1183">the possible cost, depending on the circumstances of the additional persons obtaining medical cards, of such services as aids and appliances and public health nursing;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1184">any offsetting effect of a potential reduction in costs under the Drug Payments Scheme, non-medical card holders are entitled to make claims under the Drugs Payments Scheme (DPS) for reimbursement of all prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of €85 per calendar month, and persons obtaining a medical card and who currently qualify under this scheme would no longer come within the terms of the scheme, as their drug costs would be met under the GMS; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1185">costs in other areas of Government in which the holding of a medical card may be used as a means of determining entitlement to services or benefits.</p>

            <p eId="para_1190">The organisation of specialist paediatric and neonatal surgical services has been the subject of extensive debate for a number of years.

While there is a level of shared consultant posts, the three departments operate separately.  My Department is advised by the Health Service Executive that its view is that there is now a unique opportunity to develop a single, unified department of paediatric surgery in Dublin to facilitate integration and further collaboration among the three children's hospitals in advance of the move to a new national paediatric hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192">The HSE has been in discussions with the three children's hospitals regarding paediatric services in general and paediatric specialist surgery in particular.

            <p eId="para_1194">My Department, in partnership with the National Disability Authority (NDA), has developed draft National Standards for Disability Services (NSDS) in consultation with people with disabilities, their families, carers, service providers, health services providers and other stakeholders.  These standards are designed to ensure that services are provided to an agreed level of quality and that the level of quality is consistent on a national basis.

            <p eId="para_1195">The draft NSDS are being considered within the framework of the Health Services Reform Programme. A critical element in this process is the establishment of the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA).  The new Health Bill currently being drafted to underpin the Health Reform Programme will include provision for the establishment of HIQA on a statutory basis.  The establishment of HIQA as a key part of the architecture of planning and developing health and personal social services in Ireland will promote a continuous quality improvement ethos in the health system.  The development and implementation of the NSDS is a central element of the process.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1198">As the Deputy may be aware in 2002, the then Minister for Education and Science introduced the Residential Institutions Redress Act.  This legislation was enacted to provide a mechanism for former residents of industrial schools, reformatories, orphanages, children's homes and in certain situations special schools and hospitals to obtain redress for injuries they suffered while so resident.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">The rationale behind the setting up of the Redress Board was that children in the residential institutions were separated from their parents and, therefore, did not have the benefit of the care and protection which a child in the care of a family usually enjoys. The institutions concerned controlled all aspects of the children's lives 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with no reasonable capacity for access to or involvement by their parents. Therefore, the children in the institutions relied to a significant degree on the public bodies that had a statutory duty to protect them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">During the passage of the legislation through both Houses the issue of including children who were in foster care was discussed and it was decided not to extend the legislation, as children in foster care were not in a residential institution.  It is not the intention currently to establish a redress board dealing with foster care.  However, I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that children placed in foster care receive the highest standard of care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">I am aware of correspondence from 3 individuals in recent times seeking the establishment of such a redress board and I have responded to these individuals in this regard.  It is, of course, open to any individual to pursue their own redress through the courts system should they wish.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_1224">The inspection of private nursing homes is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  The 1990 Act provides for the registration of private nursing homes and procedures for attaching conditions to the registration and for de-registering homes.  The Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations, 1993 set out the standards which private nursing homes owners must adhere to in the provision of nursing home services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">In accordance with the Regulations, the HSE carries out inspections of private nursing homes. The HSE has inspection teams in each area. Each team is comprised of a Senior Area Medical Officer (Chairperson), a Director or Assistant Director of Public Health Nursing and a Principal or Senior Environmental Health Officer. Where Environmental Health Officers visit initially, a medical and nursing inspection is carried out soon afterwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1226">Each nursing home receives an integrated report following inspection, which contains recommendations in relation to best practice/conditions, which are required for continued registration. Under the 1990 Nursing Homes Act and the 1993 Regulations, Health Service Executive areas can attach particular conditions to registration. Any deviation from these conditions can be subject to sanction up to and including legal action in the District and Higher Courts. The inspection team liaises with the proprietor to ensure compliance with the Regulations within an agreed timescale.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">Two inspections per year of every nursing home are required in accordance with Article 24 of the Regulations. In addition the inspection teams carry out follow-up inspections as required and also conduct advice visits for prospective nursing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">The HSE has informed my Department that they commenced publishing nursing home inspection reports on their website: <i>www.hse.ie</i> in September 2006. The plan to publish nursing home inspection reports follows considerable consultation within the HSE and also with representatives of nursing homes organisations. It should be noted that the reports being published on the website will give a snapshot of the situation in a particular nursing home on the date of inspection. Information of a confidential nature will not be published.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">In addition, a Working Group was established by the Department to develop the standards for residential care settings for older people. Membership of the Group comprised officials from the Department, the Health Service Executive, the Social Services Inspectorate and the Irish Health Service Accreditation Board. The Group was involved in developing draft standards for the inspection of both public and private residential care for older people.  These draft standards will be circulated to interested parties for consultation shortly. In addition, the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board has examined the development of accreditation standards for both public and private residential care for older people. These will be introduced once national standards are established. The IHSAB and the DoHC are in ongoing consultation in relation to national and accreditation standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_1232">I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 330 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">The expertise and professional commitment of the staff at St. Luke's Hospital will continue to be an essential element in the development of cancer care.  The decision to transfer this resource was taken by the Government in the context of its consideration of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology Services.  The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology, one element of cancer care, is integrated with all other aspects of care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  The Board of St. Luke's Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government's decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology.  A transfer on similar lines took place earlier this year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a major academic teaching hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">In progressing the transfer, I will build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke's.  I have ensured that experts at St. Luke's are centrally involved in the planning and delivery of the National Plan.  The plan consists of large centres in Dublin (at Beaumont and St. James's Hospitals), Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  Medical and scientific experts from the hospital are involved in developing the output specifications for the delivery of new radiation oncology services nationally.  The Chief Executive at St. Luke's will lead the management team of the new facility at St. James's.  I also appointed the Chairman of St. Luke's to chair a National Radiation Oncology Oversight Group to advise me on progress on the implementation of the plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">I have approved the provision of two additional linear accelerators at St. Luke's to provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the national plan.  I expect these services to commence late next year.  Last week I also announced the approval of two radiation oncology facilities at Beaumont and St. James's Hospitals, comprising of two linear accelerators and associated treatment planning at each site, to be delivered in early 2009.  These are key elements of the delivery of the National Plan.</p>

         the most recent position of chiropody services for medical card holders; if she will clarify the possibility of chiropodist charging top-up fees to medical card holders; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1237">There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements are made to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.  My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service. This process has been underway for some time and considerable progress has been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made; and provide for an appeals framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_1243">The Taoiseach, the Chief Executive Officer of the Health Service Executive and I met with representatives of the Adelaide Hospital Society on 28 June 2006 to discuss a number of issues relating to the Adelaide and Meath Hospital incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght. The delegation included the Most Rev R.H.A. Eames, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, the Very Rev Dr David Clarke, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland and Rev Desmond Bain, former President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, together with the Archbishop of Dublin, The Most Rev Dr John W Neill, President of the Hospital.  They expressed concern at the implications for the National Children's Hospital of the Government decision to endorse the development of a single national tertiary paediatric hospital on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">A number of other matters relating to the provision of hospital services at Tallaght were also discussed.  In this context the delegation submitted a document proposing a wide range of service developments at the hospital over the next 10 years.  The proposals have been forwarded to the Health Service Executive for consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">In a letter to Archbishop Eames following the meeting, the Taoiseach gave an assurance that the Government wishes the hospital to thrive on a sustainable basis as a particular focal point for the involvement of the minority tradition in the healthcare system and as a key health provider to an expanding local population. These objectives will be pursued in tandem with other compelling objectives, including the achievement of an effective and efficient hospital care system, which will deliver the highest possible standards of care within a framework designed to respond to the needs of patients at national, regional and local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">Arising from the meeting, it has also been decided that a review will be conducted of decisions taken with regard to the funding and development of the hospital.  The arrangements for the review are being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">In relation to the development of the new National Paediatric Hospital, a joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group has been established to advance the matter.  Among the key items to be addressed are the definition of high level framework brief for the new hospital and the determination of the range of services and location of the urgent care centres required to support the new hospital.  The Transition Group will have consultations with relevant stakeholders, which will include representatives of the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">To date, no decision has been taken in relation to the range of services to be provided at the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght in the context of the development of the national paediatric hospital and the associated urgent care centres.</p>

            <p eId="para_1254">I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 178 and 194 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">Tackling the problems in A &amp; E departments is the Government's top priority in health.  Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A &amp; E and do not require admission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">A &amp; E services are improving around the country.  The Health Service activity reports over recent months indicate a significant reduction in the average number of patients in A &amp; E departments awaiting admission.  Waiting times for patients have also been reduced.  The percentage of people waiting longer than 24 hours for admission has decreased from 13% in May to 7% in September.  The long-term objective is to ensure that no patient waits longer than six hours to be admitted after the clinical decision to admit has been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">I understand that the HSE intends to begin collecting data on the turnaround time for those who are treated in A &amp; E departments without recourse to an acute hospital bed.  In the meantime, the Executive will carry out occasional surveys to give an indication of the length of time such patients wait in A &amp; E.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">In order to ensure that the improvements that have been achieved in recent months can be sustained, particularly during the winter months, the HSE has introduced a broad-based Winter Initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">The Winter Initiative will be similar to those in place in other health systems internationally.  Its purpose is to ensure that the services required to address the particular demands of the winter season are in place and operating optimally. It will encompass not just hospital services but also primary and community care services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The Initiative will build on work already underway and focus on a range of measures including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1261">preventative measures;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1262">public communications;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1265">NHO/PCCC service integration (Ambulance/Primary Care/A&amp;E links, Discharge Initiatives, Continuing Care and Home Supports);</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1266">planned escalation procedures to enable responsiveness to increased demand beyond normal operating levels; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1267">ongoing development of necessary infrastructure particularly for continuing care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">A formal structure is now in place, with eight Local Implementation Teams covering the whole country.  A comprehensive work programme has been presented to each team for implementation.  The teams will be responsible for ensuring that the Initiative's priorities are implemented at local level, as well as devising and implementing local solutions to address specific local winter demands.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">I believe that the actions and initiatives being taken by the HSE will result in the sustained improvements in A &amp; E services that patients and their families deserve.</p>

            <p eId="para_1282">The Deputy will be aware that significant funding has been made available to the HSE in the 2006 Budget in respect of home care packages — €30m. for 2006 and a further €25m. for 2007, giving a full year cost of €55m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">The aim of Home Care Packages is to enable older people to remain at home who would otherwise be cared for in a residential setting. A home care package consists of a range of services including Home Help, Public Health Nursing, Registered General Nursing, Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy.  In the first instance the use of mainstream community services will be maximised to maintain the older person at home.  If further services are assessed as being required, these will be provided through the home care package.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">The Home Care Packages are designed to:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1285">Facilitate timely discharge of older people from Acute Hospitals;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1286">Reduce inappropriate admissions;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1287">Reduce the need for older people to attend A&amp;E departments; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1288">Support older people to continue to live in their own community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">The HSE has advised that the decision to allocate a Home Care Package is based on the assessment of needs of the individual and the identification of any assessed needs which are not being met by mainstream services together with consideration of the appropriateness of care in the community in the individual case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">Guidelines are being drawn up in conjunction with the HSE for the standardised implementation of all aspects of Home Care Packages across the HSE.  In the meantime each area is continuing to roll out home care packages in accordance with the HSE service plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The HSE has further advised that the Dublin Mid Leinster Area has recently advertised requesting applications from tenderers for inclusion on a panel of preferred providers for home care services. Successful tenderers will be used to provide services over and above that which is possible to provide by the HSE inhouse. The tender specifies stringent standards that will have to be met on an ongoing basis for continued inclusion on the panel. It is envisaged that details of this panel will be available to members of the public who can then be assured that where they contract with a provider for services those services will be of a high standard that is monitored.</p>

            <p eId="para_1308">I do not believe there is anything to be gained from the establishment of a Statutory Inquiry into the issue of organ retention.  The report of an Inquiry into post mortem practice and organ retention chaired by Ms Anne Dunne SC was presented to me in March 2005.  Unfortunately it could not be published for legal reasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">Dr. Deirdre Madden, a distinguished expert on medical law, was appointed by Government in May 2005 to provide a report on key issues relating to post mortem practice and procedures.  She had access to all of the documentation assembled by the previous Inquiry. Her report on Post Mortem Practice and Procedures was published on 18 January this year.  Among her key findings are that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1310">Post-mortem examinations were carried out according to best professional and international standards and no intentional disrespect was shown to deceased children or their families.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1311">Communication between hospital staff and parents and next of kin was poor, with people not being told that organs might be retained at a post-mortem.  This was often done for paternalistic reasons, where doctors did not wish to upset next of kin when they were already distressed and vulnerable.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1312">There was no legislative framework in place and no consistent national policy relating to these practices.  However, the lack of a national policy on post mortem practice until 2002 is not unique to Ireland, nor was it the usual practice in other countries to provide information about organ retention to relatives of a deceased person.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1313">The system of disposal of organs and tissues by hospitals was not intentionally disrespectful to children or their families.  Hospitals were constrained by health and safety regulations and were obliged to consider organs and tissues as clinical waste.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1314">Between 1976 and 1988, almost 14,000 pituitary glands were collected in hospitals and supplied to two pharmaceutical companies for the manufacture of human growth hormone.  (Around 10% were collected from children, with the balance from adults). The practice ceased when a synthetic product was developed.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1315">The motivation for collection of glands was "for a positive medical and public benefit, notwithstanding the lack of specific consent for retention and use of the glands".</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1316">Hospitals were paid modest amounts for the additional work undertaken to remove the pituitary glands. There was no known commercial motive on the part of any hospital or its staff in the supply of glands to the companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">A key recommendation of the report was that a Working Group be established to examine issues not included in the original terms of reference, that is post mortem issues relating to babies who died before or during birth, minors and adults. This Group, chaired by Dr. Madden, was set up in March, 2006 and its membership includes representatives of Parents For Justice. I expect to receive a report from this Group shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318">Dr. Madden's first report on paediatric hospitals is a comprehensive and robust one and I expect that her Working Group report dealing with post mortem practice and procedures in other areas will be equally so.  She has set out key recommendations which are now being implemented by the Health Service Executive and other relevant agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1322">The 2002 Census data was used and the SAHRU (Small Area Health Research Unit) Deprivation Index was employed to pinpoint areas of deprivation in recognition of the close correlation between social deprivation &amp; mental illness.   As the Mental Health Act, 2001 places a particular emphasis on the role of the Consultant Psychiatrist, the availability of Consultants was an important driver in decision making in 2006.  Consultants were taken as a proxy for teams.   It is recognised by the HSE that many teams are incomplete at this time and work to address this is the focus of further analysis following the Census 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">The HSE's "Vision for Change" Implementation Group has identified the need for a comprehensive exercise to analyse concerns regarding funding inequity and resource availability nationally and intends to include this exercise in its workplan for 2007, building on the work already in train.</p>

            <p eId="para_1330">Clostridium difficile is not a notifiable disease and as a result it is difficult to quantify the extent of infection in the heath care system. However, Clostridium difficile infection was examined in The Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) in acute hospitals in 2006.  The survey found that thirty six patients had Clostridium difficile infection representing 0.5% of patients studied. Clostridium difficile infection increases with age and is eight times more common in patients over 65 years compared to those under the age of 65 years. The emergence of more virulent strains of Clostridium difficile which is partly due to over use of antibiotics underlines the importance of strict antibiotic stewardship in our health care system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">Clostridium difficile is one of the HCAIs and as such, the identification, surveillance and control is comprehended within the Strategy for the control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland (SARI) Strategy.  SARI was launched in 2001 and includes recommendations such as hospital hygiene practice, appropriate antibiotic prescribing, active surveillance for the detection of HCAIs, and corporate/clinical governance structures in the area of infection control.  The HSE will shortly publish a three year Action Plan which will set targets in this important area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1333">On foot of the recommendations of the Pharmacy Review Group, my Department has commenced drafting new pharmacy legislation in two pharmacy bills.</p>

I have agreed to consider the potential conflict of interest issues arising from the development of health centres with adjacent contracted pharmacies and this issue will be addressed in the second bill in the light of that examination.  In the interim, my Department has advised the Health Service Executive to take due care in assessing pharmacy contract applications so that any commercial relationship between a pharmacy contractor and a health centre will not affect the proper provision of services as required under clauses 21, 22(3), 22(4) and 23 of the pharmacy contract, dealing with ownership of pharmacies and beneficial interest.

            <p eId="para_1336">The Deputy will note that the location of services is a land use planning issue and therefore a matter for the relevant planning authority.  I am not in a position to dictate the location of privately funded and owned pharmacies or GP practices, nor to restrict the awarding of State pharmacy contracts based on location.</p>

            <p eId="para_1389">Work is proceeding in relation to each of the main recommendations made by the Task Force.  The Task Force advised that the current organisation, structure and staffing of our hospital system is failing to deliver the care that, at its best, the Irish system is capable of giving.   It further advised that patients have better outcomes when treated in hospitals with appropriate numbers of specialist staff, high volumes of activity and access to the right diagnostic and treatment facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">I am concerned that, at present, some patients are being exposed to increased risk because specialist services are being provided in some hospitals that lack the necessary critical mass of activity and patient throughput.  Patient safety and quality must be paramount and must be the key drivers in the re-configuration of our acute hospital services and, indeed, our services generally. The policy of the Government is to provide safe, high-quality services that achieve the best possible outcomes for patients. This will mean that those services that can be safely delivered locally are delivered locally and that more complex services that require specialist input are concentrated at regional centres, or in the case of highly specialised services such as organ transplantation, in national centres of excellence. This approach is consistent with international best practice for the optimum delivery of patient care. The Health Service Executive has begun the process of reorganising our acute services in order to achieve these objectives.  This will take time and, in the meantime, there will be no diminution in services available locally until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.</p>

The actions for change proposed for the development of the system were related to capacity, the mix between public and private patients and measures concerned with organisational and practical steps aimed at promoting equity, people-centredness, quality and accountability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">Together with other proposals designed to ensure that public patients obtain needed access to hospital treatment as quickly as possible, consideration was given to the establishment of a common waiting list during the deliberations stage.  The common waiting list suggestion was not proceeded with, in the final analysis.  Instead, a number of alternative proposals put forward in the Strategy were considered to be preferable as methods of obtaining the required result.  They included the following innovative proposals which, I am glad to say, are now well in train:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1396">the provision of up to 3,000 additional acute beds over ten years;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1397">the establishment of a strategic partnership with private hospital providers,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1398">the establishment of a National Hospitals Agency (now the National Hospitals Office under the HSE); and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1399">the establishment of a Treatment Purchase Fund (now the statutory National Treatment Purchase Fund).</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">In relation to the initiatives to increase the number of public beds, the following developments indicate that the Government's commitment to increase total acute bed capacity is virtually complete:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1401">In 2001,  the average number of in-patient beds/day places available for public patients in acute hospitals was 12,145.  By 2005, this number had risen to 13,255; an increase of 1,110.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1402">A further 450 bed/day places are in various stages of planning and development under the Capital Investment Framework, 2005-2009.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1403">In July 2005, I announced an initiative to have private hospitals built on the campuses of public hospitals.  The aim of this initiative is to enable up to 1,000 beds in public hospitals, which are currently used by private patients, to be redesignated for use by public patients.  The HSE is currently evaluating outline proposals from interested parties in the private sector to construct private hospitals on the sites of ten publicly funded hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">The National Treatment Purchase Fund was set up to reduce the length of time public patients are on hospital waiting lists by offering them an opportunity to obtain access to high quality treatment, quickly, safely and in line with the Government's Health Strategy.   I am very pleased at the success of the Fund to date.  Since referring its first patient in the summer of 2002, the Fund has arranged treatment for over 48,000 public patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">All of these initiatives demonstrate that the Government is meeting its commitment to improving public access to hospital care.</p>

            <p eId="para_1407">The issue of what is an appropriate method of funding the health services was discussed in the Health Strategy of 2001, which remains Government policy.  The conclusion in the Strategy was that the present system should remain as "there is no compelling evidence that any alternative approach to the tax-based system would deliver significant improvements".</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">If the question is referring to an extension of full eligibility to everyone, which the Health Strategy did not propose, then my view is that it is reasonable to expect those who can afford to pay for services to do so. There are many supports available already to those without full eligibility. These include the GP Visit Card, the Long Term Illness Scheme, treatment in a public ward of an acute hospital is free other than a modest hospital charge for non medical card holders, and the Drugs Payment Scheme contributes significantly towards the cost of pharmaceuticals.  In addition, there are reliefs available in respect of medical costs under taxation provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">The largest element of cost in extending full eligibility to the entire population would arise under the general medical services scheme.  If this were extended to the whole population, the estimated cost would be in excess of €3 billion, based on current fees to participating contractors, i.e. pharmacists and GPs in the GMS Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">This estimate takes no account of adjustments to fees to the contractors which might result from negotiations that would be required with the representative bodies of the contractors involved.  The additional costs that might arise under other schemes, such as the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) and other community services, have not been taken into account.</p>

            <p eId="para_1489">EU Commission Infringement 2004/5152 deals with the calculation of salary on the staff nurse pay scale, in particular the appropriate incremental point when experience gained in other EU countries is taken into account. The ruling, which is called a Reasoned Opinion, was addressed to Ireland by the Commission under Article 226 of the Treaty on 19 December 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490">All EU citizens are currently entitled to receive equal treatment with Irish nationals in regard to employment in the Irish public health service.  Registered nurses, regardless of nationality, receive incremental credit for genuine nursing experience gained anywhere in the world. This has been the position since 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">However, this particular case relates to service as a State Enrolled Nurse (SEN), a grade employed in the UK's health service. The SEN qualification is not recognised as a nursing qualification under Irish legislation, as training for it is deemed insufficient to qualify as a nurse registered with An Bord Altranais.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">The complaint referred to the EU was made by a nurse employed in the public health service. She argued that experience acquired in the United Kingdom as a SEN, before she was qualified as a Registered General Nurse, was not taken into account in the calculation of her salary by her Irish employers. She was seeking recognition for incremental purposes of her service as a SEN in the UK for a period of over 16 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">The Rights Commissioner Service and the Labour Court, who adjudicated on the claim in 2004, both found that management was within its rights not to recognise periods of service as a  SEN in the UK for incremental credit purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">This case was subsequently referred to the EU Commission who found, under Infringement No. 2004/5152, that Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 39 of the European Community by not making a comparison between the experience acquired by a worker in the UK, and the type of experience acquired in Ireland, in calculating the salary of registered general nurses. The ruling does not deal with the application process or eligibility conditions for posts in the public health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1495">I have accepted the EU ruling and my Department has informed the Health Service Executive — Employers Agency of the outcome of the complaint. The HSE-EA is arranging for a circular letter on the matter to issue very shortly to all public health service employers. The circular will direct that incremental credit be granted on appointment as a Registered General Nurse, on the basis of one increment for every three years service as a SEN, with a seventh increment being given for twenty years service. The EU Commission have been informed accordingly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1500">The practice of imputing 5% of the value of a person's principal private residence in certain defined circumstances is not new. It has applied since the introduction of the subvention scheme under Regulations made in 1993. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993 provide for the payment of subvention for private nursing home care for applicants who qualify on both medical and means grounds.  General rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for nursing home subvention are set out in the Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993, as amended by the Nursing Homes(Subvention)(Amendment) Regulations 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">When carrying out a means test for the purposes of subvention, the applicant's home is not taken into account in certain circumstances, for example, where it is occupied by a spouse, a child under 21 or a relative in receipt of certain social welfare payments. If none of these situations apply, 5% of the imputed value of the person's principal private residence is taken into account as part of the financial assessment. This situation has applied since the subvention regulations were introduced in 1993.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">An Inter-Departmental Group was set up to examine financially sustainable models of long-term care. The Group reported to Government, and Government agreed on a number of principles that are reflected in the new social partnership agreement "Towards 2016". That agreement describes a whole range of initiatives covering new arrangements for residential and community care for older people. The Inter-Departmental Group has continued to meet to help draw up proposals for a new policy on long-term care, based on the principles endorsed by Government and the social partners. One of these principles is that, where residential care is required, there should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients, based on a standardised financial assessment. The aim will be to achieve an equitable, balanced scheme, both for residential and community care, and for both public and private provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1503">The Deputy will be aware that the social partners comprise representatives of Government, employers, trade unions, the farming sector and the community and voluntary pillar.</p>

            <p eId="para_1505">Despite the substantial decline in the prevalence and severity of dental cavities in Ireland since 1964, this largely preventable disease is still common. Fluoridation of community drinking water is a major factor responsible for the decline in dental caries. 71% of the Irish population live in areas with fluoridated water supplies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">In Ireland, according to the preliminary National Children's Survey (2002) report, over 2/3rds (69.5%) of 5 year olds with fluoridated water had no decay in their teeth, and 52.5% of 5 years olds without water fluoridation have no dental decay.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">According to the same report, one third of 15 year olds in fluoridated water areas are free of dental decay and approximately one quarter (26%) of those living in non-fluoridated water areas have no dental decay in their permanent dentition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1508">Dental decay is an infectious disease that affects most people in developed countries. There are many factors involved in the development of dental decay, the main factors being a susceptible tooth, sugar and bacteria in dental plaque. Data from the ‘Health Behaviour of Children in School' report found that of all the countries surveyed the percentage of students who reported eating sweets or chocolate every day was consistently higher in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Ireland (71-80%). The consumption of soft drinks has increased considerably in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1509">The Health Service Executive is responsible for planning oral health care. Since 2000, all children under the age of 16 years who attended state primary schools have access to free dental care through the public dental service. Children aged 7, 9 and 12 are targeted for screening and for application of preventive measures, oral health education, fluoride mouth rinsing in non-fluoridated areas and fissure sealing of vulnerable permanent molar teeth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1510">A number of initiatives have been undertaken to address oral health promotion recently:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1511">Winning Smiles is a school based oral health programme.  Launched by the Taoiseach it is a north/south initiative involving Queens University Belfast, the Oral Health Research Centre and Dental Health Foundation.

            <p eId="para_1517">The 2006 estimates for the Health Service Executive includes €60 million to open new facilities built under the National Development Plan.  These new facilities include additional in-patient beds and day treatment places in acute hospitals. The HSE has indicated that when fully opened these new facilities will provide an additional 97 in-patient beds, 68 day treatment places and 7 intensive care / high dependency beds. A total of 172 treatment places in acute hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1518">In addition, a further 450 acute beds/day places are in various stages of planning and development under the Health Service Executive's Capital Plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1519">All of these additional in-patient beds/day places will mean that this Government's commitment in the Health Strategy to increase total acute hospital capacity is well on the way to completion.</p>

Many consultants at individual hospital level are keen to do this and have expressed their support for the initiative to me.</p>

            <p eId="para_1532">The National Cancer Control Strategy encompasses all aspects of cancer, including prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, supportive and palliative care.  My objective is to develop an integrated cancer control programme based on:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1533">evidence of what works to prevent and treat cancer;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1534">standards that assure quality in all aspects of cancer control; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1535">fairness, so that all patients, irrespective of county, region or personal financial means, can be assured of the best cancer care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">Our efforts to prevent cancer will include societal and public policy responses to reduce smoking and alcohol misuse and improve diet and exercise.  I have written to the Minister for Finance on fiscal measures to reduce the consumption of tobacco.  Heads of a Bill are being prepared for consideration by Government to regulate the use of sunbeds, including prohibiting their use by those under 16.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">I will shortly establish a National Cancer Screening Service to amalgamate BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme (ICSP) to deliver both programmes nationally.  BreastCheck will commence national roll-out next year.  It is my goal to have the ICSP rolled out nationally by 2008, based on an affordable model.  The Service will also advise in relation to a colorectal cancer screening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">My Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive and the National Development Finance Agency to progress the delivery of the National Radiation Oncology Plan.  I have approved the provision of two additional linear accelerators at St. Luke's Hospital to provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the national plan.  I expect these services to commence late next year.  Last week I also announced the approval of two radiation oncology facilities at Beaumont and St. James's Hospitals, comprising of two linear accelerators and associated treatment planning at each site, to be delivered in early 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">The HSE is establishing a National Cancer Control Programme that will build on the significant investment that has been made in the development of cancer control since 1997.  A Programme Director, at national level, will be accountable for all HSE cancer control activities.  A single national budget for all cancer control activities will be developed.  The Programme will facilitate national standards for equity and access and will maximise ambulatory care.  The HSE will establish four Managed Cancer Control Networks to deliver the Programme.  Clinical leaders in oncology will be appointed to lead the delivery of quality multi-disciplinary care.  I intend to invest substantially in cancer control based on the reform programme I have outlined.</p>

            <p eId="para_1548">The Forum on Fluoridation was established by the Minister for Health and Children to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland.

            <p eId="para_1550">The Forum reported that the re-defined optimal level of fluoride would be sufficient — along with the continued use of fluoride toothpaste — to maintain meaningful reductions in dental decay rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">In all, the Report of the Fluoridation Forum made thirty-three recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation and the establishment of an Expert Body to oversee the implementation of the recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health (the Expert Body) was set up in 2004.

            <p eId="para_1560">The Action Plan for Dementia, published in 1999, outlines the complexity and range of issues involved in the effective management of dementia. The plan emphasises the need for the development of co-ordinated, multi-layered and well-resourced services, which are responsive to the individual needs of people with dementia and of those who care for them. The Action Plan describes a model of best practice for the provision and planning of dementia care in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">The recommendations in the plan include increased funding, changes to service delivery mechanisms, expanded Old Age Psychiatry services, increased support for family carers and provision of day care and respite services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">Since the report was published, community supports have been enhanced over the years and increased levels of funding have been made available to develop a wide range of community based services, including community nursing, paramedical services, home help services, and support to family carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">In Budget 2006, additional funding was provided to further enhance services for older people, including €30m for Home Care Packages, €30m for the Home Help Service, €7m for Day/Respite Care, €2m for Old Age Psychiatry Service and €15m for the Development of Primary Care Teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_1564">In terms of dementia specific services, new day care centres and residential units have been designed and developed in partnership with the Alzheimer's Society. Home care services have also been specifically developed to meet the needs of persons with Alzheimer's and their carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">The additional funding provided under Home Care Packages and the Home Help Scheme will further enhance the supports available to families caring for people with dementia at home.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">In August 2006 the Alzheimer Society of Ireland published "Perceptions of Stigma in Dementia: An Exploratory Study" in conjunction with the School of Nursing and Midwifery, Trinity College, Dublin.  The HSE has advised that it will work closely with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, as is the case at present, in examining the various recommendations of this report in the context of services for older people.</p>

            <p eId="para_1568">Private health insurance companies do not pay public hospitals €1billion in respect of private beds in public hospitals. The €1billion paid out by private health insurance companies is an estimate of the total payments by the companies in respect of consultant fees, claims from private hospitals claims from public hospitals and claims in respect of out-patient services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">Our initial estimate of the income which could be lost by the public hospitals which was published with the policy direction back in July 2005 was €145m. This initial estimate was calculated in advance of the identification by the HSE of the public hospitals that would be participating in this initiative. However, in 2005 the private health insurance income to the 10 hospital sites selected as sites for co location was €111m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">Additional income to the hospitals in respect of the lease of the land will off set the loss of income from the private health insurers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">It has always been accepted that there will be a loss of income to the hospitals and that any net loss will have to be met by the exchequer.

            <p eId="para_1574">I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 188 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects data on MRSA bacteraemia (also known as bloodstream infection or "blood poisoning") as part of the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS).  EARSS collects data on the first episode of blood stream infection per patient per quarter.   The Irish data for EARSS, which is published on a quarterly basis by the HPSC, showed that there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 586 cases in 2005 and 285 reported cases in the first half of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">It is difficult to identify the number of fatalities attributable to MRSA as many people also have significant co-morbidity factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">This year, Ireland participated in the Hospital Infection Society's "Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections" (HCAIs) in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The survey provides accurate and comparable data on the prevalence of Health Care Associated Infections (including MRSA) in acute hospitals in Ireland and can also be compared with similar data being obtained in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Preliminary results of this study are now available. The overall prevalence of health-care associated infection in the UK and Ireland study (these figures exclude Scotland) is 7.9%. The England figure is 8.2%, Wales 6.3%, Northern Ireland 5.5% and the Republic of Ireland 4.9%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">As expected, the prevalence of health-care associated infection was highest in regional/tertiary hospitals at 6% and lowest in specialist hospitals at 2%. 10% of patients with a health-care associated infection in the Republic of Ireland were recorded as having an MRSA related health-care infection. This is lower than the UK average of 16%. While the overall prevalence is lower in Ireland than UK, further analysis needs to be done before the true implications of this survey become clear.</p>
            <p eId="para_1579">Measures to control the emergence and spread of HCAIs are necessary because there are fewer options available for the treatment of resistant infections and because these strains spread amongst vulnerable at-risk patients. The prudent use of antibiotics underpins any approach to the control of antibiotic resistant bacteria, including MRSA.  This, together with good professional practice and routine infection control precautions, such as hand hygiene, constitute the major measures in controlling and preventing healthcare-associated infection, including that caused by MRSA, both in hospital and in community health care units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">A Strategy for the control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland (SARI) was launched in 2001 and includes recommendations such as hospital hygiene practise, appropriate antibiotic prescribing, active surveillance for the detection of MRSA and corporate/clinical governance structures in the area of infection control. At present, active recruitment is ongoing within the HSE nationally to employ essential infection control staff such as infection control nurses, hospital liaison pharmacists, surveillance scientists and clinical microbiologists. The HSE are shortly to publish a three year Action Plan which will set targets in this important area.</p>

The Bill will also provide for a registration system in respect of residential services for children, older people and people with disabilities to replace existing registration procedures in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Child Care Act 1991 and 2001.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1588">The Medical Practitioners Bill will replace the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978 which established the Medical Council and provides for the registration of doctors and the regulation of their activities.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1589">The Pharmacy Bill – No. 1 will provide fitness to practise regulations for pharmacists and the removal of the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU or EEA countries from managing or supervising a pharmacy in Ireland that is less than three years old — a derogation under Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC.  It is  also proposed to provide for an appropriate statutory basis for the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and certain competency issues.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1590">3.  Heads agreed and Bills being drafted:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1591">The Voluntary Health Insurance Board Bill will address VHI's corporate status and related matters.  I expect to publish the Bill in December.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1592">The Adoption (Hague Convention, Adoption Authority) Bill will ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children in respect of Intercountry Adoption.   The Bill will provide for the creation of the Adoption Authority (replacing the Adoption Board) as the Central Authority required under the terms of the Convention to oversee the implementation of the Convention in effecting Intercountry adoptions.  The Bill will also provide for miscellaneous issues dealing with domestic adoption.  I expect to publish the Bill in early 2007.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1593">4.  Heads not yet approved:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1594">The Nurses and Midwives Bill will modernise the regulatory framework for nurses and midwives.  It will update and amend the Nurses Act, 1985 in order to reflect and to respond to the significant changes which the health services and nursing and midwifery professions have undergone since 1985.    Publication is expected in 2007.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1595">The Eligibility for Health and Personal Social Services Bill will clarify and update the present provisions relating to eligibility for health and personal social services.   Publication is expected in 2007.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1596">Legal advice relating to the area of registering persons who are unsafe to work with children is being examined with a view to bringing forward legislation to address this issue.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1597">The Public Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will provide for the prohibition of the use of sunbeds by those under 16 years of age together with minor amendments to the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act.    Work on the draft heads is proceeding.  I expect to submit draft Heads to Government for approval by the end of this year.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1598">Work will begin on the Pharmacy Bill — No. 2, which will deal with other changes in the regulatory framework for pharmacy and pharmacy services and other recommendations of the Pharmacy Review Group, as soon as the first Pharmacy Bill is enacted.    Its date of publication is dependent on progress of the first Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_1600">The Deputy will be aware that, in Budget 2006, an investment package of €150m was announced for additional services for Older People and Palliative Care. This package included €55m for the rolling out of 2,000 additional Home Care Packages.  €30m of this was for 2006, with the remaining €25m for 2007. Of this €30m, a total of €3.6m was allocated to the former Northern Area Health Board area, based on the percentage of the population aged over 65.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">At the 30th of September 2006, a total of some 900 Home Care Packages were being delivered in the former Northern Area Health Board area, 700 of which commenced since the 1st of January this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1602">Home Care Packages are delivered to persons either to facilitate their earlier discharge from an acute hospital, or to prevent admission to acute hospitals or long term residential care, where this is not necessary. The level of service to be provided is based on an overall assessment of the applicant's medical and social care needs, and the family or other supports available to the applicant, which determines the suitability of the applicant for care in the home. Home care packages consist of a mixture of grants, contracted care services, therapeutic input, equipment and other such community services as determined by a needs assessment to facilitate an older person to remain living in their own home. They vary according to the care needs of the person so that, for example, there might be a greater emphasis in some packages on home care assistance while other packages may require a greater level of therapy and nursing.</p>

The lowest level of geography distinguished in the report was Electoral Divisions (EDs). This was possible as the enumeration areas chosen for census collection were organised along ED lines.</p>

Volume 1, dealing with Areas, which is due to be published in May 2007 will give population figures for every town with 50 or more occupied households. This will include the town of Foxford in County Mayo. It is important to bear in mind that in addition to publishing the population of legally defined towns, other towns are also shown. This requires a careful examination of enumerator maps to determine the precise boundary of the town at the time of the census, taking account of housing development since the previous census.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_1662">The Explosives Act, 1875 provides for the control of the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks.  That Act was amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 and, on 1 August, 2006 I signed an order bringing all sections of the Act relating to fireworks into immediate effect.   These amendments provide for new offences governing the possession of illegal fireworks with intent to supply and misuse of fireworks in public places.  They also provide for significantly increased penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1663">Under the new provisions it is an offence:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1664">for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1665">to throw an ignited firework at any person or property; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1666">to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">The penalty for such offences is as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1668">a fine of up to €2,500 or 6 months imprisonment or both on summary conviction; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1669">a fine of up to €10,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both on conviction on indictment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670">The simple possession of fireworks without a licence is also an offence for which a person may be liable to a fine of up to €10,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">Every effort is made by the Gardaí to identify persons involved in the illegal importation and sale of fireworks and where necessary specific policing plans are put in place in areas where particular problems arise.  Each year, leading up to Halloween, special efforts are made by the Gardaí to combat the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks and this year an intelligence led operation called "Operation Tombola" was launched on 25 September.  To date this operation has resulted in 42 seizures of fireworks with an estimated value of €104,876.  Over the last five years such operations have resulted in seizures valued at over €2 million. All fireworks seized are forfeited by the person importing them and destroyed in accordance with the provisions of the Explosives Act 1875.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">I am confident that, following the introduction of the new offences and penalties, Garda operations will be even more effective in combating the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</p>

         his views on building a prison on Spike Island which requires a bridge and road network to be put in place before substantial building work can commence which may delay the provision of a replacement prison for the overcrowded and outdated Cork Prison compared to a possible alternative site that would have the necessary infrastructure directly adjacent to it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1699">There are only two sites currently available to the Irish Prison Service in the Cork region for prison development.   The existing site in Cork city has been considered in detail and is not deemed to be suitable.  The prison facility on Spike Island offers obvious advantages from a security perspective and is immediately available for development.    No other sites in the Cork region have been offered  for prison development.</p>

            <p eId="para_1909">The personnel strength of the Kerry Division as at 31 December, 1997 was 230 (all ranks). The personnel strength of the Kerry Division as at 25 October, 2006 was 290 (all ranks). This represents an increase of 60 (or 26%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1910">Rathmore Garda Station is situated in County Kerry but is policed by the Cork West Garda Division. The personnel strength of Rathmore Garda Station as at 31 December, 1997 and 25 October, 2006 was 2 (all ranks) and 1 (all ranks), respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1911">In addition, I would point out to the Deputy that the Division's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1912">It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1913">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Kerry Division will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

        <b>Ms C. Murphy</b>

         if, in view of his publically stated commitment to the rights of victims of crime, and the ongoing problems faced by the families of missing persons, he will reinstate funding to a dedicated missing person’s helpline in order that victims, their families and persons wishing to provide information on such cases are given every assistance possible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_1915">The disappearance of any person is  traumatic for their family and friends,  and for this reason I am anxious to assist them in any way I can.  I am of the view that a helpline for this purpose is best set up on an independent basis and  by a non-official, voluntary organisation.  Any proposals for funding for such a purpose which are made to my Department will be carefully considered on their merits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">In March 2005, I established a new Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and to disburse funding for victim support measures.  The Commission is entirely independent in its decision making and examines each application on its merits. It should be borne in mind in this context that the Commission is charged with funding support services for victims of crime, and that, while some persons who are missing are crime victims, most are not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1917">The Missing Persons Bureau in Garda Headquarters is responsible for maintaining data relating to missing persons.  All cases of a person reported missing in suspicious circumstances remain open and under ongoing review and investigation until the person is located or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect by the coroner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">At present, local Garda management take direct responsibility for missing person cases, and special investigation teams are appointed as necessary.  All missing persons are recorded on the PULSE system.  When a person is reported missing, the local Garda Superintendent  will appoint an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary, for example, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation or the Technical Bureau.  The systems put in place by An Garda Síochána to manage and deal with reports of missing persons are in line with best international police practice, and Garda management have assured me that they are satisfied that the systems in place are adequate to deal with any reported case of a missing person.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">An Garda Síochána interacts fully and as appropriate with all of the media outlets — print, radio and TV — in highlighting cases involving missing persons.  The services of other external agencies such as Interpol and Europol are also available to assist in the investigation.  In addition, every Garda District has a specially trained search team that is familiar with the locality.  The investigation of missing persons is a dedicated subject on the curriculum at the Garda College, Templemore, and is also a subject covered in in-service training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">The Garda authorities are continuously monitoring international developments in relation to investigations of missing persons in order  to ensure that best practice is followed.  If their professional judgement is that some change in the existing legislation, protocols or structures would be of assistance in improving investigations, this would be considered by me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1921">A proposal for funding has been received in my Department from the Missing In Ireland Support Service to restore the National Missing Persons Helpline and officials are currently examining the proposal.  A response on this proposal will issue to the organisation in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1925">I presume that the Deputy is referring to applications for Leave to Remain in the State made pursuant to Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_1926">An application for Leave to Remain in the State in these circumstances arises where a non-national person is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(a) of the Immigration Act, 1999. A person served with such a notice of intent to deport is afforded three options, viz. to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a Deportation Order; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and why temporary Leave to Remain in the State be granted instead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1927">In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996.  Temporary leave to remain is considered in every case regardless of whether representations are made by, or on behalf of, the persons concerned. Statistics are not maintained in a way which distinguishes between those who have made an application for leave to remain and those who have not. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that many of those who failed the asylum process, and who did not opt to return voluntarily or consent to deportation, nonetheless left the State before a decision to deport or grant leave to remain was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1928">The figures in the table below refer to persons who received a notification of intention to deport under Section 3(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 but were subsequently granted temporary leave to remain in the State for an initial period of one year. The majority of these would have been persons who were refused refugee status in the State.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_1947">I can inform the Deputy that strong provisions are in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, which modernised the law in this regard.  Furthermore, because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I brought forward tough provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1948">More recently, I brought forward additional provisions, which were enacted in the Criminal Justice Act, 2006, to deal with anti-social behaviour.  The Act empowers a senior member of the Garda Síochána to apply to the District Court by way of a civil procedure for an order which will prohibit an adult from behaving in an anti-social manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1949">Separate provision is being made in relation to young people.  The Act introduces provisions for behaviour orders for children aged 12 to 18 years into the Children Act, 2001 and the protections of that Act will apply.  There will be a series of incremental stages, with parental involvement, preceding an application for a behaviour order.  These include a warning, a good behaviour contract and referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme.  Only after these stages can a behaviour order be sought through the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1950">The relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 will be commenced following consultations between my Department, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána. These consultations are currently ongoing. The purpose of this is to ensure that these provisions will commence as soon as the Commissioner has made the necessary internal arrangements to ensure the smooth introduction of these new procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1951">I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána has a pro-active approach to policing anti-social/public disorder issues by immediate intervention, arrest and prosecutions or advice, as appropriate. Local Garda management  provide for this in policing plans and make every effort to provide a highly visible police presence on the streets of our towns and villages through the deployment of uniform Gardaí, detective units, divisional traffic corps, community policing units and mountain bike units as appropriate.  Garda patrols pay particular attention to areas where the public tends to congregate such as licensed venues and fast food outlets while awaiting transport, so as to prevent and detect incidents of public disorder.</p>
            <p eId="para_1952">Insofar as the resources available to the Gardaí are concerned, the position is that these have been increased significantly in recent years.  The personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  Furthermore, the Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1953">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year and the Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these considerable additional resources.</p>

Notwithstanding this exemption, the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) includes in all contracts requirements that the contractor comply, at all times, with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, and in particular with the requirements of the Local Authority Fire Officer.

            <p eId="para_1967">In this regard, and before the initial contract at Balseskin started, the contractors treated this requirement as if it was an application to the local authority for a fire safety certificate and lodged all appropriate drawings and plans with the OPW.

            <p eId="para_1972">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength (all ranks) of Shankill, Dalkey, Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock, Kill O Grange and Cabinteely Garda stations as at 31 December, 1997 to 2005, inclusively, and as at 26 October, 2006 was as set out in the table below:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1974">The personnel strength (all ranks) of the DMR as at 31 December, 1997 and 31 October, 2006 was 3,399 and 4,045, respectively. This represents an increase of 646 (or 19%) in the number of personnel allocated to the DMR during that period.</p>

            <p eId="para_2052">I have also been informed that the area of Deansgrange is located in the Dún Laoghaire sub-district and is policed by Kill O Grange Garda station. Shankill, Dalkey, Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock, Kill O Grange and Cabinteely Garda Stations all form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR).</p>
            <p eId="para_2053">The DMR's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units, all of which have had increased resources to provide a comprehensive policing service to the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_2054">It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_2055">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the DMR will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_2057">No data are available on the percentage of the adult population that has made a will. However, the 2005 Annual Report of the Courts Service indicates that of the 15,671  applications made to the Probate Office in the year under review 11,328 (72.3%) were in respect of wills having been made and 4,343 (27.7%) were in cases without a will having been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2058">The policy of the Succession Act 1965 ensures particular distributions of the estate of a deceased person whether or not a will is made and whether or not there are any children of the deceased.  The Legal Aid Board provides a leaflet on the making of a will and the Courts Service provides a leaflet on the service provided by its Probate Office.  The contents of both leaflets may be accessed on their respective websites. In addition, the Citizens Information website — provided by Comhairle — gives comprehensive information on the subject.</p>
            <p eId="para_2059">The Deputy will be aware that solicitors are normally in the best position to advise their clients on the merits of making a will and the need for care in doing so.  The Law Society has, on occasion, promoted the case for making a will.</p>

            <p eId="para_2062">Subject to the provisions of the Immigration Act 2004, an Immigration Officer may, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, give a non-national a document, or place in his or her passport or other equivalent document an inscription, authorising the non-national to land or be in the State.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_520">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_2066">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength (all ranks) of Dunboyne and Slane Garda Stations as at 27 October, 2006 was 14 and 3, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">I have also been informed that Dunboyne and Slane Garda stations are located within the Louth/Meath Division. The personnel strength of the Louth/Meath Division as at 27 October, 2006 was 541 (all ranks). The personnel strength of the Louth/Meath Division as at 31 December, 1997 was 498 (all ranks). This represents an increase of 43 (or 9%) in the number of personnel allocated to the Division during that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2069">In addition, I would point out to the Deputy that the Division's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.</p>
            <p eId="para_2070">It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_2071">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Louth/Meath Division will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_2073">The Dóchas Centre comprises seven houses as well as a dedicated healthcare unit.   There is an average of twelve predominantly single occupancy bedrooms with en-suite facilities in each house.  A television is provided in each room.  Each house also contains domestic style cooking, laundry and recreational facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">All sentenced and remand prisoners in the Dóchas Centre have access to a wide range of services and facilities — including medical, psychological, psychiatric, dentistry, chaplaincy, educational, work training, library and recreational.</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">Medical, psychological, psychiatric, dentistry and chaplaincy services are provided by a combination of persons who visit the Centre on a full time, part time and sessional basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">Educational classes and courses are provided by a team of full and part-time teachers in a specially designed Education Unit.    Courses offered cover a wide range of academic and practical skills — including Parenting, Home Economics, Drug Awareness, Addiction Studies, Office Skills, Typing/Word Processing, Computers, English, Maths/Numeracy and, Leather and Fabric Crafts.   Work and Training opportunities include catering, hairdressing and sewing skills.  As part of the roll out of the Proposal for Organisational Change, additional work/training staff will be appointed shortly which will facilitate an increase in the range of vocational activities and opportunities available in the Dóchas Centre.   All prisoners have access to a fully fitted out gymnasium and sports hall.  There is also a television installed in the recreation area in each House in the Dóchas Centre as well as in each individual room.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">Sentenced prisoners are allowed one visit a week but additional visits may be granted from time to time at the discretion of the Governor.  Remand prisoners are  allowed one visit each day — with the exception of Sunday — but additional visits may be granted at the discretion of the Governor.  Visits are supervised by staff but are open.   Every effort is made to allow mothers as much flexibility as is possible on visits with their children.  There is no statutory entitlement for mothers to have their children stay with them in the Dóchas Centre — although Rule 20 of the Government of Prisons 1947 provides that a child of a female prisoner may be received into prison in certain circumstances.  I should add that this Rule is, however, being revised under Rule 19 of the new draft Prison Rules which are available on my Department's web-site.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">All prisoners may make a phone call of six minutes duration to a nominated person each day.  Organisations who visit the Dóchas Centre include Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), St Vincent de Paul, Befrienders, Samaritans, Legion of Mary, Tús Nua, Ruhama and Coolmine.</p>
            <p eId="para_2079">In January, 1996, the Government gave approval for the construction of a new Women's Prison at the Mountjoy Prison Complex.   The construction cost was €17.2 million, which included all the costs associated with the construction of both the new prison and a 300 space multistorey car park, adjacent to St. Patrick's Institution, to service the entire prison complex at Mountjoy.  Roughly one quarter of the costs are attributable to the multistorey car park.</p>
            <p eId="para_2080">The total cost of maintenance and improvement works for the Dóchas Centre since it opened to date is approximately €1.5 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">Figures indicate that on 31 October, 2006 there were 91 persons in custody in the Dóchas Centre, of which 61 are serving a sentence. A breakdown of the sentence lengths are outlined in the table below.</p>

            <p eId="para_2109">By way of background, it should be noted that the effect of a deportation order when served on a person is that the person concerned is legally obliged to leave the State and to thereafter remain out of the State.  Additionally, it should be borne in mind that while Section 3(2) of the Immigration Act, 1999 — the relevant legislation in this area — provides for a deportation order to be made in a variety of circumstances, in practical terms, deportation orders tend to be made based on the provisions of Section 3(2)(f) of the Act, that is, where the persons concerned have failed all stages of the asylum process and Section 3(2)(i) of the Act, that is, where the persons have otherwise become illegal in the State such as where they have overstayed a work permit or a study or holiday visa etc.  It should also be borne in mind that all deportation orders, regardless of the specified headings they are made under, are equal in value, legally and operationally.  For example, a person who would be liable to deportation on the grounds of a prison sentence might also be liable to be deported as an overstayer.  The effect is the same.</p>
            <p eId="para_2110">Each case is considered on its individual merits having regard to the gravity of the offence committed as well as what, if any, other connection each individual has to the State.  For example, if a non-EU national prisoner has a legal entitlement to be in the State, for example, as a recognised refugee or as a person who has availed of EU Treaty Rights through marriage to an Irish or an EU National, they would clearly be less likely to be deported.  Where a person has been here for some time and their children have settled here it would be necessary to consider the impact that deportation would have on the family unit.  Where no such legal entitlement to be in the State exists, and the offence committed was of a serious nature, there is every likelihood that the person in question would be deported at the time of their release from prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_2111">There is no provision in Irish law for the automatic deportation of a non-national person who has committed a criminal offence.  Section 3(2) of the Immigration Act, 1999 sets out nine categories of persons in respect of whom the Minister can make a deportation order.  Included are (i) persons who have served or are serving a term of imprisonment imposed on them by a Court in the State, (ii) persons whose deportations have been recommended by a Court in the State before which they have been indicted or charged with a crime or an offence and (iii) persons whose deportation would, in the opinion of the Minister, be conducive to the public good.</p>

            <p eId="para_2113">The Sex Offenders Act which commenced on 27 September 2001 sets out the obligations on persons convicted of a range of sexual offences against both children and adults.  A convicted sex offender must notify his/her name(s), date of birth and current home address to the Garda Síochána within seven days of the conviction for the sexual offence concerned or, where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of full release from prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_2114">Thereafter, the offender must notify the Gardaí of any change of name or address within seven days of that change.  Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any twelve month period must also be given to the Gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">If the offender intends to leave the State for a period of seven days or more s/he must inform the Gardaí of this fact and the address at which s/he intends to stay and also notify the Gardaí of his/her return. If s/he did not intend to stay away for more than seven days but did, s/he must inform the Gardaí within a further seven days.  The provisions of the Act extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries or who have been convicted abroad of an offence comparable to one covered by the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2116">Part 4 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides that it is an offence for convicted sex offenders to apply for, or to accept, work or to offer services, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of unsupervised access to, or contact with, children or mentally impaired persons, without informing the employer or organisation of his/her conviction for a qualifying sexual offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2117">It is an offence to fail to comply with the notification requirements. The penalty is imprisonment for up to 12 months or a fine of €1,900 or both.  The courts can also sentence an offender who has been found guilty of an offence under the schedule of offences in the Act to a period of statutory supervision under the Probation and Welfare Service on their release from prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_2118">Before an offender is released from prison, the Prison Service must inform him/her that they are subject to the notification requirement of the Act. Ten days before the date of release, the Prison Service must inform the Garda Síochána that s/he is being released.</p>
            <p eId="para_2119">The Garda Síochána has in place a system for the monitoring of persons subject to these requirements. The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit monitor and manage the notification provisions. The information on persons who are subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 is maintained at a central location. Only specified nominated Garda personnel have access to this information.</p>
            <p eId="para_2120">There are nominated Garda Inspectors in each Garda Division who are notified by the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit when a sex offender, who is subject to the requirements of the Act, is resident in their Division. These inspectors are responsible for the monitoring of such offenders.  The Garda authorities are currently preparing to computerise the system for recording persons subject to the requirements of the Act and integrate it into the PULSE system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2121">As of the 27 October, 2006 there were 972 persons subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Act.  The Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill 2006, which has been approved by Government and forwarded to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting, contains amendments and additions to the Act, including amendments to the notification system. The Joint Committee on Child Protection is at present examining a wide range of issues relating to the protection of children, in particular protection against sexual abuse. The Committee is due to report back to each House with recommendations in a final report by 30 November 2006. I will await completion of that report before considering any further changes to the operation of the notification system.</p>

They had previously applied for asylum in 2002 and had withdrawn this application on the basis of the birth of an Irish born child.  Their application was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on 19 May, 2004 and 25 May, 2004.  Their subsequent appeal was refused by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and they were notified of this recommendation by letter on 23 September, 2004 and 27 September, 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the people concerned were informed on 6 December, 2004 and 30 December, 2004 that the Minister was proposing to make a deportation order in respect of them.  They were in accordance with the Act, given the option of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons why they should not be deported i.e. be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before the deportation order was made; or consenting to the making of the deportation order.   The persons concerned applied to remain in State on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child born before 1 January, 2005.  This permission to remain was subsequently refused on 12 January, 2006.   An additional notification of intention to issue a deportation order was issued on 13 October, 2006.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_2133">The recently published provisional headline crime statistics for the third quarter of 2006 show a decrease of 1.6% for the quarter compared with the same quarter in 2005.  Looking at long term crime trends, the level of headline crime in 2005 was lower than that in 2003 by 1.6% and that in 2002 by 4.4%.  Furthermore, in 1995, when we had a population of almost 3.6 million, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population, while in 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population — 15% crimes less per 1,000 of the population.</p>
            <p eId="para_2134">I am determined that disturbing trends will be addressed as they are identified and, despite an increasing population, we should continue to enjoy relatively low crime rates. High on the Government's list of policing priorities for 2006, which have been incorporated into the Garda Síochána Policing Plan for the year, is the continued targeting of organised crime, including drug trafficking, and the gun culture associated with it through the use of specialist units and targeted, intelligence-led operations.  Garda strategies are in place for dealing with drug offences which are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs. These strategies include gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in the distribution of drugs, conducting targeted operations on criminal networks based on intelligence gathered and working in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies both within and outside the jurisdiction to address the national and international aspects of drug trafficking and distribution.  These strategies continue to result in operational successes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2135">While it is the case that a number of the increases in headline crime statistics reflect increased enforcement activity on the part of An Garda Síochána, the overall picture indicates there is no room for complacency.  The Government's decision to continue to devote unprecedented resources to the fight against crime shows that it is not complacent, as does my insistence that those resources be deployed at the front line of policing in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2136">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_2137">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2138">Operation Anvil commenced in the Garda Dublin Metropolitan Region on 17 May, 2005.  It is an intelligence led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting this criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static check points by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  The Operation remains in place and is on-going in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  It was extended nationwide in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2139">Outside the Dublin Metropolitan Region, a series of special operations, prepared by senior Garda managers and designed to focus on areas and incidents of high crime, has been initiated.  These operations are focused with particular targets identified.  A number of these operations have been completed, while further are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2140">Operation Anvil has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in recorded crime in the target crime areas under the operation.  A budget of approximately €11 million has been allocated for Operation Anvil during 2006, and the Garda Commissioner has been advised that an additional €10 million has been made available for further operations to tackle gang related crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_2141">In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.  Operation Anvil will continue to be funded to the extent and as long as the Commissioner considers that it is necessary to do so and it is fulfilling its objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_2142">With regard to legislative measures, the Deputy will be aware that the recently enacted Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the Gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of offences. In addition, the Act contains an essential updating of our criminal law to ensure that criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society.  The Act addresses a wide range of matters including the designation of a place as a crime scene, increased detention powers for certain offences, the admissibility of statements by witnesses who subsequently refuse to testify or who retract their original statements, the creation of new offences in relation to organised crime and the misuse of drugs, the strengthening of  existing provisions in relation to sentencing for drug trafficking offences; provisions to update and strengthen the law in relation to firearms and fireworks and provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">With effect from today the following provisions come into effect:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2144">mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2145">new offences concerning the modification of firearms such as "sawing-off" a shotgun.</p>
            <p eId="para_2146">The Government gave approval on 27 July, 2006 for the drafting of a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2006 which includes a number of provisions aimed at introducing certain changes and improvements in the operation of the Criminal Justice system. It is expected that drafting of the Bill in question will be completed early in 2007. The purpose of the Bill is twofold. Firstly, it will provide for miscellaneous, mainly technical, changes to the criminal law in relation to a number of statutes. These changes include the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2147">provision for a presumption of continuity of evidence in relation to secure storage of Audio/video recordings;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2148">provisions dealing with giving evidence in Court by Garda Technical Bureau staff;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2149">consecutive sentences for offences committed on bail by amending Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2150">consideration of the definition of harassment as currently contained in Section 10 of the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2151">allowing for the separation of Juries during trials; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2152">amendments to the European Arrest Warrant Act, 2003 arising from experience of operation of the provisions of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2153">Secondly, the Bill will also give legislative effect to a number of international instruments relating to criminal law, these include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2154">Article 15 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime which requires the signatories to establish jurisdiction over certain offences, including money laundering when the offence is committed in the territory of the State or outside it or on a vessel or aircraft registered to the State.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2155">The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which is the first international treaty dealing with criminal offences by means of, or against, computer networks, in particular child pornography, computer related fraud, network security and infringement of copyright. The aim of the Convention is to pursue a common criminal approach aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2156">An OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. A number of recommendations made by an OECD Working Party following an evaluation in 2002 in relation to this provision, will be included in the Bill.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2157">The Framework Decision on Combating Corruption in the Private Sector, which was adopted in July 2003. Ireland's anti-corruption legislation already has extensive measures which largely comply with the requirements of this Framework Decision. The Bill provides an opportunity to deal with any outstanding issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2158">The Bill will also contain provisions which are largely procedural in nature, the aims of which are to facilitate the operation in Ireland of the Schengen Information System.</p>
            <p eId="para_2159">In addition to the drafting of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006,  work has commenced on a General Scheme of a Criminal Justice (Money Laundering) Bill which will have the effect of transposing the European Communities 3rd Money Laundering Directive into Irish law.</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">Preparatory work on a General Scheme of a Bill, which will allow Ireland to ratify the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, is also underway and it is intended, subject to Government approval, to have this proposed legislation published and introduced in the Oireachtas without undue delay.  The enactment of all of the provisions set out above is intended to improve the working of the criminal justice system and will also enable Ireland to play its part in developing a common approach at international level to combat crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">Strong provisions are in place to combat anti-social behaviour and vandalism.  The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, which modernised the law in this regard.  Furthermore, because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I brought forward tough provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.  One of the provisions of the Act is to broaden the application of the temporary closure order penalty, which was originally introduced to combat under-age drinking, to cover also convictions for a series of offences, such as a licensee supplying intoxicating liquor to drunken persons and permitting disorderly conduct on the licensed premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.  It does this by providing for the closure of premises such as pubs, off licenses, late night clubs and food premises where there is disorder or noise on or close to the premises, as well as the making of exclusion orders on individuals convicted of a range of public order offences, in addition to any penalty they might receive under the 1994 Public Order Act.  The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 contains provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour. The Act empowers a senior member of the Garda Síochána to apply to the District Court by way of a civil procedure for an order which will prohibit an adult from behaving in an anti-social manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">The relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 will be commenced following consultations between my Department, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána. These consultations are currently ongoing. The purpose of this is to ensure that these provisions will commence as soon as the Commissioner has made the necessary internal arrangements to ensure the smooth introduction of these new procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">Separate provision is being made in relation to young people.  The Act introduces provisions for behaviour orders for children aged 12 to 18 years into the Children Act, 2001 and the protections of that Act will apply.  There will be a series of incremental stages, with parental involvement, preceding an application for a behaviour order.  These include a warning, a good behaviour contract and referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme. Only after these stages can a behaviour order be sought through the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2165">I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána has a pro-active approach to policing anti-social/public disorder issues by immediate intervention, arrest and prosecutions or advice, as appropriate. Local Garda management  provide for this in policing plans and make every effort to provide a highly visible police presence on the streets of our towns and villages through the deployment of uniform Gardaí, detective units, divisional traffic corps, community policing units and mountain bike units as appropriate. Garda patrols pay particular attention to areas where the public tends to congregate such as licensed venues and fast food outlets while awaiting transport, so as to prevent and detect incidents of public disorder.  I am further informed that Operation Encounter, which was introduced by Garda management in 2002, targets public disorder offences including assaults and drinking by underage persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_2166">Juvenile Liaison Officers regularly visit schools, youth clubs and social services to give presentations under the education programme and highlight alternative options for regular offenders. Community Gardaí and the Garda Schools Liaison Officers also visit schools and address young people on a variety of topics including anti social behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_2167">Members of An Garda Síochána are frequently in contact with other Government and non-government agencies, including the Health Service Executive and the local authorities in order to have a multi-agency approach to addressing criminal issues. This multi-agency liaison will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2168">Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved (or further involved) in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development and promote civic responsibility.  The Garda Youth Diversion Projects are funded by my Department and administered through Garda Community Relations Section of An Garda Síochána.  The allocation of funding for the 74 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (along with 7 Local Drug Task Force Projects) in 2006 is just over €6.6 million, which is an increase of €1.2 million on 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">It is my intention to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007.  As part of this expansion, ten new projects were established this year and they are located in Blanchardstown, Birr, Carlow, Castlebar, Cavan, Clondalkin, Limerick, Tallaght and Tralee (two projects).</p>

            <p eId="para_2173">The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 2006 were made by the Minister for Children, Mr Brian Lenihan, T.D., on 29 September, 2006.  These Regulations will come into operation on 2 January, 2007.  Sections 8(2)(c) and 8(2)(d) of the Regulations provide that (i) a person carrying on a pre-school service shall ensure appropriate vetting of all staff, students and volunteers who have access to a child by acquiring Garda vetting from the Garda Síochána when the latter has set down procedures to make such vetting available and (ii) in circumstances where Garda vetting is not available for staff, students and volunteers who have lived outside the jurisdiction, by ensuring that these persons provide the necessary police vetting from other police authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2174">The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU), which is responsible for providing child protection vetting, is currently well advanced in the ongoing, phased expansion of its vetting service to all personnel working in a full-time, part-time and/or voluntary capacity with children and vulnerable adults.  To facilitate this, staffing of the GCVU has already been more than doubled, from 13 to 30.  In line with the current expansion programme of the GCVU and in the context of the aforementioned Regulations, it is expected that vetting will be expanded to the pre-school sector in early 2007.  Existing staffing levels at the GCVU are adequate to meet existing and foreseeable demand, although this will be subject to continuing review as expansion proceeds.</p>

            <p eId="para_2213">I have also been informed that the Fermoy District forms part of the Cork North Division. The personnel strength (all ranks) of the Cork North Division as at 31 December, 1997 and 1 November, 2006 was 208 and 258, respectively, representing an increase of 50 (or 24%) in the number of personnel allocated to the Division during that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2214">In addition, I would point out to the Deputy that the Division's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.</p>
            <p eId="para_2215">It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_2216">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Fermoy District will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_2228">Amendments to the Children Act 2001 included in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 extend the children detention school model to all offenders under the age of 18 and transfer responsibility for the detention of young people to the remit of my Department from that of my colleague the Minister for Education and Science.  This role in my Department is managed by a new executive office, the Irish Youth Justice Service, which operates within the policy parameters of the Office of the Minister for Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">It has been agreed by my colleague the Minister for Children and myself, that the existing accommodation and other facilities at the Oberstown campus need to be replaced. In addition, the accommodation requirements of children aged 16 and 17 years within a children detention school model need to be met.  In order to plan for these developments an Expert Group was set up.  This Group is considering a range of issues including location of a national centre, capacity requirements and suitable infrastructure for care and education programmes.  The Expert Group is expected to make an interim report to myself and the Minister for Children by the end of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2249">As regards liability to stamp duty, in normal circumstances where property is transferred upon death no stamp duty is liable.  However, if the transfer in question from uncle to nephew was by way of gift, stamp duty liability may arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2250">Stamp duty relief is available on the transfer of farm lands by way of gift or sale, where the farmer receiving the land is aged under 35 years and has attained relevant educational qualifications.  The required qualifications are listed in the Revenue Commissioners leaflet SD2A, which is available on their website.  The relief is intended to encourage the transfer of land to young farmers who have successfully undergone agricultural training.  If the individual in question meets the educational qualifications under this scheme he may qualify for stamp duty relief.  Where the individual in question does not qualify for young trained farmer stamp duty relief, and where the farm is transferred to him by a relative, he may qualify for a 50% relief on the stamp duty otherwise chargeable, as a relative of the person transferring the land.</p>
            <p eId="para_2251">Favourite niece/nephew relief is a Capital Acquisitions Tax relief that is available to certain nephews and nieces who take a gift or an inheritance of a business or farm from a disponer.  In order to qualify for the relief, the beneficiary must be a child of a brother or sister of the disponer (in other words, a nephew/niece in law will not qualify) and he/she must have worked substantially on a full-time basis for the disponer for a minimum of five years ending on the date of the gift or inheritance.  This relief is intended to take account of the close working relationship that exists between certain nieces/nephews and their uncles/aunts and is not intended to apply generally to all gifts or inheritances taken by nieces/nephews.</p>

            <p eId="para_2254">I would add that local authorities are treated as exempt bodies for VAT purposes.

            <p eId="para_2317">The position is that application of VAT to goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The method through which VAT must be calculated has been transposed under section 10 of the Value Added Tax Act 1972 (as amended) on the following basis; ". . . the total consideration which the person supplying goods or services becomes entitled to receive in respect of or in relation to such supply of goods or services, including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges whatsoever, but not including value-added tax chargeable in respect of the supply".  Any standing charges included in utility bills are therefore legally subject to VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2318">In relation to the scope under EU law for Member States to vary the rate of VAT applied to utilities such as gas and electricity, the position is that under the Sixth VAT Directive Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services, which have been in place since 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to other goods and services. The supply of fuel and energy products used for home heating and light are already subject to the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% under Article 28 (2e) of the Sixth VAT Directive. This means that Member States had the option of maintaining, at a reduced rate of not less than 12%, any items not listed in Annex H of the Sixth VAT Directive, provided these items carried a reduced rate on 1 January 1991. Ireland is one of only eight Member States that apply a reduced or parked rate to the supply of fuel and energy products used for home heating and light. In Ireland the parked VAT rate equates to our reduced rate of 13.5%. Telecommunications are subject to the Standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.</p>

            <p eId="para_2338">There are already generous incentives for taxpayers investing in pensions.  In addition, the Pensions Incentive Tax Credits Scheme, introduced in the 2006 Finance Act, provides an incentive for eligible SSIA holders on lower incomes to reinvest all or part of their net SSIA proceeds, after maturity, into an approved pension product, including a PRSA.  It is primarily a savings scheme and is designed for people who are saving for retirement.  The incentive involves a tax credit of €1 for every €3 of SSIA proceeds reinvested, up to a maximum of €2,500 credit (i.e. €7,500 invested).  Secondly, there is an additional tax credit involving a percentage of the tax deducted from the SSIA on maturity.  Where an SSIA holder avails of the Pensions Incentive Tax Credits Scheme, it is not possible to claim any other tax relief for amounts invested up to and including €7,500.  Tax relief can be claimed, however, on amounts in excess of €7,500 transferred from a matured SSIA to an approved pension product, subject to the standard limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">If a person invests SSIA proceeds in a pension product without availing of the Pensions Incentive Tax Credits Scheme, he/she can claim tax relief in respect of that investment subject to the standard limits.</p>

            <p eId="para_2341">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to furnish figures of the VAT paid by charities and non-profit organisations on their purchases of goods and services from VAT registered bodies, as the information furnished on VAT returns does not require the yield from particular consumers to be identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_2342">In relation to the application of VAT to charities and non-profit organisations, the position is that charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase.  Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2343">Ministerial Orders have been used in a limited way to provide refunds of VAT on certain aids and appliances for the disabled and on medical equipment donated voluntarily to hospitals.  These orders are focused and are designed to target specific circumstances.  However, under EU law, it would not be possible to introduce new schemes within the VAT Act 1972 to relieve charities from the obligation to pay VAT on goods and services that they purchase.</p>
            <p eId="para_2344">I would add that the tax code currently provides exemption for charities from Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax, Stamp Duty, Probate Tax and Dividend Withholding Tax.  Moreover, charities also benefit significantly from the uniform scheme of tax relief for donations, which was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and which, for the first time, allowed tax relief on personal donations to domestic charities and other approved bodies.  The relief is based on the taxpayer's marginal rate which for an individual donor could be as high as 42%.  In the case of donations from the PAYE sector the relief is given directly to the charities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2346">I assume the Deputy is referring to proposals to amend the stamp duty code in the forthcoming Budget.  I further assume the Deputy is seeking the cost of exempting sporting bodies from stamp duty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2347">As the Deputy is aware, I do not comment on possible changes ahead of the Budget.  I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are unable to provide a cost of introducing an exemption from stamp duty for sporting bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2348">The Deputy will already be aware of the fact that an exemption from stamp duty is provided for in the stamp duty code in respect of a conveyance, transfer or lease of land made for charitable purposes to a body of persons established for charitable purposes only.  This exemption is confined to bodies of persons which are recognised under law as having been established for charitable purposes only in which case the entirety of the activities carried on by the body in question must be charitable in nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_2349">In this regard, voluntary sporting bodies that do not have this charitable exemption are liable to stamp duty in the normal manner.  However, there are separate relieving provisions in the tax code for not-for-profit and member-controlled sporting bodies.  Amateur and athletic associations are not liable to income tax.  In addition, a generous capital gains tax exemption is available to sports bodies where they dispose of a property and the proceeds are re-invested in new assets for the promotion of the sport in question.  In this situation, capital gains tax is not payable.  In addition, sporting organisations can avail of the special donations scheme.  Where donations are made to qualifying sporting associations, the Revenue Commissioners will apply relief on the donation at the donor's marginal tax rate and refund the relief to the sports body in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_2351">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the net yield from DIRT collected in 2005 was €167 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">The amount of DIRT due to be paid each year is dependent on the amount of monies on deposit and the rates of interest applying to such deposits rather than on the number of accounts involved.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the statutory return of DIRT filed by the financial institutions requires details only of the relevant amount of interest paid in the year and the appropriate tax in relation to the payment of that interest.  There is, therefore, no basis for compiling the information requested in relation to the number of accounts, either by reference to all account holders or to those aged over 65 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2353">A refund of deposit interest retention tax is provided for where an individual is not liable or fully liable to income tax and is over 65 years of age at some time during the tax year or is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental/physical infirmity from maintaining himself or herself. (Bodies qualifying for ‘charitable' status and companies are also entitled to refund of DIRT).  The taxpayer must advise Revenue that he or she meets the legislative requirements and the amount of the retention tax suffered.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the total amount of DIRT repaid in 2005 was €2.3 million and the number of such repayments was 971.  With deposit interest rates being very low in recent years, the quantum of the interest earned and tax retained would be very small in many cases and may be considered uneconomic to reclaim.</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">As regards the cost of applying DIRT only to deposit interest which exceeds the rate of inflation, it is not possible to provide a costing due to the multiplicity of rates that are offered by Financial Institutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_2447">I propose to take Questions Nos. 283 to 286, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2448">The National Development Plan/Community Support Framework (NDP/CSF) 2000-2006 is implemented through seven Operational Programmes (OPs).  The most recent expenditure data reported to the Operational Programmes Monitoring Committees at their Autumn 2006 meetings held during week beginning 23rd October relates to the period January 2000 to the end June 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2449">In comparing the expenditure versus original profile, it is important to note that significant expenditure, particularly Exchequer expenditure, takes place in the latter half of the year.  The position will become clearer when data is available for the full calendar year at the Spring 2007 Monitoring Committees scheduled to take place in April 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2450">The House will be aware of the general state of play in relation to expenditure in the BMW region from previous debates and questions on this issue.  The figures reported at the recent Monitoring Committee meetings indicate that some €13.2 billion or 78% of the total original forecast for expenditure (Exchequer, EU and private) and €11.1 billion or 82% of forecast Exchequer expenditure had been incurred by the end of June 2006.  This is a healthy implementation rate in view of the slow start up in some areas at the very beginning, the relatively disappointing response in certain demand led schemes and the fact that Exchequer spending in relation to the Structural Fund OPs for the 2000-2006 period will in fact continue up to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2451">With regard to the Southern and Eastern (S&amp;E) region, the figures reported indicate that some €35.1 billion or 97% of the total original forecast for expenditure (Exchequer, EU and private) and €30.2 billion or 108% of forecast Exchequer expenditure had been incurred in the S&amp;E region by the end of June 2006.  This means that the Exchequer contribution to the S&amp;E region under the NDP had already exceeded its original target by €2.28 billion to the end of June 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_2454">The wall on the right bank of the River Tolka, downstream of Distillery Road Bridge has been assessed and raised in any areas where the levels were under the prediction level of a 100 year flood, i.e. a flood with a 1% probability of occurring in a given year, thereby giving each side of the river protection against the design extreme event.  Parts of the new wall on the left bank may be higher in places but this would be only to ensure the wall is at a minimum safety height from the road side.</p>

            <p eId="para_2460">I propose to take Questions Nos. 289, 290 and 300 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2461">Firstly I wish to confirm that the Study in question was formulated following wide ranging consultation and following completion of the report recently, a number of presentations on the Study were held for a number of interested parties including local elected representatives, local residents and statutory authorities.  Consultation is currently ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2462">Options to resolve the severe traffic hazards at both the Ashtown and Cabra gates have been thoroughly investigated over an extended period in full consultation with the relevant authorities and I am satisfied that the option of a one way system for the Ashtown and Cabra gates represents the optimum solution.  This solution has been endorsed by the independent Traffic Management Study recently completed and a similar system is proposed for Chapelizod and Islandbridge gates.  As verified by the Traffic Management Study, the impacts of the one-way system on Blackhorse Avenue will be relatively minor.  Consequently, while it is understandable that local residents have concerns about impacts on the area, in reality these concerns are largely unfounded.  In light of the findings of the Traffic Management Study the deputy will appreciate that there is now an onus on the Commissioners to proceed with implementation of the measures contained therein, in the interests of the safety of all Park users and conservation of the Park and its amenities.  I wish to confirm also that the Commissioners will monitor and review the effectiveness of these measures, following implementation, including of course the proposed one-way systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_2463">The fee for the Faber Maunsell Study, including services provided by ERM, amounts to €42,043.86 (including VAT) which has been paid.  The provision of cost estimates for implementation of the measures did not form part of the commission.  The main cost element will be the measures proposed for the Chesterfield Avenue.  Implementation of the measures will be subject to standard procurement procedures and the Commissioners are anxious to ensure that this process is not prejudiced in any way.  The Commissioners will be in a position to confirm the costs once the procurement process, in each instance, has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2464">Messrs. Faber Maunsell engaged Messrs. ERM to vet the proposed measures contained in the Study from an environmental perspective and the findings are incorporated in the Study.  Section 5.3 and Table 5.1 of the Study deals with the assessment of the proposals.  The Commissioners do not have a separate report from Messrs. ERM.</p>

            <p eId="para_2466">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the purposes of both Gift and Inheritance Tax, the relationship between the person who provided the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who received the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum tax-free threshold-known as the "Group threshold". Three Group thresholds are based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer and are indexed annually by reference to the Consumer Price Index. The following are the Group thresholds for 2006: Group A: €478,155 — applies where the beneficiary is a child (including certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance from a child. Group B: €47,815 — applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, niece, nephew, or lineal descendant of the disponer. Group C: €23,908 — applies in all other cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2467">Where both Capital Gains Tax and Capital Acquisitions Tax (Gift or Inheritance Tax) arise on the same asset on the same event, for example, on a gift of an asset, the Capital Gains Tax can be off-set or credited against the Capital Acquisitions Tax liability.  From 21 February 2006, if the asset is disposed of within 2 years of the date of the gift, the off-set or credit allowed will be clawed back.</p>

            <p eId="para_2514">Regulatory inspections are the responsibility of the Registrar of Credit Unions. The Registrar of Credit Unions is statutorily independent of me in performing his regulatory functions. On foot of the outcome of any regulatory investigations the Registrar can take whatever steps he considers necessary to resolve any issues using the powers available to him.</p>
            <p eId="para_2515">In relation to credit union legislation, the Credit Union Act, 1997 provides the legal framework for the regulation of credit unions. The Act was designed to provide the credit union movement with a regulatory structure that reflects and promotes the particular ethos and philosophy of the credit union movement, its strong tradition of volunteer service and the core objective of providing opportunities for saving and lending for members of credit unions.  The approach to regulation embodied in the Credit Union Act has served the credit union movement well by providing clarity and certainty to individual credit unions, their Directors and members. It has helped support the continued stability of the credit union movement and to safeguard members' savings during a period of rapid growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_2516">As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions continues to be appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. In recent months, I have introduced a regulation to increase the maximum amount a member of a credit union can hold in shares and deposits. Furthermore, the Registrar of Credit Unions recently issued guidelines on a revised framework for prudent and responsible investment by credit unions. Other developments include the establishment of a review group chaired by my Department to examine the current limits on longer-term lending in Section 35 of the Credit Union Act, and the agreement by the Financial Regulator to examine proposals for reform of the Savings Protection Scheme with a view to approving the scheme under Section 46 of the Credit Union Act 1997 to strengthen the protection afforded to credit union savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2517">I believe it would be helpful if there was a clearer, and if possible shared, understanding on how a new regulatory framework would operate before moving to develop specific proposals. The Chair of the Regulatory Authority has recently confirmed that the Registrar of Credit Unions will engage with the credit union movement, in the first instance, to find common ground in relation to the principles that might guide the reform of the regulatory framework for credit unions.</p>

As staff who have applied to decentralise continue to be transferred into decentralising organisations, the posts they vacate become available to those wishing to remain in Dublin.  Further arrangements have been initiated for general service grades. The objective of these arrangements is to provide to the Public Appointments Service (PAS) details of staff who wish to remain in Dublin at each grade level so that a proportion of vacancies arising in Dublin based posts may be filled by those staff.

            <p eId="para_2586">I am aware of the proposal mentioned by the Deputy.  The position is that expenses in respect of tuition for children with dyslexia do not qualify for health expenses tax relief and have never qualified for the relief since it was first introduced in 1967.  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners, who deal with such claims, that individuals may have been under the impression that tuition for children with dyslexia was allowable under the heading of health expenses relief. I also understand that the Revenue Commissioners have written to the Dyslexia Association to clarify the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2587">In recent years, the Government has increased significantly the supports available through the direct expenditure system for children with disabilities, including those with dyslexia.  As with many areas where State support may be required, the question arises as to whether such support may be more effectively provided through the direct expenditure route rather than through the tax system.  One advantage of the former mechanism is that the support may be better targeted at those in need, irrespective of family income, whereas support through the tax system can only benefit those whose incomes are high enough to benefit from tax relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_2588">As I have indicated to the House already in this matter, I have no plans to extend Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to cover expenses incurred by parents who have children with dyslexia.  However, this matter, like any other, can be raised by the Deputy at Finance Bill time.</p>

            <p eId="para_2595">I would make the following comments in relation to the tax on approved retirement funds, ARF.  The 2006 Budget and Finance Act introduced an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets of an ARF on 31 December each year, which notional amount will be taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate.  The change is being phased in over a 3 year period commencing next year.  This measure was introduced because the internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners last year, and which was published earlier this year, found that the ARF option was largely not being used, as intended, to fund an income stream in retirement but instead was being used to build up substantial funds in a tax-free environment over the long term.  The imputed distribution measure will encourage the use of ARFs as intended, as funds actually drawn down by ARF owners will be credited against the imputed distribution to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any.  It is important to note that ARF owners on lower incomes and who qualify for the higher income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 or over may not be affected at all by the measure.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2613">The Government has brought in a number of measures, both on the supply side and the demand side, to deal with the growing demand for child care, which has been created by the economic and social changes which have taken place over the last decade.  These measures are aimed at supporting parents with the cost of child care and increasing the supply of quality child care places available to parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_2614">The primary supply side measure of the Government's approach to ensuring the provision of affordable child care has been to stimulate the provision of quality child care places, through the provision of grants for the child care sector.  This is being done through the equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, 2000-2006 and the national child care investment programme, NCIP, 2006-2010.  These programmes, with a combined budget of over €1 billion, are projected to create or support over 90,000 child care places, with some 29,000 of the new places already in place.  These places are provided either through community based/not for profit child care groups or by private providers.  Of the total funding committed in the period from the start of the EOCP to August 2006, over €67 million has been allocated to quality improvement and over €484 million to child care facilities, of which almost €183 million has been allocated to staffing grant assistance.  This provides support towards the staffing costs of employing child care workers in community based child care centres in disadvantaged areas, ensuring that less advantaged parents in those areas have increased access to quality child care and that they are charged fees which are less than the economic cost of providing the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2615">On the demand side, government policy to support parents with the cost of child care has been to increase child benefit payments and introduce the early child care supplement, ECS.  Both instruments support all parents irrespective of income or employment status.  Child benefit has been increased in successive budgets and in Budget 2006, it was increased by €8.40 per month for the first two children to €150 per month; and by €7.70 per month for the third and subsequent children to €185 per month.  This means that over the period since 1997 child benefit has more than quadrupled.</p>
            <p eId="para_2616">The early child care supplement of €1,000 per annum was introduced for all children less than six years of age and became effective in April 2006.  This is a direct, non-taxable payment of €250 per quarter year, in respect of each eligible child.  There have already been two payments of the ECS in August and October, and I expect the final payment of €250 to be paid on 11 December.  From 2007 the payments will be made in April, July, October and December.  Taken together these payments mean that a family with two children under the age of six years are now in receipt of a direct payment per annum of €5,800.</p>
            <p eId="para_2617">The levels of increase in child benefit and the introduction of the early child care supplement is unprecedented and delivers on the Government's objective of providing support for children generally while offering real choice to all parents in relation to the care of their children.  I am satisfied that the EOCP and NCIP will serve to moderate prices in the sector over time by increasing the supply of places and giving parents greater choice.  This Government's record in providing enhanced child care supports is without parallel and I am confident that we are moving rapidly to ensure that there are quality services available to parents throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_2624">By any standards the HSE is a very large organisation with total staffing of around 120,000 and a budget of over €12 billion.  Such an organisation cannot function without sophisticated ICT systems.  These systems need to cover areas such as personnel, payroll, purchasing and accounts.  I acknowledge that there has been some public concern in relation to some of these systems in the HSE and with PPARS in particular.  I am anxious to improve the governance of ICT within the Health Service Executive and I have written to the Chairman asking him to ensure that the matter is resolved as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2625">Apart from these business applications ICT has the potential to make hospitals and other health service settings safer and more efficient.  It also makes health services management and delivery more efficient and effective.  In my view ICT alone will not achieve this but it cannot be achieved without ICT.  The over-riding purpose of ICT in health care should be the bringing of information to the point where it is required to support decision making and the most effective and reliable means of collecting health information is to generate it as a by-product of other health related processes, be they clinical or administrative.</p>
            <p eId="para_2626">Some concerns have been expressed about the confidentiality of electronic health records but ICT can increase the privacy and confidentiality of patients records by controlling and tracking who has access to them.  One of the key issues in modern health care can be the availability of key critical information to the doctor at the point of care and sophisticated ICT systems are required to provide this.  I do acknowledge that developing, implementing and using electronic patient records is a slow and complex process but the benefits can be considerable, especially in terms of reducing errors and improving the quality of care.</p>

            <p eId="para_2641">As the Deputy may be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993  provide for the payment of subvention for private nursing home care for applicants who qualify on both medical and means grounds.  General rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for nursing home subvention are set out in the Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993, as amended by the Nursing Homes (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2642">Under the Regulations, when considering an application for subvention, the Health Service Executive carries out a means test which takes into account the means (including assets) of the applicant and his or her spouse/cohabiting partner, where appropriate.  The HSE may impute an income of 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of an applicant for subvention, unless the residence is occupied by a spouse or son or daughter aged less than twenty one years or in full time education or in receipt of certain social welfare pension/allowances and generally does so unless there are exceptional circumstances. The Regulations provide that the HSE may refuse to pay a subvention if the value of the applicant's principal residence is in excess of €500,000 (where the residence is located in the Dublin area) or €300,000 (where the residence is located outside the Dublin area) and the applicant has an income of at least €9,000 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_2643">The Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Bill 2006 which is currently on its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, is designed to ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing home care is grounded in primary legislation and to help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis across the country. In addition, national guidelines on nursing home subvention are currently being developed by the HSE to ensure an even and equitable application of the regulations nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2644">The Government is currently considering new policy on Long Term Care and several principles underlying this were agreed with the social partners in "Towards 2016".  These principles include, for example, that there should be one standardised national needs assessment for older people needing care.  The use of community and home-based care should be maximised.  Sheltered housing options will be encouraged.  Where residential care is required, it should be quality care and there should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  The level of support for residential care should be indifferent as to whether that care is in a public or private facility. The financial model to support any new arrangements must also be financially sustainable. The Department is currently drawing up proposals in this regard as agreed with the social partners in "Towards 2016".</p>

            <p eId="para_2646">I take it the question refers to the charging of people in long stay care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2647">The charging for long stay care under the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005 is being implemented by way of the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005.  These Regulations were signed on 14 June 2005 and reinstated charges for in-patient services and provided for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of in-patient services. The Regulations were prepared following extensive consultation with the HSE and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_2648">Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, (as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005) provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the levying of a charge where in-patient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months.  In this regard, charging of patients in long-term care commenced on 14 July 2005, which was after the expiration of 30 days after the Regulations were signed.  The Regulations, in keeping with Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied.</p>
            <p eId="para_2649">Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of €120 or the weekly income of that person less €35, whichever is the lesser.  Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of €90, or the weekly income of that person less €55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</p>
            <p eId="para_2650">These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person.  The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of "undue hardship". Under Section 1 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person's overall financial situation in view of the person's reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any.</p>
            <p eId="para_2651">The mechanism for levying and collecting charges in respect of patients in receipt of social welfare pensions and also in respect of patients who are adult dependants on the social welfare pension of their spouse, is an operational matter for the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_2666">The Commission conducted an intensive and analytical examination of AHR issues, and its conclusions derive from this wide research.

The Commission's report was published in May last year and the Government decided to refer the report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  This process was intended to allow for further consideration of the complex issues involved and the Committee's report, along with the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, will help to inform future policy in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2707">I propose to take Questions Nos. 348, 349, 365, 366 and 385 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2708">The implementation of the recommendations in the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, "A Vision for Change" will be a matter primarily for the Health Service Executive in accordance with the provisions of the Health Act, 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2709">The Report, which has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of our mental health services, outlines a vision of the future for mental health services and sets out a framework for action to achieve it over the next 7-10 years.  An additional €26.2 million was made available this year to the Health Service Executive for the further development of our mental health services, bringing the total revenue spend to approximately €835m in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2710">I acknowledge that significant capital investment is required to provide and equip the proposed new mental health infrastructure.  "A Vision for Change" estimates that approximately €800m will be required.  However, there are substantial capital assets tied up in the existing psychiatric hospital buildings and lands which could be used productively to expand and modernise our mental health services.  The Report recommends that the full economic value of such hospital buildings and lands within the mental health services be assessed and valued.  The value of these assets should significantly counterbalance the projected capital cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_2711">In March 2006, I appointed an independent monitoring group to monitor progress on the implementation of all the recommendations in "A Vision for Change".  In addition, the Health Service Executive recently established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in "A Vision for Change" a reality.  Both of these Groups will play an important role in ensuring that the recommendations are implemented in a co-ordinated and timely manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2712">"A Vision for Change" highlights the importance of mental health promotion in the prevention of mental health problems through the development of coping and problem-solving skills, help-seeking and resilience.  It also recommends that mental health promotion should be available for all age groups, to enhance the protective factors and decrease risk factors for developing mental health problems.  The Health Service Executive now has responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, including health promotion programme development and implementation and will be guided by national policy in the development of mental health promotion programmes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2734">I presume the Deputy is referring to the National Standards for Disability Services (NSDS), which my Department has developed in partnership with the National Disability Authority (NDA) in consultation with people with disabilities, their families, carers, service providers, health services providers and other stakeholders.  These standards are designed to ensure that services are provided to an agreed level of quality and that the level of quality is consistent on a national basis. It is proposed that the standards will apply to a range of services for people with disabilities as funded by the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2735">The draft NSDS are being considered within the framework of the Health Services Reform Programme. A critical element in this process is the establishment of the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA).  The new Health Bill currently being drafted to underpin the Health Reform Programme will include provision for the establishment of HIQA on a statutory basis.  The establishment of HIQA as a key part of the architecture of planning and developing health and personal social services in Ireland will promote a continuous quality improvement ethos in the health system.   The development and implementation of the NSDS is a central element of the process.  Meanwhile, the draft NSDS have been forwarded to the interim HIQA for its consideration.  The implementation process for the NSDS will necessarily involve an incremental process of planning, training and implementation over the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_2739">The Deputy will be aware that, in Budget 2006, an investment package of €150 million was announced for additional services for Older People and Palliative Care.  This package included €55 million for the rolling out of 2,000 additional Home Care Packages.  €30 million of this was for 2006, with the remaining €25m for 2007. Of this €30 million, a total of €3.6 million was allocated to the former Northern Area Health Board area, based on the percentage of the population aged over 65.</p>
            <p eId="para_2740">Home Care Packages are delivered through the HSE and consist of a mixture of grants, contracted care services, therapeutic input, equipment and other such community services as determined by a needs assessment to facilitate an older person to remain living in their own home. They vary according to the care needs of the person so that, for example, there might be a greater emphasis in some packages on home care assistance while other packages may require a greater level of therapy and nursing.</p>

            <p eId="para_3090">Ensuring an adequate supply of nurses and midwives has been a concern of this Government for some time, and a number of substantial measures have been introduced in recent years. The annual number of undergraduate nursing training places has been increased by 94% since 1998 to 1,880 places from 2006 onwards.  There are over 6,000 students in the system at any one time.  Revenue funding for the undergraduate training programme is €115m per annum and the Government has provided €250m capital funding since 2002 to build thirteen new schools of nursing.  The first cohort of students from the new four year degree programme graduated and registered as nurses earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3091">The measures to increase the domestic supply of nurses and midwives are vital to ensuring we have an adequate workforce to meet the needs of the health service going forward.  It is expected that the nursing students funded by the Government will meet much of the demand for nurses in coming years.  The Government has been successful in recruiting an additional 10,200 nurses (whole time equivalents) into the public health service over the last nine years.  It is the responsibility of the HSE to effectively manage the nursing resource.  In addition to training additional nurses it is also important that work systems are constantly monitored and adapted to ensure the best outcomes for patients.  The increased use of health care assistants and better skill mix will help to ensure that our nursing care teams will continue to be able to deal with the growing demands on the health service.  It has to be recognised that health professionals operate within a global labour market and that careers in the Irish public health service will also prove attractive to overseas nurses from EU and non-EU countries alike.</p>
            <p eId="para_3092">I am confident that the extensive range of measures to increase the domestic supply of nurses together with the more effective utilisation of the professional skills of nurses and midwives and the recruitment of overseas nurses, in addition to close monitoring and assessment of the situation on an ongoing basis, will continue to prove effective in addressing the nursing workforce needs of the health services.</p>

            <p eId="para_3100">I propose to take Questions Nos. 423 to 425, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3101">The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects data on MRSA bacteraemia (also known as bloodstream infection or ‘blood poisoning') as part of the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS).  EARSS collects data on the first episode of blood stream infection per patient per quarter.  The Irish data for EARSS, which is published on a quarterly basis by the HPSC, showed that there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 586 cases in 2006 and 285 reported cases in the first half of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3102">It is difficult to identify the number of fatalities attributable to MRSA as many people also have significant co-morbidity factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3103">This year, Ireland participated in the Hospital Infection Society's "Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections" (HCAIs) in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The survey provided accurate and comparable data on the prevalence of HCAIs (including MRSA) in acute hospitals in Ireland and can also be compared with similar data being obtained in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Preliminary results of this study are now available.  The overall prevalence of health-care associated infection in the UK and Ireland (these figures exclude Scotland) is 7.9%.  The England figure is 8.2%, Wales 6.3%, Northern Ireland 5.5% and the Republic of Ireland 4.9%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3104">As expected, the prevalence of health-care associated infection was highest in regional/tertiary hospitals at 6% and lowest in specialist hospitals at 2%. 10% of patients with a health-care associated infection in the Republic of Ireland were recorded as having an MRSA related health-care infection.  This is lower than the UK average of 16%. While the overall prevalence is lower in Ireland than UK, further analysis needs to be done before the true implications of this survey become clear.</p>
            <p eId="para_3105">Measures to control the emergence and spread of HCAIs are necessary because there are fewer options available for the treatment of resistant infections and because these strains spread amongst vulnerable at-risk patients.  The prudent use of antibiotics underpins any approach to the control of antibiotic resistant bacteria, including MRSA.  This, together with good professional practice and routine infection control precautions, such as hand hygiene, constitute the major measures in controlling and preventing health care associated infection, including that caused by MRSA, both in hospital and in community health care units.</p>
            <p eId="para_3106">A strategy for the control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland (SARI) was launched in 2001 and includes recommendations such as hospital hygiene practice, appropriate antibiotic prescribing, active surveillance for the detection of MRSA and corporate/ clinical governance structures in the area of infection control.  At present, active recruitment is ongoing within the HSE nationally to employ essential infection control staff such as infection control nurses, hospital liaison pharmacists, surveillance scientists and clinical microbiologists.  The HSE are shortly to publish a three year Action Plan which will set targets in this important area.</p>

            <p eId="para_3123">It is a matter for the Health Service Executive, as part of its management of its employment ceiling, to determine the appropriate staffing mix required to deliver its service plan priorities. I have consistently emphasised the importance of prioritising the filling of front line vacancies in complying with approved employment levels. I have also emphasised the need to achieve an appropriate balance between clinical and non-clinical posts, which is a matter for the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_3124">Approved employment levels for the health service have been adjusted since 2002 in line with Government policy on public sector employment and also to take account of specific policy measures aimed at increasing service levels.  Following discussions with the Health Service Executive, my Department has submitted proposals to the Department of Finance seeking a revision to the health service employment ceiling.  This revision has been sought in light of approved service developments during 2005 and 2006 and to reflect a more inclusive methodology in the collection of health service personnel census information.  A decision in this regard is awaited from the Department of Finance and as deliberations are on-going it would not be appropriate to disclose specific information in regard to staff ceiling revisions identified.</p>

These have also been highlighted in the EU Green Paper on energy policy, ‘A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy'.

            <p eId="para_3143">While I am aware of the falling productivity and slowing growth rates in the area the Deputy refers to, the shellfish sector in general has performed consistently well in the context of Irish aquaculture.</p>
            <p eId="para_3144">To ensure the continuation of this success, the Department is taking action in a number of areas.  I have asked An Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) together with the Marine Institute (MI) and in consultation with the Irish Shellfish Association (ISA), to undertake a Carrying Capacity study of bay areas in Ireland with regard to shellfish aquaculture. Killary Bay has been prioritised as the pilot location for this study. BIM and the MI are working closely with the CLAMS (Coordinated Local Aquaculture Management Systems) group in the area in order to identify any obstacles at local level that may be impacting on the sector's development, and make recommendations on how to improve performance of operators in Killary Bay.</p>
            <p eId="para_3145">I also asked BIM together with Enterprise Ireland to review the Rope Mussel industry. The report was prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers and involved extensive consultation with industry. I consider that the report offers a very good blueprint for this sector. The implementation of the report's key recommendations will take time to bear fruit and it is important now to work with all involved to deliver on this report. These steps are essential to ensure the continued viability and the sustainable development of this mussel industry into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_3147">Legislation exists to tackle the issue to which the Deputy refers:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3148">It is an offence under Section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act, 1951, as amended by The Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, to send by phone any message or other matter, which is grossly offensive, or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3149">It is also an offence under Section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, to harass a person by use of any means including by use of a telephone; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3150">The sending of child pornographic images via phone is covered by the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, and this Act provides for an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years for anyone to knowingly produce, distribute, print, publish, import, export, sell, or show child pornography. Mere possession of child pornography can attract a penalty of five years imprisonment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3151">Anyone who has information in relation to these matters should bring it immediately to the attention of the Garda Síochána for criminal investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3152">The idea for a Register of mobile phones was extensively reviewed by my officials. There were many complex legal, technical, data protection and practical issues to be considered. In theory, a Register of mobile phones might seem like a good idea. However, having looked at the situation in other administrations, considered the ease with which an unregistered foreign or stolen SIM card can be used and the difficulties that would be posed in verifying identity in the absence of a national identification card system, and having consulted with the Office of the Attorney General and other interested parties, it was concluded that the proposal would be of limited benefit in that it would not solve the illegal and inappropriate use of pre-paid mobile phones and was not practical.</p>
            <p eId="para_3153">As Minister I continue to support the mobile industry in their work on the safe and responsible use of mobile phones. The Irish Cellular Industry Association (ICIA), has taken many steps in this regard, including the promotion of public awareness, exploring the benefits of content filtering software, the launch of a Parents Guide and a Code of Practice, which represents the minimum set of standards to which they will adhere for the responsible and secure use of mobile phones.</p>

The EPAs are first and foremost instruments for development that are intended to foster the smooth and gradual integration of the ACP States into the world economy, thereby promoting sustainable development and contributing to poverty eradication.</p>
            <p eId="para_3172">The establishment of a monitoring mechanism to track key development benchmarks of the EPA process was first announced by Commissioner Mandelson in January 2005. At the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in Brussels in November 2005, which I attended, Member States further pledged to "establish and implement an improved monitoring mechanism against development objectives within the EPA process".</p>
            <p eId="para_3173">This commitment was reinforced by Ministers for Foreign Affairs at the GAERC of December 2005, in the document ‘The EU and Africa: towards a strategic partnership', in which Member States undertook to "closely monitor EPAs so that they help achieve development objectives".</p>
            <p eId="para_3174">The review of the EPA negotiations, mandated by article 37.4 of the Cotonou Agreement, is now underway. I welcome the valuable opportunity this review will provide for reflection on both the process and substance of the EPA negotiations, including the question of a monitoring mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_3175">I urge all stakeholders in the EPA process to take full advantage of this review. A thorough and comprehensive evaluation is in the interests of all of us committed to a truly pro-development outcome to this process. I look forward to the results of the review, which are expected at the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3228">One of the fundamental qualification conditions for carer's allowance is that the applicant must be providing full time care and attention to a person who needs such care.  Since the introduction of the carer's allowance scheme this full time care and attention requirement has been eased in order to facilitate carers in engaging in employment, education or training.</p>
            <p eId="para_3229">Until June this year people could engage in employment outside the home for up to 10 hours per week and still qualify for payment.  Since then, I have increased the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home and still satisfy the qualifying conditions for payment, from 10 to 15 hours per week.  This improvement applies to carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_3230">Any further change in the existing arrangements would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

            <p eId="para_3241">Farm assist is a means-tested scheme providing weekly income support to low-income farmers.  For the purpose of determining the rate of farm assist payable, deductions are allowed from net income in respect of qualified children, with the balance is assessed at 70%.  In this regard, the means test is more favourable than the scheme's predecessor, the unemployment assistance scheme for small-holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_3242">In addition, income from the Rural Environment Protection Scheme is assessed separately, with the first €2,539 and 50% of the balance disregarded.  40% of net pay from insurable employment and €20,000 of capital are also disregarded.</p>
            <p eId="para_3243">Currently, 7,492 Farm Assist cases are in payment, receiving an average weekly payment of €178.79.</p>
            <p eId="para_3244">The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income, which is calculated as gross income less any expenses necessarily incurred, from farming.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  In computing income account is taken of the value of sales of milk, livestock, crops and subsidy payments such as headage payments.  All expenses actually and necessarily incurred are deducted from this.  These include the cost of fertilisers, repairs to farm building and fences, the cost of replacing farm machinery, use of hired labour other than family members, the cost of electricity and transport used for farming purposes, veterinary expenses, purchases of fodder and animal feed, rent of land, crop sprays etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_3245">The aim of the assessment is to use the previous years income to accurately reflect farm income in the following twelve months, having regard to the size and type of farm, the quality of land and taking into account any significant anticipated changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3246">In addition, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3247">The farmer is given a copy of the report on the sources of income and expenses and is also given details of how the Deciding Officer has calculated the means and how this determines the rate of Farm Assist payable.</p>
            <p eId="para_3248">In so far as tax assessments show the factual income position as required under social welfare legislation they could be used by the social welfare inspector in preparing the report.  I do not think, however that the use of tax assessments would be a reliable approach in all cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_3249">Any farmer who is dissatisfied with the rate of means assessed may apply for a review or may appeal the assessment to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_3254">The living alone increase is an additional payment of €7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_3255">It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes. The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_3256">The additional payment is primarily designed to target the increased risk of poverty that older people face if living alone though, as already indicated, it is also payable to those receiving long-term invalidity type payments in recognition of the particular difficulties faced by that group. Extending the payment to other social welfare recipients who are under 66 years of age, such as those in receipt of widow's and widower's pension, would have significant cost implications.</p>
            <p eId="para_3257">The living alone increase has not been raised since 1996 because the policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than focusing on payments such as the living alone increase. This approach ensures that resources are used to improve the position of all pensioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_3258">Any increases in the payment would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

            <p eId="para_3260">My Department has overall responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need intensive help and advice in coping with their debt problems.  The service places an emphasis on practical budget-based measures that help people to move permanently from dependence on moneylenders and to access alternative sources of low-cost credit, particularly through their local credit union. It is with the support and expertise of the MABS companies throughout the country that people can be best assisted in sorting out their debts.  MABS supplements, paid in a minority of cases by certain former health boards through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, ceased in 2003.  I have no plans to reintroduce such supplements, given the successful arrangements that are in place at MABS outlets throughout the State.  A person who is experiencing particular financial difficulties may apply to the community welfare service of the Health Services Executive for an exceptional needs payment or other form of short-term income support through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3268">The person concerned has been receiving disability allowance since April 2001. Under the legislative provisions that apply to disability allowance all income which the claimant has, subject to certain exceptions, is assessable as means.

From May 2003 maintenance payments up to €95.23 per week could be disregarded as being towards meeting housing costs and half of the balance of the maintenance assessed as means.  The person concerned was paying rent in respect of her home, but this was overlooked in reviewing her means.  Due to this oversight her means were not adjusted and she did not receive an increase in her disability allowance.  Her means have now been reviewed and she has been awarded the maximum rate of disability allowance, backdated to 7th May 2003.

            <p eId="para_3272">Supporting and recognising carers in our society has been a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  The introduction of waivers or subsidies in respect of waste charges is, as stated by my colleague the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a matter for each local authority.  Waste collection and charging arrangements vary considerably and the introduction of a national social welfare scheme to address the issue would be complex given the wide range of charging regimes and cost structures that exist.  Some local authorities already operate waiver schemes and any system put in place to assist people with waste collection charges would have to take account of the implications for the different local arrangements which currently apply.  I have asked my Department to continue to explore possible options in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_3274">To qualify for a payment under the national fuel scheme, the income of a person over age 80 must not exceed a weekly threshold of €254.30.  The weekly threshold comprises the maximum weekly rate of Social Welfare Contributory Pension of €203.30 (in this person's case) plus €51.  The person concerned reapplied for Fuel Allowance on 27 October 2006.  She has not disclosed the amount of her savings.  She has two pensions from the United States amounting to $1,600.58 which equates to $19,206.96 per annum, or $369.36 per week.  Using the appropriate conversion rate, this amounts to €289.84, which exceeds the weekly income threshold.  Accordingly, her application for Fuel Allowance has been disallowed.  The person concerned has been notified accordingly.</p>

            <p eId="para_3277">I propose to take Questions Nos. 470 and 471 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3278">Moneylending is regulated under the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  The licensing of moneylenders is a matter for the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  I am concerned about the cost and availability of credit for people on low incomes.  In June 2005, I met the Financial Regulator to discuss this issue.  As a result, the Financial Regulator initiated research with the Combat Poverty Agency to find out more about the nature and extent of financial exclusion.  The report will be available to the Financial Regulator shortly.  Officials of my Department will meet him to discuss the policy implications of the findings.  MABS was established to build new and more comprehensive approaches to combating the problems of moneylending.  My Department, in consultation with the MABS service providers, keeps the role of MABS under review to ensure it continues to strengthen its role in supporting people on low incomes to manage their finances.  MABS received funding of €16.4 million from my Department in 2006 to provide a free, confidential and independent service through a network of over 50 offices and 230 staff for people in debt or in danger of sliding into debt.  In 2005, almost 27,000 people used the service and so far this year 10,000 new clients have approached it.  The growth in demand can be attributed to the increase in the availability of credit and the quality of the service provided by MABS staff.  MABS is highly regarded and successful in meeting its clients' needs.  I propose to put MABS on a statutory basis to build on the best features of the MABS model of service to the public and thus ensure a modern and streamlined structure geared to meet the rapidly changing face of debt problems.  I intend to bring proposals before the Government in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_3279">The following table, which details the amount of funding allocated to MABS in each year since its inception, shows that funding increased by 69% between 2002 and 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_3347">Widows and widowers can qualify for one of a number of different schemes depending on their circumstances.  The contributory widow(er)'s pension is available to those who satisfy the necessary PRSI contribution conditions, either on their own record or that of the deceased spouse.  Those qualifying for this benefit are not subject to a means test.  Those without the necessary PRSI contributions can, if they have qualifying children, receive the one-parent family payment.  This is a means tested payment which comprises an earnings disregard, which is designed to assist with the extra costs those with children face in trying to access training or employment.  Up to €146.50 of earnings per week is completely disregarded, while earnings in excess of that and up to €375 per week are assessed at 50%.  This upper threshold was increased by €82 per week in the last Budget.  From 30 June 2006, people whose earnings have risen above €375 per week may be entitled to half of their payment for up to 26 weeks.  The widowed parent grant, introduced in 2000, also provides additional assistance following a bereavement.  The grant is set at €2,700 and is paid in addition to the usual after death payments.  In addition, increases in the rates of child benefit assist those widowed with children.  Since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have been increased significantly in accordance with Government commitments.  The current rates of child benefit are €150 per month for each of the first and second children and €185.00 per month for the third and subsequent children.  Furthermore, children under 6 years of age will also qualify for the annual €1000 early childcare supplement (ECS) announced in Budget 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3348">Widowed persons without dependent children may, if they are under 66 years of age, qualify for widow(er)'s non-contributory pension, or the state non-contributory pension if they are over 66 years of age. With regard to the latter, which I introduced in September, the basic means disregard was increased by €7.60 to €20 per week while a specific additional disregard of €100 per week has been included where the pensioner is in employment.  This is intended as an incentive to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working, or to re-enter the workforce and also applies to widow(er)s under 66 who are in receipt of widow(er)'s non-contributory pension.  Widowed persons are also entitled to the fuel allowance, back to school clothing and footwear allowance, and other secondary benefits, on the same basis as other social welfare recipients.  The adequacy of payments for widowed people, and for welfare recipients in general, is kept under review and, where appropriate, increases are granted in annual budgets.  In Budget 2006, widowed people received increases of between €14 and €17 per week which is well ahead of the rate of inflation.  I will continue to look for opportunities in the context of the forthcoming Budget to improve the position of this group.</p>

            <p eId="para_3350">My Department provides child income support in a number of ways.  The principal support is child benefit, (CB) a universal payment which is neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the child’s parents and does not contribute to poverty traps.  In addition to CB, child dependant allowances (CDAs) are paid to social welfare recipients in respect of qualified child dependants.  A third support is family income supplement (FIS), an employment support paid where a person with child dependants is in low-income employment.  The policy in recent years has been to maintain the rate of CDAs constant while concentrating additional resources in CB and FIS.  Over the period since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have increased by €111.91 at the lower rate and €135.48 at the higher rate, increases of 293.8% and 273.6% respectively.  Current child benefit rates are €150 per month for each of the first two children and €185 per month for the third and each subsequent child.  CB is paid to over 547,540 families in respect of approximately 1,060,740 children.  In addition, a number of improvements have been made to the FIS scheme over the years, including assessment of entitlement on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income thresholds, making it easier for lower income households to qualify for payment.  As a result, there are currently over 20,000 families receiving a weekly FIS payment, reaching over 38,000 children.  Any change to existing policy, including CDA increases, will be considered in a Budgetary context and in the context of an overall review of targeted child income supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_3352">The person concerned was in receipt of the maximum rate of one-parent family payment from the introduction of the scheme in 1997, having been previously in receipt of lone parent allowance from September 1995.  Customers receiving one-parent family payment can earn up to €146.50 per week without it affecting the rate of payment.  In the case of a person in employment, half of his or her earnings to a maximum of €375 per week, are assessed as means.  Recipients of the one-parent family payment scheme are obliged to notify my Department when there is a change in their circumstances, for example, when they commence employment or receive an increase in earnings.  One-parent family payment customers are advised of the requirement to notify my Department of any change in their circumstances when their entitlement is initially decided.  Failure to notify my Department about any change in circumstances can lead to a customer incurring an overpayment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3353">Following a review carried out by officers in my Department during 2003 it transpired that this customer was in employment and had earnings in excess of €293 per week during the tax years ending 5 April 2001, 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2002.  On the basis of her earnings from employment, it was decided that the customer was entitled to a transitional payment of half the rate of one parent family payment for the 12 month period to 4 April 2001.  The entitlement to one parent family payment ceased completely from 5 April 2001.  An overpayment of €19,577.76 resulted.  My Department has no record on file of having received any notification from the customer in 2001 regarding a change in her earnings.  Arrangements to repay the overpayment at the rate of €50 per month have been made in this case, and this has been communicated to the person concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_3355">Payment of disability benefit (now called Illness Benefit) to the person concerned was discontinued from 26 April 2006 following an examination by a Medical Assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He was advised of this decision and of his right to appeal.  The person did not appeal and submitted a final certificate from his own doctor dated 25/4/06, certifying that he was fit to resume work.  Correspondence was received from a solicitor representing the person concerned in September seeking to appeal the decision.  In the normal course an appeal against a Deciding Officer's decision must be made within 21 days of the decision.  While there is provision for acceptance of an appeal outside the normal 21 day period, in view of the medical evidence submitted it was considered that the acceptance of an appeal in this case would not be warranted, since he had furnished medical evidence from his own doctor that he was fit to resume work from 26 April 2006.  The solicitor was notified of this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3356">The person made a claim for unemployment assistance (since renamed Jobseekers Allowance) on 26 April 2006.  His claim was disallowed by a deciding officer on the ground that he was not genuinely seeking work and was not available for full-time employment.  He was advised of the decision on 22 September 2006 and of his right to appeal.  An appeal against this decision will be opened on behalf of the person concerned.  In accordance with the statutory requirements the relevant departmental papers and the comments of the Social Welfare Services Office on the matters raised in the appeals will be sought.  On receipt of the response the case will be referred to an Appeals Officer for early consideration.  Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.  These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_3478">In 2006, in the case of contributory pensions which are not means tested, a person may have a combined household income of up to €51 per week over and above the maximum rate of state pension (contributory), or savings/investments of up to €46,000, and still qualify for fuel allowance.  This additional income amount was increased to €51 per week with effect from 1 June 2005.  Prior to that, it was €38.10 per week from September 1999, having previously been set at €19.05 per week.  The overall fuel allowance income limits increase each season in line with the increases in the rate of the state pension (contributory).</p>
            <p eId="para_3479">Actual income from investments and money in savings accounts is not counted for means assessment purposes.  Instead all cash values of investments and property, all money in savings accounts and cash-in-hand are added together and this capital is assessed as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3480">the first €20,000 of capital is disregarded;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3481">capital between €20,000 and €30,000 is assessed on the basis of €1 weekly means for each €1,000 of capital;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3482">capital between €30,000 and €40,000 is assessed on the basis of €2 weekly means for each €1,000 of capital; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3483">capital above €40,000 is assessed on the basis of €4 weekly means for each €1,000 of capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_3484">Income limits on secondary sources of income in order to qualify for fuel allowance from 1997 are set out in column B in the following tabular statement attached.  The overall income limit is also set out in the statement.</p>

            <p eId="para_3582">Capital owned by an applicant for a social assistance payment is assessed, with a disregard of the first €20,000 of the amount held.  Any change to this disregard would have to be considered in the context of the budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_3583">In the case of inheritance, some persons making a will give consideration to the creation of a discretionary trust for people with a disability and this has somewhat different implications for the assessment of means.</p>
            <p eId="para_3584">A discretionary trust may be created by deed during a parent's (or other relative's) lifetime when a lump sum or windfall is to be invested, or it can be established in a will along with the naming of trustees.  Funds within a discretionary trust are administered at the discretion of the trustees and whether they are assessable as means will depend on how they are administered.</p>
            <p eId="para_3585">Where a discretionary trust fund is set up for a recipient of a social welfare means-tested payment, a life interest in such a fund would mean that any cash income that s/he may reasonably be expected to receive from it during a particular year is assessable as means.  Accordingly, periodic payments received from the fund are regarded as cash income and assessed as means.</p>
            <p eId="para_3586">However, funds used to purchase items of capital expenditure or services on behalf of the beneficiary do not constitute means e.g. money spent on renovating the house in which the claimant resides, the purchase of a car or holiday or assistive technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_3587">Similarly, occasional sums withdrawn or received by the claimant for particular purposes are not normally regarded as cash income for means purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3588">Transfers of capital to the beneficiary are assessable as capital.  Unspent balances held by the claimant (for example in the claimant's own bank account) are assessable under the rules governing capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_3589">In relation to secondary benefits, the free travel pass and any other extra benefit entitlements will remain with the person as long as they are in receipt of the relevant social welfare payment, whether at full or reduced rate.</p>

            <p eId="para_3596">Investment in public transport is a critical element of Government policy on transport for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA). Transport 21 is designed to inject a large amount of additional capacity into the public transport network over the next ten years, with a total investment of over €16bn in the GDA over its investment period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3597">By developing Metro North, Metro West, by extending the Luas network; by providing greater capacity on the DART and suburban rail network and by increasing significantly bus capacity, the annual number of public transport passenger journeys in Dublin will almost double. The objective is a four-fold increase in the numbers using suburban rail, while it is expected that over 100 million passengers will take the Luas and Metro every year when Transport 21 is delivered in full. Combined with a 60% increase in bus capacity, the target for passenger journeys in 2015 is 375 million as against approximately 200 million today.</p>
            <p eId="para_3598">Substantial traffic management measures in the Greater Dublin Area will also be required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3599">Transport 21 includes substantial funding provision for traffic management measures as an integral part of the transportation strategy for the Greater Dublin Area. The strategy aims to increase the modal share of public transport through infrastructure and service improvements and by encouraging a transfer of trips from the private car to more sustainable modes of transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_3600">In January of this year, the Dublin Transportation Office reviewed the bus priority programme in the context of the goal set in TRANSPORT 21 to double the length of bus priority infrastructure in the GDA within the 10-year period of TRANSPORT 21. A number of projects are now being implemented during the first 5 years of the period. In addition, last month, the DTO agreed to develop a public information programme to encourage less frequent use of single occupancy cars in the peak travel periods.</p>

            <p eId="para_3662">I do not consider that the Government's strategic objectives would be best served by a takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair.  It is my firm belief that Ireland's economic interests are best served by the provision, on a competitive basis, of regular, safe and cost-effective air services linking the country to key business and tourism markets around the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_3663">The Ryanair bid raises fundamental questions in relation to competition in aviation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3664">It is in the first instance a matter for the Board of Directors of Aer Lingus to evaluate the Ryanair offer and to express an opinion to its shareholders, including the State.  The Board has already made clear its intention in this respect in its public rejection of the Ryanair offer.  In any event my colleague, the Minister for Finance and I have already made clear that the State does not intend to sell its shares in Aer Lingus.</p>
            <p eId="para_3665">It is also the case that a proposal of this kind requires regulatory clearance from a competition perspective.  Ryanair formally notified the European Commission of its intention to acquire a controlling interest in Aer Lingus on 30th October. My Department and the Department of Finance are working closely with advisors to prepare a case, detailing our concerns from an aviation policy and competition perspective, for submission to the European Commission.  Officials of my Department met with the Competition Directorate of the European Commission on 20th October to set out the Government's concerns about the proposed takeover on competition grounds. Further contacts with the Commission will take place over the coming weeks.</p>

Ar ndóigh, in aon chás nach gcaitear an t-airgead atá curtha ar leataobh faoi cheannteideal ar leith den Vóta, athraítear an t-airgead sin go tograí eile laistigh den Vóta nó tugtar ar ais don Státchiste é.

As I have already outlined to the House, all of the findings and proposals emerging from the study will require careful and considered examination by my Department and no decisions will be made on foot of the study until that process has been completed.</p>

I have expressed the view to the local delivery agencies in Co. Sligo and Co.

Western Rural Development Company has indicated to my Department that it accepts this view.

            <p eId="para_3772">As outlined in reply to a previous Question from the Deputy, the person named applied to the 2005 National Reserve for an allocation of entitlements under Category D.  This category caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but did not receive any direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  The person named was deemed successful under this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_3773">However the person named also inherited land from a person who was the previous registered herdowner.  In these circumstances the person named automatically inherits any entitlements established for the person from whom the land was inherited.  The farmer from whom the land was inherited did not submit an Area Aid application during the 2000-02 reference period and because of this, while a Single Payment was established for that person the payment was not broken down into entitlements.  It was therefore necessary to convert that Single Payment into  standard entitlements before making an allocation from the National Reserve.  This conversion is now complete and the entitlements have been topped up by an allocation from the National Reserve.  A formal letter outlining the National Reserve allocation has issued to the person named and payment will issue shortly.</p>

These Regulations, as amended, allow the Minister to introduce schemes for the surrender of milk quota at the end of each milk quota year and the reallocation of the surrendered quota at the beginning of the subsequent milk quota year, including the setting of a maximum payment for surrendered and reallocated quota.  The Supreme Court, in its 2001 judgment in the case of Maher and others-v- Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and others, as reported in the Irish reports, held that the entitlement to a milk quota could not be equated to a right of property within the meaning of Articles 40.3.1, 40.3.2 and 43 of the Constitution.</p>

            <p eId="para_3813">In relation to the first, which deals with the application of the EIA Directive to proposed afforestation projects, my Department has always had systems in place to assess whether or not a project required a full Environmental Impact Assessment. However, we have agreed with the European Commission that this procedure could be made more explicit and could be improved upon to better reflect the requirements of the Directive.  Two meetings have taken place at official level between representatives of my Department and the European Commission where this issue was discussed in detail and where my Department provided details of new screening procedures, which have subsequently been introduced, to ensure Ireland's compliance with the EIA Directive.

            <p eId="para_3822">As part of the control procedures under EU legislation governing the Single Payment Scheme, the application was randomly selected for and was the subject of a ground eligibility and cross compliance inspection.</p>
            <p eId="para_3823">During the course of the cross-compliance inspection, errors were discovered with regard to the identification and registration of bovine animals which resulted in a 3% cross compliance penalty being applied. The person named had also been the subject of a cross compliance inspection in 2005 and had also incurred a 3% penalty for a similar infringement. The person named did not seek a review nor did he lodge an appeal against that decision.  Under the EU Regulations governing cross compliance and the rules regarding repetition of non-compliance, his penalty in 2005 was therefore multiplied by 3 to calculate the penalty for 2006. This has resulted in a 9% penalty being applied to his Single Payment for 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3824">The application has now been fully processed and an advance payment totalling €12,063.97 issued on 20th October 2006. Payment under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme totalling €3,970.95 issued on the 26th October 2006.</p>

The person named sold his milk quota in April 2003 and ceased farming.  He then gifted his farm and any associated Single Payment entitlements to his daughter in November 2003.  As the daughter of the person named was neither an active milk producer nor the owner of a milk quota she did not therefore satisfy the criteria for Category C.</p>
            <p eId="para_3830">Under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve in excess of 7,600 applicants have been deemed unsuccessful of which over 1,100 have appealed the decisions made.  A significant number of the appeals received relate to applicants being deemed unsuccessful as the required information in support of their National Reserve application was not submitted.  In relation to all appeals received, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in support of an appeal are first of all reviewed within my Department to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision.  Due to the type and volume of additional information received and to ensure fair and equitable treatment to all appellants, this review process can take some time to complete.  There are a total of 21 staff engaged in processing applications under the National Reserve.  These staff also carry out reviews on foot of appeals lodged by unsuccessful applicants.

A further €14.2 million was paid in respect of Modulation refund.   Insofar as the 2005 National Reserve is concerned the vast majority of applications have now been processed and decisions on eligibility have been made.  Some €15m has been paid to successful applicants under this measure.   Some 800 applications remain to be fully processed pending receipt of outstanding information in some cases while other cases have to be examined under the anti-accumulation measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_3833">Under the 2006 Single Payment Scheme, advance payments worth €549 million have been made to 116,700 applicants, who have declared eligible hectares and have entitlements under the Scheme, representing almost 92% of applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3834">In common with the coupled schemes, which the Single Payment Scheme replaced, delays in processing can be caused by many factors, including incomplete application forms, errors on applications and discrepancies highlighted following computer validation, which must be resolved via correspondence with the applicant. In many cases, payment could not be made because applicants did not submit an application to transfer the Single Payment entitlements, with lands, by way of inheritance, gift, lease or purchase; the majority of the 2006 cases which have yet to receive an advance payment are in the latter category.</p>

            <p eId="para_3864">The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department.  As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 4000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_3865">Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3866">As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that – with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_3867">A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06.  This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3872">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) was established under The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework which promotes regular school attendance and tackles the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that every child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3873">The Board is developing a nationwide service on a continuing basis that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board's functions locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_3874">The total authorised staffing complement of the Board is 94 comprising 16 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 12 Senior EWO's and 61 EWO's. Five regional teams are in place with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_3875">In deploying its service staff, the NEWB has prioritised the provision of services to the most disadvantaged areas and the most at-risk groups. This deployment includes areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme where an intensive full level of service is provided. Since September 2005 every county in Ireland is served by an educational welfare service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3876">In addition to the NEWB personnel there are some 490 staff, within the education sector, deployed in education disadvantage programmes whose work involves an element of school attendance and significant scope exists for integrated working between these personnel and Educational Welfare Officers. My Department is anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these substantial personnel resources. Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed including NEWB resources. It is anticipated that the outcome of this work will inform my Department on the staffing requirement for the NEWB into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_3877">This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education. I will be keeping the issue of the NEWB's staffing under review in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3878">In relation to the Deputy's query regarding the number of referrals made to the NEWB over the past four years, I have sought this information from the NEWB and will respond to the Deputy further when I receive it.</p>

            <p eId="para_3894">I want to assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to ensure that SSIA savers are treated fairly in the calculation of reckonable income under my Department's maintenance grant schemes. This is being achieved in two ways.  Firstly, income from SSIAs is being treated exactly the same as income from similar savings and investment products; and secondly, the reckonable income limits for student grants have been increased considerably in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3895">Since SSIAs were introduced, the amount of income to be included in respect of them is the government grant earned on the savings in the relevant tax year plus, in the case of savings accounts, the gross interest earned in the relevant tax year, and, in the case of investment accounts, the investment profit earned in the relevant tax year. Investment losses sustained in the relevant tax year are deductible.</p>
            <p eId="para_3896">The same position has long applied to interest earned on other savings products, including deposit accounts, post office savings certificates, life assurance bonds etc. The treatment of SSIAs is therefore consistent with the traditional treatment of other similar investments over many years. The Department of Finance is aware of this approach to the assessment of income for eligibility for student support.</p>
            <p eId="para_3897">So, in applying for a grant for the 2006/07 academic year, only the relevant income earned, as outlined above, on the SSIA in 2005 has to be declared. The maximum that the Government grant to any SSIA saver could have amounted to last year, as in any year of the SSIA scheme, is €762.  As I have pointed out in response to previous queries and PQs this has been the position since SSIAs were introduced.</p>

The Protestant and Jewish schools receive funding mainly by way of a Block grant, which has its origins in the desire of the State to enable pupils of the Protestant and Jewish persuasion to attend schools, which reflect their denominational ethos. Increased in line with capitation, the Block grant amounts to about €5.5m per annum. In the case of Protestant schools, the grant is paid to the Protestant Secondary Education committee which makes grants to needier Protestant children to enable them to attend school. The distribution of the grant by the Committee is not readily available to my Department. A similar arrangement is applied in the case of the Jewish school. Such schools also receive funding, other than the per capita grant, towards support services such as secretarial and caretaking and miscellaneous grants. Fee charging schools not embraced by the Block grant do not qualify for payment of capitation supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_3961">The following tables provide details of the current reckonable income limits.  In relation to income thresholds prescribed under the student maintenance grant schemes, the practice in recent years has been to increase the reckonable income limits for the ordinary rate of grant by at least the annual increase in the average industrial wage in the 12 months to September of the year prior to the relevant academic year. This year, an increase of 5.3% was approved, in the reckonable income limits for the 2006/2007 academic year, as has the allowance by which the income limits may be increased for each dependant where two or more children are in further or higher education. This increase was ahead of the 3.2% increase in the relevant reference period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3962">The Special Rates of Maintenance Grant, usually referred to as "top-up" grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000/01 academic year. The annual income threshold for the special rates of maintenance grant is increased, in line with the relevant social welfare payments. The current income threshold for "top-up" is €16,748.</p>
            <p eId="para_3963">The means test arrangements of the Student Support Schemes have been in operation since 1983 and are applied nationally.  In the case of both the employed and self-employed gross income is assessed with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments. Any proposal to move to introduce a different method of means assessment system would have significant financial implications in addition to equity issues which would have to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3964">While I have no plans to depart, in the foreseeable future, from the current practice in relation to increases in the reckonable income limits or method of means assessment under my Department's student maintenance grant schemes, I am committed to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes including increasing the income limits, as resources permit.</p>

            <p eId="para_4050">A total of 636 second level schools offered the Transition Year Programme in the 2005/06 school year, which represented almost 87% of all second level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4051">My Department publishes data on the number of pupils enrolled in each programme in its annual Statistical Report.  Although the report for the 2005/06 school year is still in preparation, I can inform the Deputy that the provisional figures of 25,808 pupils were enrolled in the Transition Year Programme for the 2005/06 school year. Information concerning the percentage of students availing of the programme is not available in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4052">Every year my Department invites all second level schools to participate in the Transition Year Programme. Circular 0034/2006 invited applications from schools for the 2006/2007 school year. Schools are given an additional grant of €63.49 per pupil to support the delivery of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4053">Schools providing the programme for the first time are required to register with the full-time Second Level Support Service which provides inservice training, advisory services, and website resources to support the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4054">Schools have flexibility to devise their own programme within the framework of the general guidelines published by my Department. This document sets out the overall aims, curriculum principles, suggested areas of content, teaching approaches, assessment and organisational arrangements for the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4055">The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has published its proposals for reform of senior cycle education. These envisage that students availing of a 3 year senior cycle programme will study at least 11 Transition Units and 2 short courses in addition to their chosen Leaving Certificate option. The flexibility and methodology which has been successfully adopted in the existing programme will continue, but the NCCA will develop a common template and validate a large range of Transition Units which can be offered in schools. A mechanism will also be developed under which schools and agencies may develop modules and have them validated for inclusion in the programme. The greater standardisation of Transition Units is a welcome development. I have indicated to the Council my preference that, for equity reasons, the Transition Year should be retained as a single year stand alone programme.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4057">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary in recent years. There are now 4000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_4058">Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</p>
            <p eId="para_4059">Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4060">As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that – with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_4061">A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06.</p>
            <p eId="para_4062">This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_4064">This Government is committed to modernising school buildings throughout the country and is determined to ensure that every child is educated in a suitable and comfortable environment. Under the largest school building programme in the history of the State we are investing over €500 million on school buildings in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_4065">Between 2000 and 2005 my Department invested over €2 billion on educational infrastructure on over 6,500 individual school projects. This investment is catering for the construction of new schools, large scale extensions and refurbishments, a wide range of projects under the Summer Works Scheme and a variety of other projects under devolved schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4066">While the challenge before us in reversing decades of under-investment in school buildings and in responding to emerging needs in new population areas is great, nonetheless we are making huge progress.  I can assure the Deputy that the €3.9 billion capital envelope will enable my Department to continue to take a pro-active approach to transforming school accommodation throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_4068">Children who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes or units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_4069">The allocation of resources for children with special educational needs is based on the criteria set out in my Department's circulars having regard to the recommendations of the Report of the Special Education Review Committee 1993, also known as the SERC Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_4070">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special needs supports such as resource teaching hours and special needs assistant (SNA) support on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The teaching and SNA support allocated are intended to enable schools to meet the needs of pupils as outlined in psychological and other professional reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_4071">In allocating additional teaching and SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs examine the teaching and other resources available within the individual schools. The SENO also operates within the parameters of my Department's criteria for the allocation of such resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4072">Primary schools are also supported by means of a general allocation which provides additional teaching support to enable schools to cater for pupils with high incidence special educational needs, such as dyslexia, and those with low attainments. Second level schools continue to be supported by the allocation of additional teaching hours, where appropriate, for each pupil enrolled who is assessed as having a special educational need. SNA support is allocated, as appropriate, to all schools where there are confirmed assessed care needs in respect of students.</p>
            <p eId="para_4073">My Department's policy and approach in the area of special education is underpinned by Statute, particularly the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, also known as the EPSEN Act, which was enacted in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_4074">While many sections of the Act have already commenced, the remaining sections to be implemented relate mainly to the statutory assessment, appeal and education plan processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4075">The NCSE recently submitted its Implementation Report which sets out its views and recommendations on a plan for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_4076">Both the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 refer to the need to co-ordinate and plan special needs resources in both the Health and Education sectors. The level of resources needed will be considered in the context of the Implementation Report and the Sectoral Plan in relation to Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_4080">The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post primary school network where children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration.  My Department supports an eclectic approach to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods can be applied specific to the needs of individual pupils. The Deputy will be familiar with the variety of current provision in this regard which includes pre-school classes for children with autism, special classes for children with autism attached to special schools and mainstream schools, special classes for Asperger's syndrome plus a range of supports for pupils with autism integrated in mainstream classes.  A pilot scheme facilitated the establishment of 12 specific autism units and these are represented under the umbrella organisation of Irish Autism Action.</p>

            <p eId="para_4088">The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.    The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is actively engaged in identifying a suitable school placement for the child referred to by the Deputy. As an interim measure pending his placement he is in receipt of home tuition.</p>

The teaching and special needs assistant (SNA) support allocated are intended to enable schools to meet the needs of pupils as outlined in psychological and other professional reports. In allocating SEN supports for individual pupils, the SENOs examine the teaching and other resources available within the individual schools. The SENO also operates within the parameters of my Department's criteria for the allocation of such resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4091">I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has received a request from the school in question for special needs assistant support for the pupil.

            <p eId="para_4367">With regard to an appeals process, the Deputy will be aware that the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 was enacted in July 2004. The Special Education Appeals Board (SEAB) was established under section 36 of the Act to hear and determine appeals pursuant to a number of sections of the Act. The SEAB will become operational as soon as the relevant sections of the Act have come into effect.  The relevant sections of the Act could not come into effect without the NCSE having an opportunity to present an implementation report to me, which it did recently and I am currently considering its contents.</p>
            <p eId="para_4368">In the interim, the NCSE will undertake to review a decision taken by a special educational needs organiser (SENO) on foot of a request from a school or parents/guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision. The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05.</p>

            <p eId="para_4382">The Harris Report was published by the Stationery Office in July of this year and a copy is available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_4383">Improving students' competences in spoken and written Irish is a major policy priority of my Department and a range of measures have been taken in this regard, with plans for further actions to take effect in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_4384">At primary level, a revised curriculum in Irish has been implemented in all schools since September 2003.  A communicative, task-based approach to language learning is at the heart of this curriculum which places emphasis on enjoyment and on using the language in activities such as games, conversations and drama. Its implementation has been supported by a national programme of 3500 in-service training seminars for 21000 primary teachers.    I have arranged that part of the drama in-service training planned for primary teachers in the current academic year will be ‘Dramaíocht trí Ghaeilge'.  This will assist teachers enormously in making the learning of Irish fun for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_4385">At post primary level, the Second Level Support Service provides a series of modular programmes for teachers in Irish through the education centre network. Additional personnel are being appointed at present to support and expand in-career development for teachers in Irish in our schools at both primary and second level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4386">For Leaving Certificate Irish, a revised literature course was introduced in September 2004 which was examined for the first time in June of this year.  This has been widely welcomed as it allows literature to be taught using modern communicative approaches that appeal to young people and it affords a high level of choice to students and teachers.  For example, film is now an option for the first time.  A comprehensive set of guidelines to support teachers in delivering the revised course has been issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_4387">Substantial progress has been made in the provision of textbooks and resources to support Irish in schools, particularly since Scéim na nDearthóirí was established in 2001 and An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta was set up in 2002.  Some €3m. has been invested under the Scéim over the period 2003-2005 in a new set of materials for schools, known as Séideán Sí for infant, senior infant and first and second class  pupils.  This investment will continue until a complete set of resources for the eight year primary cycle is available.</p>
            <p eId="para_4388">An Chomhairle works closely with An Gúm, Scéim na nDearthóirí and other agencies to address the deficit in Irish medium resources and materials.  It has published an extensive resource directory, running to 86 pages, on the website <i>www.cogg.ie</i> on materials and resources now available to support the teaching of Irish in the curriculum, and the teaching of other subjects through Irish, across primary and post primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4389">In regard to entry to primary teacher training, a minimum of Grade C at higher level in Irish continues to be a requirement.  These students also undertake a summer programme in the Gaeltacht as part of their training.  In regard to the Scrúdú le hAghaidh Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge which must be passed by primary teachers who trained abroad within 5 years of starting to teach in Ireland, a range of improvements have been made to the management and administration of the examinations, in addition to the development of a handbook and provision of courses for participants.  This has greatly increased the success rate in the examination. A range of higher education programmes through Irish are being offered by NUI Galway and Dublin City University, and to a lesser extent by other third level colleges.</p>
            <p eId="para_4390">Finally, my Department and the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs provide grant schemes to support the provision of summer courses in the Gaeltacht for some 25,000 young people each year, enabling them to immerse themselves in Irish language and culture.</p>
            <p eId="para_4391">I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the statutory body which advises on curriculum, to make proposals to me as soon as possible on how the syllabuses in Irish at post-primary level should be reformed and, in particular, how greater emphasis can be placed on oral competence in the language.  I am determined to ensure that Irish is taught in our schools in a way that is interesting and relevant and will promote a positive attitude to the language among our young people.</p>

            <p eId="para_4396">A key area covered in the report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education — which was asked to advise on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by disadvantaged students — is the Special Rates of Maintenance Grant (also known as the Top-Up Grant).    Eligibility is determined by reference to an income threshold and receipt of a long-term social welfare payment as set out below:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4397">1.  An applicant must qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4398">2. Total reckonable income in the relevant tax year must not exceed the lower income limits as set out in the relevant Maintenance Grant Schemes and, where applicable, net of Child Dependant Increase payments</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4399">3. As at the prescribed date — i.e. 31st December each year — the source of income must include one of the eligible long-term Social Welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4400">For the 2006/2007 academic year the non-adjacent, ordinary grant plus the top-up has been increased to €5,970 and the adjacent rate to €2,390 i.e. a Top-Up of €2,860 and €1,145 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_4401">Officials of my Department contacted the Higher Education Grants Section of both County Mayo VEC and Mayo County Council concerning the candidates referred to by the Deputy.  It is understood from both awarding authorities that the candidates were not eligible for the Top-Up grant as the reckonable income exceeded the prescribed limit for the academic year 2006/2007 which is €16,748.    I regret that it is not possible to allow grant aid where reckonable income exceeds the prescribed limits irrespective of the particular circumstances.    Financial Assistance is also available from my Department through the Student Assistance Fund which is ESF-aided and administered by the National Office for Equity of Access to Third Level Education (National Office).</p>
            <p eId="para_4402">This Fund assists students who, having commenced a third-level course, experience financial hardship and, therefore, may be unable to continue their third-level studies. Applications for funding should be made by the individual student to the Access Officer in their institution. The Fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4403">The Millennium Partnership Fund is a community-based fund that supports retention and participation among under-represented groups of students in further or higher education. Partnership Companies and Community Groups manage the Fund locally. The following Area Partnership Company is in the Deputy's constituency area:</p>

            <p eId="para_4418">The ICT in Schools Programme commenced in 1998 following the publication of Schools IT2000.  The objective of the Programme is to ensure that all students have the opportunity to achieve computer literacy and to acquire the necessary skills for participation in the Information Society.  By the end of last year, over €170m was invested in the Programme since its commencement including some €114m in Capital supports.  In terms of support to schools for the purchase of IT equipment and the development of their infrastructure (capital), over €77m has been expended in capital grants direct to schools in the years 2001 to 2005.    A further €6m has been expended in indirect school infrastructural support on Innovative Projects, Training and Broadband support costs over the same period.</p>

The broadband connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network supported by HEAnet, in order to provide managed Internet access, email, security controls and content filtering.  A broadband support service is being managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network. The overall costs of the Schools Broadband Access Programme, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the three years, are in the region of €30m.</p>
            <p eId="para_4422">I have also announced the provision of €40m to schools to address Health and Safety issues and the introduction of the new Technology syllabus and the revised Design and Communication Graphics syllabus at Leaving Certificate level.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4433">The Road Safety Authority has already commenced work on a number of key areas including the development of a Road Safety programme for use in Transition Year.  This work is being undertaken in co-operation with my Department and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4434">I believe that schools have a role to play both in teaching students about road safety issues and in helping them to develop the attitudes necessary to promote safe behaviour on the roads.  The Social Personal and Health Education programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others can be developed and promoted among students.  SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way.</p>
            <p eId="para_4435">Specific materials for teaching young people about road safety have also been given to schools.  At the start of the 2001/02 school year the National Safety Council, with assistance from my Department, distributed copies of Staying Alive – a road safety resource for Transition Year and the Senior Cycle — to all second level schools.  This pack contained a wide range of learning opportunities and activities on topics such as personal responsibility and decision-making, environmental issues and risks and rules for road users.  A CD-ROM with additional material downloaded from the Internet was included in the pack along with copies of the Rules of the Road.  In the preparation of the Staying Alive resources material, views were sought from a range of organisations with interests in the promotion of road safety.  Prior to its issue to second level schools, the material was piloted in 20 schools and the response from teachers in those schools was very positive.  This is also supplemented by Garda visits to primary and second level schools during which the themes of crime, road safety, personal safety and substance abuse are explored as part of the SPHE programme.  There were some 1900 school visits in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_4436">So, not only is there a curricular framework in place already in which the importance of road safety can be taught to our young people, but this is supplemented by specific teaching materials and by a comprehensive programme of Garda visits to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4437">My Department will continue to work with the Road Safety Authority to strengthen the role of schools in promoting road safety even further.</p>

            <p eId="para_4452">Capitation grants constitute the main form of government funding towards primary and voluntary secondary school operating costs, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in my view, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items. As schools are not required to supply returns of actual income and expenditure, I am not in a position to indicate the percentage of expenditure covered by these grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_4453">In relation to the level of capitation grants, I am aware of ongoing demands by school managerial bodies for additional funding and I am committed to improving the funding position of our schools in the context of overall resources made available in the estimates and in the light of competing demands across the education sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_4454">There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding provided to primary and voluntary secondary schools. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €145.58 in 2006. This represents an increase of almost 155% in the grant over that period. This grant is in addition to the Ancillary Services grant which provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial assistance. The standard rate of grant under this scheme has also being substantially increased from €102 per pupil in 2002 to the current rate of €139 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_4455">In the case of voluntary secondary schools the standard per capita grant of €256 per pupil in the school year 2001/02, has been increased and now stands at €298 per pupil from January, 2006. Secondary schools have also benefited under the school services support fund initiative. Introduced with effect from the 2000/01 school year, the services support grant has been increased to the current rate of €159 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4456">These significant increases in the funding of our schools are a clear indication of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_4463">My Department provides funding to primary and secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. It is a matter for the authorities of these schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability.</p>
            <p eId="para_4464">There have been significant improvements in the level of funding provided to primary and post-primary schools. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €133.58 with effect from 1st January, 2005 and has been further increased by €12 per pupil with effect from 1st January, 2006 bringing the standard rate to €145.58. This represents an increase of almost 155% in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_4465">At second level, the standard per capita grant, which stood at €256 per pupil in the school year 2001/02, has been increased by a further €12 to €298 per pupil from January, 2006. Under the School Services Support Fund initiative secondary schools will also benefit from further significant increases. The grant that was increased for secondary schools from €131 per pupil to €145 per pupil in January, 2005, has been increased by a further €14 per pupil to €159 per pupil from January, 2006. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. A secondary school with 500 pupils now receives annual grants of up to €270,000 towards general expenses and support services as against annual grants of up to €237,000 in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_4466">These significant increases in the funding of primary and post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. I have no immediate plans to meet the State Claims Agency.</p>

            <p eId="para_4468">The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level vocational schools and for community and comprehensive schools reflect the different management and ownership arrangements that apply to schools at second level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4469">Financial allocations for Vocational schools and Community Colleges are made to the VECs as part of a block grant that in addition to specific provision for teacher, administrative and maintenance staffing pay costs also covers VEC overheads and other activities other than the 2nd level programme. Capitation represents a core determinant of funding and financial allocations reflect</p>
            <p eId="para_4470">adjustment for variation in enrolments, based on the number of students attending as at 30th September each year, and increases in general second level per capita grants.  Excluding pay, the total non-pay provision made available in the estimates for VECs for 2006 is some €51.3 million. The Department does not earmark funding and staffing allocations for individual schools or for the various activities of VECs. The way in which such allocations are distributed among schools is a matter for each committee in line with their priorities and perceptions of need.  As VECs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of their budgets, the extent of information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department and would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.</p>
            <p eId="para_4471">The budget arrangements for Comprehensive &amp; Community schools are based mainly on pupil numbers, but also take into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as disadvantaged status, age of buildings, size of school etc. Each school is given, in addition to grants towards secretarial and maintenance assistance, a budget towards general operating costs. The non-pay provision made available in the estimates for Comprehensive &amp; Community schools is some €23 million for 2006. While schools have considerable discretion as to how this funding is best utilised in the interests of pupils, the main operating costs include heat, lighting, maintenance and repairs of buildings, school materials and equipment.  As in the case of VECs, school budget adjustments from year to year reflect variation in enrolments and increases in general second level per capita grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_4472">Major improvements have been made in both the funding and the staffing of our second level schools in recent years and I will continue to prioritise this area.</p>

         asked the

         the steps he has taken to address extremely high levels of radon gas recorded by the RPII in respect of areas in County Kerry, including Annascaul and Castleisland; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [35240/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_824">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_4516">Following the identification in July, 2003 of a house in Castleisland with radon concentration levels of approximately 49,000 Becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m3), the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) undertook a survey of houses in the area. This involved the RPII writing to 2,500 householders in and adjacent to the town of Castleisland informing them of the very high reading found in the house in Castleisland and advising them to have radon measurements carried out in their homes.  By way of response, some 400 householders in the area requested radon measurements.  The results of that survey, and subsequent measurements of a number of houses in the area, show that the exceptionally high radon concentration level has not been replicated to date in other houses in the area.  The highest concentration level found was just over 6,100 Bq/m3, while the average concentration was just under 150 Becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m3), which is below the national reference level of 200 Bq/m3.  Radon measurements were also completed in respect of 89 local authority homes in Castleisland, none of which were found to have radon concentrations in excess of the national reference level.   The levels of radon found in Annascaul by the RPII have been much lower than found in some of the homes in Castleisland and in neighbouring Tralee.</p>
            <p eId="para_4517">Over the years, the Government, through the RPII, has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to highlighting public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high radon concentrations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4518">The nationwide survey of radon in domestic dwellings carried out by the RPII in the 1990s enabled the RPII to identify and define high radon areas, i.e. areas where the RPII would estimate that more than 10% of the houses have radon concentrations levels above the national reference level of 200 Bq/m3. The results of the RPII survey as well as a comprehensive map showing high radon areas in Ireland are available on the RPII's website at <i>www.rpii.ie</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_4519">Information to the public from the RPII, through press releases and radio and TV interviews, and published reports on radon, has regularly highlighted the risks associated with exposure to radon. Householders, particularly those in high radon areas, are constantly encouraged to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake radon remediation works where necessary. In this context, the RPII has produced a radio advertisement for use on local radio in High Radon Areas</p>
            <p eId="para_4520">Other initiatives to further heighten public awareness of the radon issue include the RPII's annual National Radon Forum. The aim of these Fora, the first of which was held in 2002, is to provide the opportunity for those with an interest in radon to come together and discuss issues of mutual interest. These Fora are open to the public and, therefore, help to further raise public awareness of radon. In 2005, the Forum was held in Tralee. The 5th Forum will be held on 16 November 2006 in Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_4521">The RPII has published a booklet entitled Understanding Radon — A Householder's Guide, and has also produced and distributed an information poster on radon for display in libraries, medical centres, etc., advising people to have their homes checked for radon. In 2004, as part of a heightened radon awareness campaign, the RPII began a series of nationwide public information seminars, or roadshows, on the dangers of radon which are targeted at selected high radon areas. These involve the RPII meeting with local groups, including, where possible, the local authority and/or the local chamber of commerce; presentations to schools; hand-outs in shopping centres, etc. over a 2 to 3 day period.  So far, the RPII has held 7 of these seminars or roadshows in different locations throughout the country, including one in Tralee in 2005, and more are planned. In addition, the RPII operated an information stand at this years's National Ploughing Championship and it is planned to run similar information stands at selected public events in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4522">Upgraded building regulations, introduced in June 1997 by my Department, require all new houses commencing construction on or after 1 July 1998 to incorporate radon protection measures. In October 2004, my Department published an updated edition of its Technical Guidance Document C on Part C of the Building Regulations (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing construction on or after 1 April 2005. This new guidance document is aimed at ensuring that the 1997 radon protection measures are carried out more effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_4523">In February 2002, my Department also published a booklet entitled Radon in Existing Buildings – Corrective Options advising designers, builders and home owners on remediation options for reducing radon in existing houses to, or below, the national reference level of 200 Bq/m3.</p>
            <p eId="para_4524">As is clear from the above, considerable resources are being expended by Government on promoting public awareness of radon. Government efforts and resources, together with the RPII, will continue to focus on highlighting public awareness of radon and on improving information to householders and employers so as to enable and encourage them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</p>

            <p eId="para_4564">I propose to take Questions Nos. 617 and 618 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4565">The May 2006 edition of Technical Guidance Document L includes two methods of demonstrating compliance with Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations. The primary reason for allowing the two methods is to provide options for some flexibility in how heat loss through the building fabric is limited, via the Overall Heat Loss (OHL) method, and a simple method — the Elemental method suits those who do not wish to deal with the complexity of additional calculations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4566">Part L standards for Dwellings are due for revision in 2008 at the latest, as required under the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. In this context, the appropriateness of continuing the two methods will be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_4567">The Question appears to refer to a report (30 May 2006) by the UK based Building Research Establishment (BRE), which was commissioned by an Irish timber frame manufacturer. The report sets out a calculated comparison of the above two methods of achieving compliance with Part L for a small sample of English dwellings.</p>
            <p eId="para_4568">In its conclusion, the BRE report claims that houses built to comply with the elemental method (and not the OHL method as cited in the Question) will use about 30% less energy for space heating than the those complying with the OHL method.</p>
            <p eId="para_4569">This conclusion is not necessarily accepted by my Department as the BRE Report does not contain sufficient information to allow independent review and validation of its assumptions and calculations.</p>

            <p eId="para_4572">A number of measures have been introduced by my Department to combat motor tax evasion, and other enforcement initiatives are being developed in conjunction with the Garda. As an indication of the impact of these measures in terms of motor tax compliance, motor tax revenue has increased this year by some 10% compared with last year, without any increase in rates and against a 6% increase in national vehicle fleet. This position is also reinforced through increased levels of payment of motor tax arrears; to date in 2006 arrears represent an increase of almost 11% over the same period in 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_4603">The review of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme, which incorporates the conditions governing the Essential Repairs Grant scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly scheme was recently finalised within my Department.  The level of grants available under these schemes has been considered in the context of the overall review.</p>
            <p eId="para_4604">My Department is currently preparing proposals for the future operation of the schemes, in conjunction with other public agencies concerned, and the issue of the operation by the HSE of the ‘top-up grant' is being examined as part of this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4605">I am very much aware of the importance of the efficient operation of the Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant schemes in assisting with the provision of appropriate accommodation for disabled and elderly persons in the community.  The focusing of the schemes on real needs, both financial and accommodation-related and its operation in an efficient manner is critical in ensuring that it achieves its aim.  I am confident that the revised schemes will significantly contribute to this achievement and I expect to be in a position to announce these shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_4607">The procedures currently governing boundary alterations are set out in Part V of the Local Government Act 1991 and in the Local Government (Boundary Alteration) Regulations 1996. Part 8 of the Local Government Act 2001, which has yet to be commenced, provides that a local authority proposing to alter its boundary would follow similar procedures to those currently in force, but would make the application directly to an independent Local Government Commission which would then report to the Minister on the matter. The Commission would also report to the Minister on other specialised local government matters. I am considering the steps necessary to commence the relevant provisions of the 2001 Act and I am in discussion with local government interests, in that regard. In the meantime, local authorities may use the provisions of the 1991 Act to prepare a boundary alteration proposal.</p>
