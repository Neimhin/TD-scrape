          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_10">I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, for attending today's meeting. In addition to the usual brief members will have received the conclusions from the last General Affairs and External Relations Council and the eight points discussed at that meeting. I welcome also a study group from Germany visiting the Oireachtas today. It is hoped they will be able to meet some committee members following the meeting. I wish the delegation an enjoyable and informative visit.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">In accordance with normal procedures such meetings, the Minister of State will make his presentation and we will then discuss the agenda as regards general affairs and external relations.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_12">I wish at the outset to express my condemnation and revulsion at the murder in Iraq of a US civilian. The manner in which Mr. Nick Berg was murdered was particularly brutal and gruesome. I express my sincere condolences to his family and friends. Ireland also calls for the immediate safe release of all hostages in Iraq and for the ending of the vile practice of kidnapping.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I am pleased to have this opportunity to appear before the committee to review the agenda of the forthcoming General Affairs and External Relations Council, the fifth during the Irish Presidency. The Council will be chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, will represent Ireland and participate in the Council. I propose to begin by saying a few words concerning the IGC ministerial meeting which will take place next Monday and Tuesday. I will then turn to the agenda items due for discussion at the Council. I am, of course, happy to take any questions which members may have on the forthcoming Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">While the Minister for Foreign Affairs outlined the Presidency's proposed work programme and timetable for dealing with the IGC at last month's Council, this month's meeting will be the first opportunity for Foreign Ministers to have a substantive discussion of the IGC since the decision of the European Council to reconvene negotiations. Foreign Ministers will meet over two days to discuss the outstanding IGC issues in detail. The Presidency is currently finalising the agenda but it is likely that there will be discussions on outstanding institutional and non-institutional issues. The Presidency is also finalising a number of papers intended to facilitate discussion and these will be circulated to the committee when available.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The Taoiseach wrote to his colleagues on the European Council on 8 April asking them to take a positive and focused approach. This was very much in evidence at last week's meeting of senior officials. Members have been circulated with the working document which formed the basis for that meeting at which officials discussed the outstanding non-institutional issues and considerable progress was made. The Presidency believes that, while of course nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, consensus has been found on a significant number of these issues and hopes that next week's meeting of Foreign Ministers will confirm that consensus.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">There are a number of other non-institutional issues that require further discussion at ministerial level and these will be set out in our papers to be published later this week. They include such issues as the procedures for adopting the Union's annual budget and decision-making in the Common Commercial Policy. Members will be aware of the Taoiseach's wish to make progress on as many issues as possible before negotiations return to the level of Heads of State and Government at the June European Council. We have decided to have a discussion on the scope of qualified majority voting to encourage progress on this difficult set of issues which is unlikely to be resolved until the end of the negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">The Presidency also intends to have a discussion on the question of the composition of the European Commission. We know that a final solution to this issue will depend on the overall balance of the institutional package. Next week's meeting is an opportunity to build on the commitment displayed by partners at the Spring European Council and at the meeting of senior officials. Together with the tour of capitals currently being undertaken by the Taoiseach where he is meeting with all his counterparts on the European Council, we will seek to make significant progress towards agreement on a new constitutional treaty for the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The principal item for consideration on the Council's general affairs agenda will be preparations for the European Council due to take place in Brussels on 17 and 18 June. The items expected to feature on the draft annotated agenda include senior appointments, justice and home affairs issues, terrorism, enlargement, future financial perspectives, economic issues and employment and external relations. At Monday's meeting Ministers will have an initial opportunity to review the proposed agenda. Work will continue on this in the coming weeks and will be finalised by Ministers at their meeting immediately before the European Council in June.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">I will now deal with the session on external relations. The Council will consider developments in the Middle East peace process. Last week the international Quartet met in New York at principals' level. The European Union was represented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten. The Quartet statement issued reaffirmed the road map and the commitment to a negotiated two state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is envisaged that Council conclusions will welcome the Quartet statement. Ministers will also consider the outcome of the Euro-Mediterranean mid-term ministerial meeting held in Dublin Castle on 5 and 6 May. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will report on bilateral meetings held with the Israeli and Palestinian Foreign Ministers which took place in the margins of that meeting. He will also report on contacts with Arab partners at the meeting on the question of the Arab League summit at which the Presidency intends to be represented at a high level. In this connection, Ministers will consider the outcome of the Arab League Foreign Ministers' meeting which took place in Cairo on 7 and 8 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">In accordance with mandates issued by the European Council, it has now become the norm, followed by successive Presidencies, that EU Defence Ministers should meet within the framework of the Council and with their Foreign Minister counterparts at least once during every six month period. Accordingly, this month the Council will meet Defence Ministers. The Council will permit a review of a range of issues relating to military and civilian aspects of EU peacekeeping and crisis management under the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">In terms of specifics, the Council is due to endorse a report prepared by High Representative Javier Solana on developing the EU's capacity for rapid response in the peacekeeping and crisis management area, particularly in support of the United Nations. The United Nations has expressed keen support for the development of this sort of EU capability. The Council is also expected to consider measures aimed at assisting development of African capacities for peacekeeping and crisis management and ongoing work on the development of other aspects of the EU's capacity for military peacekeeping and crisis management to review progress on the steps being taken to establish a European Defence Agency, as mandated by the Thessaloníki European Council in June 2003, and endorse proposals aimed at further developing the EU's means of protecting civilian populations against the effects of terrorist attacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">In the area of civilian crisis management, Ministers will review the two EU police missions currently under way in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is also expected that Ministers will take note of ongoing work in the future development of EU capabilities for civilian crisis management. I am pleased to report that good progress is being made in each of the various areas. Further detailed reports on these matters and on the closely related subject of conflict prevention will be submitted for approval by Ministers in June prior to onward transmission to the European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Harri Holkeri, the special representative of the UN Secretary General in Kosovo, will participate in the Council in an exchange of views on developments in Kosovo since the flare up of violence in March. He is likely to discuss with Ministers ways in which the UN's policy of standards before status can be strengthened. The EU remains fully committed to building a stable, secure and multi-ethnic Kosovo. The political leaders of Kosovo need now to demonstrate in an unambiguous manner their commitment to a multi-ethnic society upholding the security and human rights of all communities in Kosovo.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The Thessaloníki Agenda, agreed at the EU-western Balkans summit last June, reaffirmed the European perspective on the countries of the western Balkans. Former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia will take a step towards realising its ambition of eventual membership of the EU if the Council formally accepts the Presidency proposal to request the Commission to prepare its opinion on the Macedonian application for EU membership. The Council will also welcome adoption later this month of European partnerships for each of the countries of the region as an important demonstration of the European Union's commitment to the implementation of the Thessaloníki Agenda. Full implementation of the agenda has been an Irish Presidency priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">The Council is expected to consider the European neighbourhood policy on the basis of a strategy paper which is to be adopted by the Commission today. It is possible that, given the very short lead time between the release of this paper and the Council meeting, the policy will have to be considered at the Council meeting on 14 June, in preparation for the European Council. This is an important initiative which Ireland strongly supports and is all the more important now that enlargement has taken place. Many of the countries involved in the process now share direct land borders with the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">Together with the strategy paper to be adopted today, the Commission will also issue a draft financial instrument, together with "country papers" for each of the countries for which the first group of action plans under the policy will be created: Ukraine, Moldova, Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The Presidency will work closely with the Commission to ensure that the policy can be further developed before the end of the Irish Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">The third EU-Latin America-Caribbean summit takes place in Guadalajara, Mexico, in just over two weeks, on 28 May. It will be jointly chaired by the Taoiseach and President Fox of Mexico. This month's Council will review preparations for the summit which is an important event in the European Union's relations with Latin America and the Caribbean. Two over-arching themes have been chosen for the summit: effective multilateralism and social cohesion. The summit also takes place against the background of ongoing negotiations between the EU and Mercosur on a comprehensive association agreement and the demands by the countries of Central America and the Andean community for a date to be set for the opening of negotiations on similar association agreements with their respective regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will attend the EU-Russia summit which President Putin will host in Moscow on 21 May. The Commission President, Mr. Prodi, and High Representative Javier Solana will also attend. Next week's Council will take note of the current state of preparations for the summit. However, work with Russia will continue beyond the Council, right up to the eve of the summit. The extension, on 27 April, of the EU-Russia partnership and co-operation agreement to the ten new EU member states was a significant achievement on an issue which had dominated the EU-Russia agenda for some time. This has created a positive climate for the meeting which will be the first EU-Russia summit following EU enlargement and President Putin's re-election for a second term.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">This month's Council will also consider the question of an association agreement with Syria. The Barcelona process is the cornerstone of the EU's dealings with the countries of the Mediterranean. Through it, the EU has developed dialogue with its Mediterranean partners in the political, economic and social spheres. The EU association agreements are key components of the structures through which this dialogue takes place. The EU has concluded association agreements with all its EuroMed partners, except Syria. Agreement has been reached on almost all elements of the association agreement and the only outstanding issue is the wording of a non-proliferation clause. In November 2003 the Council called for the inclusion in all third party agreements of a clause providing for co-operation in countering the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and their means of delivery. The Syrian agreement will be the first EuroMed association agreement with such a clause. In an effort to conclude the negotiations, the Presidency has proposed compromise language which will give effect to the intentions of the non-proliferation policy of the EU. It is hoped that next week's Council can agree a way forward based on this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">A number of meetings are due to be held in the margins of the Council. The 14th meeting of the EU-Gulf Co-operation Joint Ministerial Council will take place on the evening of Monday, 17 May. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will chair the Council as part of our Presidency. Items to be discussed include the implementation of the co-operation agreement and progress in negotiations on an EU-GCC free trade agreement. Ministers will exchange views on recent developments in the EU and the GCC, the Middle East peace process, the EU strategic partnership, Iran, Iraq, terrorism, human rights and non-proliferation issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">The Minister will also chair the seventh EU-Ukraine Co-operation Council. Commissioner Patten and Ambassador Tom de Bruijn will also attend on the EU side. Prime Minister Yanukovych will lead the Ukrainian delegation. This Co-operation Council follows the recent meeting of the EU-Ukraine Foreign Ministers' Troika in Dublin on 29 April. A wide range of issues will be discussed during the formal Co-operation Council and the subsequent dinner. Internal political and economic developments in Ukraine, developments in the EU, the European neighbourhood policy, EU-Ukraine relations and international issues all appear on the agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">I am happy to take questions from members of the committee.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Chairman" eId="spk_3">

          <p eId="para_33">This committee would like to be fully associated with the Minister's comments on the murder of Nick Berg, the US citizen, by Iraqi extremists.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">I note from the resolutions, opinions and decisions of the general affairs section of the agenda that Commission document 190 of 2004, which relates to the proposal for a Council decision and agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of passenger name records data by air carriers to the US Department of Homeland Security and the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection is up for discussion and there may be a decision on it. As far as I know, the matter has been referred by the European Parliament to the Court of Justice for a decision because of concern about certain aspects of the transfer of such data. Will this be considered at the meeting? Are data protection measures sufficient? What follow up measures are likely to be taken? As this is an international agreement, will it be necessary for the Dáil to ratify it? Will there be sufficient protection for those who hand over data for use in this way?</p>

          <p eId="para_35">I am conscious that this matter has been raised here before. During the recent European parliamentary debate on the agreement some concerns were expressed on the transfer of data to third countries by the US authorities. As a direct result of these concerns, further negotiations took place with the US authorities and these have resulted in an improved adequacy finding which is currently under review by the data review committee. One significant advance has been the agreement to establish an independent security authority to review the transfer of data to third countries. This is an aspect of the agreement that will be closely monitored. I am satisfied that any such transfer of data by the US authorities would only be in the interests of security and passenger safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">Overall, we are satisfied that the draft agreement strikes a fair balance between rightful concerns to protect personal privacy and the need to increase air security for all passengers across the Atlantic. The Commission is working towards making a proposal by this summer which will outline the EU approach to the use of travellers' data for border and aviation security and other law enforcement purposes. Such a policy framework will need to strike a balance between security concerns and civil liberties.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">The Commission is also launching an initiative to create a multilateral framework for PNR data transfer under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO. The Commission will pursue co-operation with airlines, travel agents, central reservations systems and data protection authorities to ensure that passengers are fully and accurately informed when purchasing their tickets about the uses that are made of their PNR data. This is the up to date position.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">Is it envisaged that the association agreement with Syria will be signed in the near future? I also have a question regarding African capacities for peacekeeping and crisis management, but it is all right if the Minister of State does not have the information readily available. Are only some African countries involved in peacekeeping and are these countries seen as providing forces for all of Africa or only trouble spots? I will understand if the information is not to hand.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">The issue is that of weapons of mass destruction. I am aware of differing views among various members. The Irish Presidency, as usual, is trying to achieve a consensus of views but this looks unlikely, given the file on the issue. We will try for agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">I join the Chairman and other members in thanking the Minister of State for his attendance. I wish to ask some questions about the Middle East peace process. The euroMed summit was held in Dublin Castle on 5 and 6 May. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, attended the meeting. The euroMed process is one of the few areas in which the Palestinians and the Israelis sit down side by side and that is to be welcomed. I recently attended the inaugural parliamentary assembly of the euroMed process which was held in Athens.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">As part of the terms of membership criteria for the Barcelona process, a country must be committed to human rights. The wall being constructed by Israel has been condemned by many human rights groups and the UN, as far as I am aware. I remain one of those who believe that Israel should be part of the Barcelona process; it is very important that it sits down beside neighbours with which it is in conflict. I believe there is leverage under the human rights terms of membership of the Barcelona process that can be used to say to Israel that the wall is completely unacceptable and is denying basic and fundamental human rights to the Palestinian community. Has the Minister of State any plans to use those terms of membership to exert pressure on Israel to reconsider this wall and to halt its construction? It would be remiss of Ireland if some leverage was not used to make that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">All in a good cause. I am pleased to see Kosovo is on the agenda for the meeting and that the Council will be handling the issue carefully. I wonder whether anyone has thought through what will be the end game in the case of Kosovo. Subject to all sorts of issues about multi-ethnic Kosovo being resolved, will there be an independent Kosovo?</p>
          <p eId="para_53">I have the impression of a very poor country or region where there does not seem to be any other sensible, long-term resolution.

Will he say where Iraq is placed on the agenda? Will it be discussed over lunch? It does not appear on the formal agenda. The Minister of State will be aware that I raised the issue of Sudan and the genocide of the people in western Sudan by the Government of Sudan. What action is being taken by the European Union Council of Ministers to address that issue?</p>

          <from>Deputy Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_55">On the question regarding the Middle East raised by Deputy Mulcahy, I did not attend those meetings of euroMed. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, was at the centre of the Quartet. The Quartet has done very useful work which lays out the type of structure regarding the road map. The Quartet met in New York and Ireland was represented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mr. Solana and Mr. Chris Patten also attended. In a statement following the meeting the Quartet reaffirms the road map and the commitment to a negotiated two state solution. It also calls for a comprehensive ceasefire and renewed progress towards peace. It notes the Gaza disengagement plan could be a rare moment of opportunity in the search for peace. However, the statement also makes it clear there needs to be a full withdrawal consistent with the road map; a deeper commitment and engagement by the Quartet, including a more visible presence on the ground. The Quartet meeting was timely and demonstrates that it continues to play an active role in pursuing the goal of a comprehensive regional peace settlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">The Minister met the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Shalom, in Dublin at the euroMed meeting. He reiterated the Union's wish for the separation of the two walls and called for Israel to implement the road map. With regard to the Israeli separation barrier, Europe cannot accept that a separation barrier built on Palestinian land would best serve Israel's long-term security needs. The European Council has expressed its concern for the route envisaged for the separation barrier and the departure of that route from the green line in the West Bank. The appropriation of land in the West Bank or Gaza is illegal and contrary to international law and the restrictions associated with the separation barrier are having a detrimental effect on Palestinian society. That is the Irish position.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Deputy Haughey asked about the European neighbourhood policy. The main aim of the policy, which we very much support as Presidency, is to create a ring of friends, an enlarged area of peace and prosperity encompassing neighbours to the east and south based on shared values or common and converging interests. The three principal elements of the emerging policy are the adoption by the Commission of a neighbourhood strategy paper, the preparation of action plans for each partner country and the development of new instruments to support the implementation of the goals of the action plans. It is expected that the Commission will adopt the neighbourhood strategy plan at the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">The purpose of the action plans is to realise the objectives of the European neighbourhood policy. They should give momentum to the full implementation of the existing partnership and co-operation agreements between these countries and the EU, together with other related commitments. It is only right, especially post-enlargement, that we should have a solid, structured relationship with neighbouring countries. We see this as a very positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Deputy O'Keeffe spoke about Kosovo. The EU supports fully the efforts of the UN mission there and will continue to work closely with the special representative of the UN Secretary General, Harri Holkeri, to ensure full implementation of the UN resolution. I agree with the Deputy that it is right that this is on the agenda. As holder of the Presidency, Ireland is ensuring there is a clear EU voice on the way forward. The EU is firmly committed to a multi-ethnic Kosovo. Member states are agreed that the immediate priorities must be to ensure security, reconstruct property destroyed in the recent violence and bring those responsible to justice. Local political leaders must take responsibility and adopt urgently practical measures to demonstrate their continuing commitment to a multi-ethnic Kosovo.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">The EU supports the UN mission's policy of standards before status. It is our bottom-line position. It is essential to reinvigorate and strengthen the policy. I welcome the publication of the Kosovo standards implementation plan on 31 March which sets out the actions and policies necessary to reach the eight standards required in the UN's standards before status policy. We continue to hope there will be sufficient action on implementation to facilitate a comprehensive review in May 2005 of progress towards meeting the standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">While it is not planned to discuss Iraq at this month's Council, it's important to make some reference to events there at the beginning of this meeting. The Chairman and I have discussed the issue of Sudan previously. As I have said, Sudan was on the agenda when I was Minister of State with responsibility for development in the early 1990s. It remains on the agenda. Events in Darfur are truly terrible. There is great human suffering and we are very involved in addressing the conflict. I attended talks in Nairobi as part of a troika some months ago which went well. We have been making efforts to improve circumstances in Darfur. While the ceasefire is tenuous, we will continue to make every effort to ensure that fighting is brought to an end. The sub-committee can be sure that Sudan is very much a priority for our Presidency. We have been as active as possible on it and will certainly continue to be as active as the sub-committee would wish.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">I repeat the condemnation by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, of the bomb attack in Grozny in which the Chechen President was killed. As the Minister said, no political cause can justify terrorism. There is agreement within the EU that respect for human rights is an essential element of the EU-Russia relationship. The EU has continuing and genuine concerns about terrorist attacks, human rights violations and humanitarian issues in Chechnya. The EU welcomes Russia's efforts to find a political settlement of the conflict in Chechnya. Russia and the EU share the objective of a durable settlement with respect to Russia's territorial integrity and the support and confidence of the Chechen population. The issue is on the Council agenda and will be discussed towards the end of the meeting.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">It would be useful to be brought up to date on the issue of the hand-over to the provisional authority on 30 June. It is clear from what we have learned in the last few weeks that the sooner the better all foreign powers leave Iraq, subject to the introduction of a proper system of government. Nobody would like to see the 30 June deadline slip away. Can the Minister of State make a note that the EU Presidency should underline the view that the deadline should not be missed? There has been no mention of it on the international scene in the past week or two. I am wondering if a rethink is happening on that issue. It should be brought up at the Council and 30 June date should be underlined. If the hand-over does not happen, the situation will fall deeper into the abyss.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">The Deputy will be aware that Mr. Brahimi, special adviser to Secretary General Kofi Annan, said the UN was confident that an Iraqi caretaker government could be formed ahead of the transfer of powers at the end of June to guide the country until free and fair elections are held in January 2005. I agree with the Deputy that a timetable is in place for hand-over to an Iraqi administration on 30 June. We want to see a calm and orderly transfer. The EU is ready to provide assistance for the Iraqi administration to move from an interim authority to representative elections in 2005. A new UN resolution will be required to accomplish that. We have heard what Mr. Brahimi has had to say and the EU is committed to supporting the UN in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">We have asked the high representative and the Commission to continue their work on a medium-term strategy which will set out how the European Union can play a role in support of the political process and reconstruction in Iraq.

          <p eId="para_69">The Defence Ministers will attend with Foreign Ministers as I attended the last Council in my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for development. The Thessaloníki Council charged the appropriate bodies of the EU to undertake necessary actions to create in the course of 2004 an intergovernmental agency in the fields of defence capability development, research, acquisition and armaments. The agency is open to participation by all member states and is being established primarily to act in support of Common Foreign and Security Policy and European Security and Defence Policy objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">Its main aim is to support member states' efforts to support the EU's defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy and develop it further. The agency should help to ensure that the defence forces of EU states are properly equipped, suitably inter-operable and capable of carrying out crisis management missions, not least from the perspective of protecting the forces themselves as well as those they may be trying to help. It should be noted that the agency is also envisaged in the draft treaty on the constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">Work to create the agency has been taken forward by an agency establishment team, or AET, composed of experts. The team has completed its work and recently presented proposals to member states' representatives. The current state of play will be reviewed by Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence at the May and June Councils. It remains to be finalised whether the prospective joint action creating the agency will be adopted before the end of the Irish Presidency.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">During a visit to Liberia, I was proud to note the quality of the Army's equipment and its professionalism generally. The new European Defence Agency will be important because it will advise on procurement and ensure that the Army has the best type of equipment available, which is in everybody's interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">I will give an example of the role of the Irish Army in Liberia. Its presence, its professionalism and the fact that it is well equipped meant that there was humanitarian space for non-governmental organisations to be involved in vaccine programmes for measles, for example. I observed at first hand that the NGOs were able to travel outside Monrovia.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">The work of the agency will be positive in that it will improve cost efficiency in developing a capability for crisis management. This can be achieved by addressing in a co-ordinated manner the need to reduce inefficient and fragmented spending and duplication which characterises defence expenditure in Europe.
