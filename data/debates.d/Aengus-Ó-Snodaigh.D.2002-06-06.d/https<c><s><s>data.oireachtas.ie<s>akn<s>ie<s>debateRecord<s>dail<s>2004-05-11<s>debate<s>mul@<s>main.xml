            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_7">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">Since I last reported to the House, there have been two meetings of the cross-departmental team on housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships, the most recent having taken place on 19 April 2004. The discussions at that meeting were focused on the non-funding aspects of infrastructure delivery, most notably in the project management and legal areas, and on options for acceleration of the national roads programme. The team will undertake further work on the issues involved with a view to developing a composite set of proposals for the next meeting of the team on 9 June. A special emphasis will be given to the further steps that can be taken towards securing speedier and better value for money outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">The team met previously on 3 March. The principal agenda item was the education capital programme, which is now included in the remit of the team. The Department of Education and Science gave a detailed presentation on the programme, covering the primary, post-primary and third-level sectors. The focus was on the outputs achieved to date and the plans and priorities over the period to 2008. It is intended that the Cabinet committee and the supporting cross-departmental team will meet each month over the remainder of the year, with the exceptions of May and August owing to EU Presidency commitments and the holiday period respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">Overall, a major acceleration in delivery of key national infrastructure has occurred in recent times. That is clear from the fifth progress report of the team that was published at the end of April and lodged in the Oireachtas Library. The overriding aim is to maintain that momentum over the remaining lifetime of the national development plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">Many people would be interested to know if the legislation on the national infrastructure board, which relates to public private partnerships, will be published before the local and European Parliament elections. It is designed primarily for the fast-tracking of incinerators, power stations, motorways and so on but has it been discussed at Cabinet? It was reported to have been discussed at, or at least to have been coming before, Cabinet by the end of last month. Will the Taoiseach give us an up-to-date position on it? Has he taken into account the opposition to the Bill on the basis that local government, on which we will, ironically, decide on 11 June, will have less power as a result of it? Is that the reason it is not being brought forward before the local elections as seems to be the case?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_12">The matter has not yet been discussed at Cabinet. The Ministers directly involved are to have some discussions on it. I think it will be the autumn before the Bill comes before the House.</p>

            <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_13">Was the media report that the Bill was to come before Cabinet last month completely wrong? Is it not ready or is it being reconsidered? Does the Taoiseach believe there is a need to look again at the policies on incineration and at many of the other problems? The amount of waste has grown 60% since 1997 when the Taoiseach took office. Recycling is only at 12%. Rather than going forward with this legislation, is there not a need to look at the bigger picture to try to ensure maximum support and some type of consensus on it?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_14">The Minister would want to get maximum support. Many comments have been made about the Bill. I do not know if the Minister has met the individual groups. The Deputy would need to table a question to him. The Bill is intended to deal, in a moderate way, with projects where there would be delays apart from the normal process. Where the normal process operates, there is no reason for projects to be fast-tracked. We must consider what those areas are. I know from previous discussions we should consider it only in limited areas rather than more broadly. There was some debate around that and I am sure the Minister will take account of the views in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">As the Deputy is aware, many others have made the point that there are considerable delays with major projects. In a number of projects, people have made the point that they have not met the same levels of bureaucracy and delay elsewhere, whether in Northern Ireland or in the UK. It is necessary to strike a balance and to try to ensure that while we get the necessary investments and make the necessary progress in these areas, it is done in a way that reflects the normal laws and that there is proper discussion. I do not think the Minister is trying to do anything other than to try to ensure we have major projects and that there is a process to deal with them quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">Deputy Sargent knows as well as I do that there is much annoyance among some people who have large investments, who try to comply with environmental laws and with everything the Environmental Protection Agency sets out and who go through the planning process but where in the last few days before a decision, somebody comes back and asks for more information which sets them back several further months. That is frustrating, whether it is right or wrong. It is some process that does not endanger investment and decisions by people who are complying with the law and are prepared to comply with every local and national Government regulation, but still get delayed for long periods. Regrettably, there are many such cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_17">To what extent does the Cabinet committee address housing issues? For example, does it have dedicated meetings that address solely the housing crisis? Does it address the range of housing issues including the dire need for more social housing and the need to address seriously the massive profiteering that is taking place within the housing market, which is still driving house prices astronomically high and out of the reach of many ordinary workers?</p>
            <p eId="para_18">Will the Taoiseach ask the committee and the cross-departmental team to address the housing needs of people with disabilities? The Taoiseach will be aware that the Disability Federation of Ireland published a local government programme this morning. Deputy Séamus Kirk represented the Taoiseach and his party at that event. The federation highlighted the dire accommodation needs of a raft of people involved in the disability sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_21">Will the Taoiseach also ask the committee to address the need to reform completely the disabled person's housing grant, to which I referred this morning in Croke Park, including a national standard and 100% coverage of the work to be carried out for the disabled applicant? These changes have not only been recommended by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities but, as any Member of the House will know, they are required for those in greatest need.</p>

            <p eId="para_22">The Deputy should table to the relevant Minister a question about the disabled person's maintenance grant. On the cross-departmental team, yes, it discusses housing issues and receives housing reports from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, as well as dealing with the programme for social and affordable housing. This year, approximately €1.8 billion has been spent on social and affordable housing. During the life of the national development plan, in the order of €5.25 billion will be spent on social and affordable housing. The cross-departmental team is continually endeavouring to increase social, affordable and voluntary housing capacity. If the Deputy has any further detailed questions in this regard, he should table them to the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">The Taoiseach referred to both social and affordable housing, and, while he did not answer a number of questions I put to him, I will conclude with a specific point. Real concern was expressed at this morning's conference in Croke Park that there is a question mark over the provision of social housing through the local authority network, throughout this jurisdiction, given the Government's policy and intent. I invite the Taoiseach to use this opportunity to allay those fears and indicate his Government's commitment to the continued provision of social housing as a priority project of local government in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">Most of the expenditure has been on social housing. Practically the entire budget in that area has been on social housing. Last year, 5,000 houses were finished and this year just short of 5,000 have been started. There has been major expenditure on social housing. In the short period of the national development plan, more than €5 billion has been spent on the area. That spending will continue for the lifetime of the plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">Reports indicate that the lack of a second terminal at Dublin Airport is costing the country substantial sums in lost tourism revenue. The Department of Transport received at least 13 independent proposals to build a second terminal for Dublin Airport. When does the Taoiseach expect that a decision will be reached on this matter of critical importance to the development of the city and the economy?</p>
            <p eId="para_30">When does the Taoiseach expect the critical infrastructure Bill to deal specifically with the development of a metro system from Dublin city centre to the airport will be published? Has the Cabinet considered the issue? Is a timescale envisaged? Does the Taoiseach expect that the metro project to which the Minister for Transport referred will have commenced or will be up and running by 2007?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_17">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_31">There has been much discussion of a proposal for a second terminal at Dublin Airport and the form it should take — whether it should be independent or an Aer Rianta terminal and whether it should be low cost or of a more substantive nature because the construction costs and format for each will be different. Those discussions are ongoing with the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">The case has been made that a second terminal would attract many extra visitors and generate employment. There were 13 proposals, some of which were detailed while others outlined financial injections of capital that did not describe the organisation and running of the project. The Minister must reach a final decision on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_33">There are also industrial relations difficulties. Aer Rianta staff are opposed to the concept of an entirely independent terminal outside the remit of the airport. They feel that would introduce differing employment status. Discussions to reconcile this issue are part of the reason for a delay in reaching a conclusion. From looking at the presentations, however, it should be possible to reach agreement, especially if staff are unionised because that would remove many of the difficulties. I have stated that in meetings between the various parties to the arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">A second terminal would require substantial investment and Aer Rianta is not in such a healthy financial position that it can do without the extra business. The Minister will come forward with a solution when the discussions are completed, although I am not sure at what stage they are now.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">The original cost structures drawn up by the Rail Procurement Agency for a metro to Dublin Airport were extremely high. The Minister engaged in discussions with the Spanish authorities, who had carried out this work on a much less expensive basis, and the RPA has resubmitted the plan on that basis. The plan prioritises a light rail system from the city to the airport and discussions are continuing on how best to build it — by PPP or otherwise. It is still a very costly project and it is probably only feasible on a PPP basis because it would otherwise require a huge percentage of the overall capital spending programme for the next few years.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">That would leave the State open to the difficulties of having the project there, which would take money from other projects if it were not on a PPP basis. Of course, if it were on a PPP basis, it would have to fulfil EUROSTAT rules that the weight of involvement and risk be transferred to the private sector. However, those matters are being considered by the Minister. No decision has yet been made on whether to go ahead with it, but the Minister is completing his report. Before he brings forward a proposal, he is continuing to communicate with the Spanish authorities because of their success.</p>

            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_37">The Taoiseach has expressed his frustration at the delay in many infrastructural projects, and that is shared by the House, given the very slow delivery, the extent of need and the infrastructural deficit. In light of the fact that the NRA has discovered yet another archaeological find of considerable importance to heritage, perhaps the time has come to examine its composition. Has the Taoiseach given that any thought? With Carrickmines, Tara, and now Waterford, it is beginning to look like the NRA has an unerring instinct for building roads across heritage sites. Is it not time, rather than condemning snails as the Taoiseach has been doing — I have some sympathy in that regard — we consider why engineering and other expertise cannot construct a section of motorway around the hill of Tara rather than through it? They chose a site in Waterford for the proposed road, seemingly deliberately, where, according to Professor Donchadh Ó Corráin and other experts, one would have anticipated an archaeological find of some significance. Is it not time to examine that?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_19">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_38">I find it hard to argue against Deputy Rabbitte on this. While the country is very rich in archaeological sites and monuments, it seems extraordinary that, in many of our major projects, we seem to find such locations. Carrickmines is a good example of our going through the entire process and the examination without there seeming to be a difficulty. It was at the end of the process that the problem arose. If I recall correctly, the Carrickmines process took 32 years from the start of the road, and the issues arose only very late. However, in Tara and other areas, people should examine such issues at the preliminary stage. I accept the Deputy's point.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">Recently, I asked at a meeting why, everywhere we looked, we seemed to find archaeological delays. An official answered me that when one spends €100 million on archaeology, one tends to have a great many people looking, who in turn tend to find a great deal. That is part of the difficulty too. However, it seems that the archaeological checks should be done at the very earliest stages of identification. We looked elsewhere with the Spanish issue. I have no reason to put roads through national monuments or other buildings of heritage value.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">However, it seems that difficulties arise, if not with a building or monument, with a plant or snail. On many other sites where archaeological digs are conducted, people get over problems and find ways of dealing with them. I do not know at what precise stage the engineers check these issues. It should be done when the land is purchased. It is always when we get to the end of the design or planning, when we are far into the process, that it happens. I do not want to guess when the archaeological dig is started, but it should be at land purchase stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">At a meeting recently I was going through a long list of road projects. In practically all of them archaeological work of one kind or another was required. Important buildings and archaeological sites deserve to be protected and I am not against that. However, it appears extraordinary when something of archaeological importance is attached to almost every single item on a list comprising some 25 or 26 projects. That looks as if people are using the scheme for particular advantage. It is significant that the archaeological profession is one of the fastest growing areas of employment in the country. I do not believe matters have changed so radically in the last decade to justify this level of expansion.</p>

            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_44">There is some truth in that. I would be somewhat worried, however, if that is the official advice available to the Taoiseach. As in the Tara case, there are groups who advise the National Roads Authority in advance that if it decides to plough through the hill of Tara it will be likely to come across something of some significance. One does not need to be an archaeological scholar to suspect that this might be borne out to be true. Sometimes the longest way around is the shortest time home. The Taoiseach should attempt to answer the question, which was whether he contemplated any changes in the National Roads Authority as a result of what is not a distinguished record to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">On the same theme, will the Taoiseach say, in respect of the interdepartmental team on infrastructure and public private partnerships — when all of these grand titles are disposed of as well as the meetings to which he refers — is it not the case that PPPs have not really got off the ground, some five or six years later, in Ireland? When will there be some clarity as to whether PPPs provide the answer to some of our infrastructural need? My advice is that there is a paralysis within the official system in terms of the desire to make PPPs work. I do not believe they are appropriate in all circumstances — far from it. However, it seems there may be circumstances where they could make a significant contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">I do not deride the official desire to protect the taxpayer and so on. However, there seems to be an attitude, "If we do not make a decision at all, we will not make a mistake." It is also desirable to slow down projects. That is a saving for the State. This is assisted by official policy because that is the attitude of the Government: reverse engines after elections, slow spending, try to get the electoral and business cycles into kilter. Surely we have passed the age when slowing something down is considered to be for our economic benefit. Will the Taoiseach agree that the absence of progress on infrastructural projects is a constraint on our future economic potential? Is there any sign of a template coming out of these meetings of the interdepartmental committee that will clarify how PPPs are supposed to work?</p>
            <p eId="para_47">My understanding is that a large amount of private sector capital is currently looking for a home. It will locate elsewhere if we cannot use it here. There have even been circumstances where the National Pensions Reserve Fund or the National Treasury Management Agency nominated a small amount, €200 million, more than a year ago for projects and it has not yet been taken up. There are no projects being put forward to use the money. There is €10.5 billion in the fund building bridges in Tokyo, New York and so on. Will the Taoiseach tell the House how we can reconcile a situation whereby all sides agree on the serious infrastructural deficit, there is significant money there to do the work but for some reason, whether lack of project expertise, official paralysis or whatever, we do not seem to be able to get the formula right?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_23">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_48">I accept the Deputy's point that the NRA should look at these things early on. People make the point that it should be cautious in Tara, which is obvious, but the issue comes up in other areas and archaeological digs are necessary. I will raise the matter about the early identification of the work again with the interdepartmental team.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">Many roads are being developed under PPPs. Every time we discuss PPPs numerous Deputies raise ideological objections to the concept. I have explained several times the advice of the Department of Finance and the National Treasury Management Agency on this issue. The EUROSTAT decision earlier this year clarified the issue and there have been explanations and meetings with the investors. The problem with the EUROSTAT count was that the capital costs of a project were counted up front in the general Government deficit, even when the risk was transferred to the private sector, which was unacceptable. We won that argument and that was good for the PPP process. The Department has issued new guidelines which are lengthy as they must be under EUROSTAT laws, but they are understood. IBEC and the construction industry say that people understand the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">I reject what the Deputy says about the capital programme. Of the roads due to be completed this year almost 80 km. are complete, 150 km. are under construction and another 155 km. are to start. Those figures represent a significant advance on the position two or three years ago. Many of these are PPPs, such as the section of the 11 km. Dundalk-western bypass leading to the Border, the Fermoy bypass, the Waterford road, the Kilcock-Kinnegad route which is by far the longest stretch at 38 km., and several others. The private sector is interested only in PPPs that offer a commercial return, which is understandable but also explains the failure to take them up. In the case of roads and most other infrastructural projects that involves a toll and the private sector is interested only in areas and roads that carry the volumes of traffic that can yield a commercial return.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">The private sector view of these issues is very conservative. I was in the Department of Finance when the M50 opened and the view was that it would not be viable and would not hold. The first and second quarter figures showed it was not very viable. That was the end of that story but there was considerable debate, worry and concern about it and that attitude persists. When the national development plan was first launched there was a view that people from the National Treasury Management Agency and the IFSC would be waiting to take up these projects but they are not interested in most construction projects. There has been some concern from those outside the country who showed an interest but found great difficulty in operating the project and there was much criticism here of the five schools that we used early on. The company involved in that project found the negative opinion of the public, the media, local authorities and many in this House, unhelpful. By and large it pulled back from the operation it had begun here. Neither did the private sector find it attractive to take the same level of risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_52">The rules are very clear if people are prepared to invest their resources. Following the EUROSTAT change, where the risk is transferred, the international rules are both clear and transparent. The previous process was a silly one but it has been changed. Where the risk is transferred, the resources are not counted in. Not too many are prepared to take that on. Many private sector companies want the return but not to have the risk transferred. They cannot have it that way.</p>

            <p eId="para_53">My advice is that the Department of Finance, notwithstanding the EUROSTAT ruling, stills wants to frontload the structuring of the proposal in such a fashion that it is not attractive to elements of the private sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">If the Deputy takes the case of the 38 km. of the Kilcock-Kinnegad road, there was no difficulty, either with the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, local authorities or the private sector. They went for it because it was a substantial project with high volumes of traffic. When it comes to water or sewerage, other than the project with which Deputy Quinn is familiar that he and I attended last year and in which there was private investment, by and large, people do not opt to invest in these projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">I support public private partnerships, but I have said to IBEC that the private sector must accept the international rules that it must carry the risk. It cannot ask the State and the taxpayer to pay a premium to carry the risk and then say it is against PPPs if they do not. That is the difficulty with private sector investors. They want the State to carry the risk. They want to invest money and be assured that, if something goes wrong, they are covered. They cannot do it that way. That is the reason we have been slower than expected.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">From talking to members of the British Government, it appears that many of the roads in the early PPP projects are not as good. The argument in that respect is perhaps that they jumped in, gave too much out and undermined much of their own public sector issues. It is a different argument; I do not think it is a reason for not using PPPs, which we use in a substantial number of areas. I am aware that the Department continues to use them. Some of the education projects for this year will also be PPPs. I know there was great difficulty arguing out the transfer of risk issue.</p>

            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_57">Following on from Deputy Rabbitte's question about archaeological finds, it is my understanding that the Minister, on behalf of the Government, retains policy in terms of road development and also the allocation of money to the National Roads Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">When I was Opposition spokesman on arts and heritage, I learned from archaeologists that they do not mind as long as they have the opportunity to excavate and record what is found. The strip analysis is done a long time before road development takes place. Once a line becomes clear, it is perfectly feasible for them to determine early on if there is a strong likelihood of important archaeological finds being discovered.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">Professor Séamus Caulfield informed me that there are 100 years' worth of excavations at Rath Cruachan, County Roscommon. It seems to be sacrilegious to drive a motorway through the Hill of Tara. One day while driving to Dublin I heard a National Roads Authority spokesman on the radio state adamantly that there would be no change, irrespective of the feelings or sensitivities not just of the people living in the area but elsewhere in the country. The Hill of Tara means something to everybody in Ireland. Does Government policy allow for this to be taken into account by the National Roads Authority?</p>
            <p eId="para_60">With regard to the list of projects the Taoiseach read, I do not understand why when the Government allocated moneys under the national development plan for major infrastructure in 2002, 2003 and 2004, no funding was allocated for any major road structure west of the Shannon. There was some funding for a stretch of motorway on the way to Dundalk, which is included in the BMW region, but that is a long way removed from beyond Termonbarry. When I was travelling up here at 2.30 a.m. this morning, I drove on the new stretch of road, opened yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, from Strokestown to Termonbarry, about eight kilometres in distance, through virgin bog, which is a good development.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">Why is the NRA, which was set up by Government, unable to get its act together in having projects ready in terms of the use of expenditure allocated to particular regions? When one contacts the NRA, one is told that such projects do not have priority and their completion is ten, 12 or 15 years down the line, which makes a mockery of balanced regional economic development. Following Deputy Rabbitte's comment about the NRA, this is something the Government could usefully examine.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_27">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_62">I heard what the Deputy said about the archaeological issues. Obviously if one takes a sensitive site or route and tries to force a project through it, one will run into difficulties. The NRA is independent in its examination of these projects and it must go through a process of examination. As to a Department or Minister dictating a route, obviously the Minister responsible has an involvement and when difficulties arise the matter always comes back to him or her. Sometimes the issue may be the costs involved and, as Deputy Rabbitte said, going the long way around can be costly.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">I hold the view that the Deputy should not look for trouble — at least we are trying to find routes that are acceptable and unlikely to give rise to issues. It seems that every time a road is proposed in an area, people object to it. I am not blaming the archaeologists for doing their jobs. They come in and, in many cases, carry out checks, and if nothing is found they move on, but that does not stop people protesting or continuing such protests.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">On the issue of priorities, as Deputy Kenny knows, a number of projects west of the Shannon are designed to link up with the Dublin-Sligo, Dublin-Galway and Dublin-Limerick routes. The Dublin-Galway route, in particular, is one the Minister has made a priority, with the Kinnegad motorway, the second part of the motorway link to Athlone and, on the other side, the Loughrea bypass linking the motorway back to Galway — the same is the case with the road to Sligo. Probably some of the best motorways that have been finished go through the Curlews——</p>

            <p eId="para_66">——and the Strokestown-Longford motorway is under construction. These are all significant roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">It is best if work on these projects continues. As I said before, if we can keep expenditure on such projects to about 5% of GDP and having regard to roads that will be completed this year and the roads under construction, we will have in the order of way more than 400 km of new roadway. If that level of road construction is maintained for a period, that will mean that the NRA will have to keep that level of construction up to the end of this decade. From the figures in the Department of Finance for such projects up to the end of the decade — the figures cover a five or seven year period — it should be possible to keep such expenditure to 5% of GDP and, if that can be done, a huge impact can be made on the motorway status of roads not only on the east coast and in the midlands but also on the west coast.</p>
            <p eId="para_68">There is also the Ballina-Bohola road project, in respect of which I am not sure if work has started, but it is also a priority. As Deputy Kenny knows, business people and members of the public are demanding that priority be given to the Galway-Limerick route because they think that link is enormously important. These are priorities the Cabinet committee on infrastructure has put to the NRA as being crucial for balanced economic and regional development in the western region, not to mind projects elsewhere in the country.</p>

            <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_69">I am anxious to follow up on the reply the Taoiseach gave to a question on a PPP when he mentioned the rules being clear across the EU and that the pitfalls, conditions and so forth should be obvious to anybody getting involved. Is he not concerned that when the Audit Commission in the UK reported about schools built under public private partnerships, it indicated that the costs involved could be as much as 24% more than schools built using more traditional financing methods? Is the Taoiseach in a position to state that this would not happen in Ireland or that there would be no repeat here of an incident such as that which occurred in East Lothian last year when a PPP consortium went bust and the school in question was effectively raided and pupils' books, computers, etc., were seized in lieu of payment? Is it not the case that this is one of the risks of PPPs and that the Government cannot deny it?</p>

            <p eId="para_70">Will the Taoiseach also comment on the provision of five schools by the Jarvis company? Prior to the opening of these in recent years, concerns were raised by several Deputies in respect of the standard of workmanship and the standard of future maintenance. I am familiar with one of the schools which is situated in my constituency and all the concerns to which I refer have been realised. The vocational education committee responsible for providing education at the facility in question is concerned about the standard thereof. Is this not a major concern for the Government in terms of school building provision?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_73">I am not aware of the position in that regard. I am aware that issues were raised. I return to the question I posed earlier, namely, whether one gets a good return on one's investment. As I have explained on numerous occasions, the Department of Finance has stated that as regards the capital programmes for education or health, the cheapest money is that invested by the State. However, that does not always mean that projects will be completed quickly. It is not possible to do everything and that is why we have been slower than others in advancing the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">As regards the five schools to which the Deputy referred, I would be disappointed if Jarvis was not honouring its commitment. I understand that a 20 or 25 year maintenance contract formed part of the agreement reached with the company. These schools were only completed approximately three years ago and, therefore, I am sure they are still under guarantee and warranty.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">I return to the argument about the risk involved. The private sector wants the State to carry the risk, while the Department of Finance has argued — as have the treasuries in the UK and other countries — that the State does not obtain good value in such circumstances. On projects involving road building, private sector interests can carry the risk and obtain a return. If we follow that policy, charges and tolls will be imposed and this affects the public. If we are going to modernise the country in terms of developing roads, the rail network, airport facilities and the water and sewerage infrastructure and do so within a particular period, some of the work can be transferred to the private sector. That policy has been successful in certain instances, such as, for example, the sewerage project at Ringsend and particular road projects. I am not familiar with the details of the education project but I will raise the Deputy's concerns with the relevant Minister.</p>

        if he has authorised an investigation into the role played by members of the Western Command during the Battle of Jadotville in the Congo in 1961; the terms of reference of such an investigation; when he expects a final report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_35">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_77">The Chief of Staff has received a submission from a retired Army officer who served at Jadotville seeking a review of the events of September 1961. The Chief of Staff has arranged for the submission to be examined by a board of military officers. The Chief of Staff has asked the board to make recommendations as to any further action that may be open. Pending the outcome of the examination, it would not be appropriate for me to comment. I will carefully consider any recommendations that the Chief of Staff may make in respect of the issue.</p>

          <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_36">
            <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_78">I am glad the Minister has informed us that the case is being reopened after 43 years. Does the Minister agree that the essential elements of the matter are simple and straightforward, namely, that a company of the Irish Defence Forces, under severe attack by 4,000 Katanganese soldiers led by Belgian officers, sustained the attack for five days? They were outnumbered by 20 to one and during the five days inflicted casualties of 300 on the enemy forces without sustaining any fatality themselves, though seven were injured. They withstood the land and air bombardment for five days until, eventually, their ammunition, food and water ran out. The <i>Daily Mail</i>, that organ of rectitude, reported afterwards that they fought like tigers.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">Now, 43 years later, their valour and heroism has been almost airbrushed out of Irish military history. Unfortunately, quite a few of up to 350 Irish people who fought at that battle have gone to their eternal reward without recognition of their bravery. I hope that when this inquiry is established it will report back as soon as possible because some of the participants of the Jadotville siege are now in their 80s or 90s and others have died. These people are not looking for money or compensation but for recognition of how bravely they fought and held the fort for five days, until they eventually had to surrender. I would term it the Irish Thermopylae.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">I hope there is a comprehensive review, that justice is done and that their valour and heroism is recognised, even 43 years later. I also hope we get some indication as to what mysterious forces were at work which prevented recognition of their valour and bravery for 43 years. This is not how our Defence Forces should be treated. We are proud of what they have done on international service with the United Nations. This battle was a glorious occasion but it has been forgotten. I hope the inquiry addresses that.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_37" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_81">As I indicated, the Chief of Staff has established a board of military officers to examine the matter. It would not be fair or right for me to comment further beyond saying that the military board sets about its work in an independent manner, without interference from me or anybody else and there is sound reason for that. Recognition of distinctive roles — medals of honour, military stars or whatever recognition it is finally decided should be accorded, in this or any other case, is done on the basis of strict criterion with which I would not interfere.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">However, I would like to respond to Deputy McGinley's request and have the process completed as quickly as possible to facilitate whatever decisions must be taken on foot of it. I will certainly respond quickly to whatever recommendations are made to me.</p>

We should recognise and record the perseverance of people like John Gorman and others, who are still thankfully alive and who participated in that siege. They too hope that no further time is wasted, that there is no foot dragging and that the truth comes out and is officially recognised. I hope the Minister will maintain his interest in the inquiry and ensure this happens.</p>

        [13659/04]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_40" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_87">I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 107 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">The most important defence against a terrorist attack is detection and prevention by the security forces. While the Garda Síochána has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice, to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána. The various components of the Defence Forces are active in this regard, providing such assistance as is appropriate in specific circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">A key issue in detection and prevention is the availability and effective analysis of information and intelligence. The likelihood of a terrorist threat to Ireland is being continually assessed and there is ongoing contact and very good co-operation between the Garda and the Defence Forces in this regard. The advice available to me suggests that there is no reason to believe at this time that Ireland or Irish airspace is a direct target. However, it is prudent that we take precautions and keep matters under continuous review.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">The assets available to the Defence Forces are related to the level of threat and are considered appropriate in this regard. An air defence capability requires the integrated use of aircraft, radar and air and ground based weapons systems. The Defence Forces have a limited ground-to-air capacity, and that has always been the position. The new trainer aircraft will enhance the airborne elements of our air defence capability. However, we will still continue to operate a limited air-to-air and air-to-ground defence capability.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">The Air Corps has a total of 21 fixed wing aircraft and 15 helicopters in the fleet. Outside that it would be inappropriate of me to go into detail about the readiness, deployment arrangements or speed of deployment or redeployment of air defence assets. However, all aircraft have adequate numbers of operationally trained aircrew who can operate from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, which is available on a 24 hour basis as required, and that the shortest call-out time applicable in the Air Corps in certain circumstances is two minutes.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">The role of the Pilatus aircraft being acquired for the Air Corps is as a pilot trainer aircraft to train Air Corps pilots in basic flying and in air combat techniques. The aircraft can also be armed with machine guns and rocket systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_94">The Defence Forces have one Giraffe mobile air defence radar with a range of up to 40 km and eight Flycatcher mobile air defence fire control radars with a range of 20 km. Twenty-four Bofors L70 air defence guns were purchased from the Royal Netherlands Air Force following the events of 11 September 2001. These weapons are controlled directly by the Flycatcher radars. The projected capability of these guns allows for the simultaneous protection of four airports plus a reserve. The Defence Forces also have six Bofors RBS missile launchers for use with the Giraffe radar. The radar systems have the capacity to detect overflights by aircraft and the air defence regiment is fully trained in the use of the guns. The weapons systems on the new Pilatus aircraft will provide a further capability in terms of air defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">Ireland has traditionally had a limited military air capability. Aspirations to broaden the range of available air based capabilities are understandable but have to be balanced against real world constraints. Given the enormous costs involved, few small countries possess the ability to provide a comprehensive air based defence capability. The choice must then lie between maintaining an essentially token force to address all dimensions of national defence or seeking to perform a selected range of tasks to a professional standard. The latter option has been the one chosen in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_96">Before dealing with the question, I pay tribute to Air Corps Second Lieutenant Raymond Heery who lost his life when his plane crashed during a training exercise last week. This emphasises once again the risks we ask members of the Defence Forces to take for us on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">Given that the Air Corps has been so short of aircraft, the acquisition of the Pilatus aircraft is a welcome development. What is the total value of the contract and when will the rest of the aircraft be delivered? Does the Minister accept that these aircraft are, effectively, only suitable for training purposes and that they have no real defensive capacity in the accepted sense? What capacity has the Air Corps to defend Ireland against airborne attack, particularly an airborne terrorist attack?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_42" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_98">I join Deputy Sherlock in expressing sympathy to the Heery family on the death of one of our young pilots, Captain Heery, in very tragic circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">Regarding air defence, the Defence Forces have one Giraffe mobile air defence radar with a range of up to 40 km and eight Flycatcher mobile air defence fire control radars with a range of 20 km. Twenty-four Beaufort L70 air defence guns were purchased from the Royal Netherlands Air Force following the events of 11 September 2001 and these weapons are controlled directly by the Flycatcher radars. The projected capability of these guns allows for the simultaneous protection of four airports plus a reserve. The Defence Forces also have six Bofors RBS missile launchers for use with the Giraffe radar. The radar systems have the capacity to detect overflights by aircraft and the Air Defence Regiment is fully trained in the use of the guns.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">The weapons system in the new Pilatus aircraft will provide further capability in terms of air defence and would include machine guns and rocket launchers. The Pilatus is primarily a training facility for the Air Corps. It is a vitally important acquisition because training pilots is one of the most essential tasks the Air Corps must perform in terms of the various roles it will subsequently be asked to perform for the Government and the people. It is essential that the pilots have this facility. Three of these aircraft have already landed here. Later this month and before the end of June the next five, bringing the total to eight Pilatus aircraft, will havearrived here. The total cost is approximately €60 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_101">What action would the Minister order, as Minister for Defence, if he were told a hijacked aircraft over the Atlantic was heading in this direction and threatening to crash into a key installation or a city centre? Is it not the case that in such a situation all that could be done would be to appeal to some other country, probably Great Britain, to intercept the plane on our behalf? Does he consider that to be acceptable? I am not suggesting that we spend large sums of money on acquiring fighter aircraft. However, we should have some policy for providing protection against airborne attack.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">Some of the richest countries in the world with defence budgets which would shock Deputies McGinley and Sherlock and myself, are unable to deal with the type of circumstance Deputy Sherlock has outlined. I do not want to speculate on such matters. It is clear we have limited ground-to-air and air defence capacity. It is also recognised that nothing can be done to defend against the type of terrorist activity carried out in Madrid. That scenario was far removed from that envisaged in Deputy Sherlock's proposition. However, it illustrates the variety of challenges that can arise in terms of a terrorist attack.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">We live in a community of nations where terrorist attacks are usually not just a problem for one particular country but for the world community. As I have emphasised on many occasions, the clearest and most decisive way to deal with such problems has always been effective — detection, intelligence and suppression of a cell before it reaches the stage outlined by Deputy Sherlock. In addition, very critical questions arise in the kinds of circumstances he has outlined, because many bogus things are happening in the world. How truthful is the information? Is this a rogue aircraft or is it totally innocent? Will the people on the aircraft be given an opportunity to regain control? How much time is there to intervene? I do not want to speculate on these matters, but they are very serious.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">Deputy Sherlock and others are entitled to ask but, needless to say, in dealing with them and in being absolutely truthful with the public, one must recognise the essential facts. One of those is that the largest and richest countries in the world are grappling with how to confront such situations. We are part of a community of nations that constitutes the EU and with our partners try to the extent we can to confront these issues. I hope the scenario described by Deputy Sherlock does not happen. However, the level of threat to this country as defined by the Garda Síochána, which is responsible for this area, is nothing like that.</p>

        <b>Dr. Cowley</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Defence</b>

          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_45" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_106">Among the roles assigned to the Air Corps under the White Paper on Defence is the provision of air ambulance services. The Air Corps provides a limited air ambulance service subject to the nature of the mission, available aircraft and other operational commitments. To this end, the Air Corps deploys an Allouette helicopter for daylight missions and, subject to availability, a Dauphin helicopter for night-time operations and also for some neo-natal transfers. In certain circumstances, both the Beechcraft and the CASA Maritime patrol aircraft have been used in the air ambulance role. In addition, the new Lear Jet can be configured for air ambulance and patient transfer.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">Each aircraft deployed carries a selection of mission specific medical equipment, the scale of which meets the requirements of each transfer. In this regard, the Air Corps has worked closely with hospital specialists to procure specific equipment and fittings for both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">Air Corps helicopters operate from both airports and, where available and deemed safe, hospital helipads. Most transfers are airport to airport with onward transfer by land ambulance. All air ambulance taskings are passed to the Air Corps by a regional ambulance controller.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">The provision of this service is on an "as is" basis. The level of service offered reflects the multi-purpose role of the Air Corps. The Air Corps has clearly stated the available capability to hospitals and health boards. The question of whether to use the service is a clinical decision to be made by relevant medical staff on a case by case basis having regard to the nature of the available service and the best interests of their patients. In this regard, my Department has recently entered into discussions with the Department of Health and Children to formalise the current service arrangements under a service level agreement. The service provided, limited as it is, is well regarded by those who use it and who understand the nature of the service. For so long as that remains the case, I will continue to offer the service.</p>

            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_110">I am grateful for the Minister's reply. I too sympathise with the family of the young pilot who died so tragically.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">It is not my intention to bash the Air Corps, but the facts speak for themselves. The Beaumont study of 2000 shows the Air Corps service to be a farce. People who are desperately ill awaiting transfer for urgent treatment must wait an average of 12.25 hours for an Air Corps helicopter to arrive. However, the Air Corps has other jobs to do. It spends more time carrying Government Ministers than it spends doing mercy missions, and it is based in Dublin and therefore unavailable. That means that the 400 to 600 potential missions that should be done are not done. A total of 200 missions was carried out in 1997, decreasing to 86 missions in 2001 and people die as a result.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">Would the Minister not agree that the answer is in the recently published study into the all-Ireland helicopter emergency medical service feasibility study, which is two years overdue, which states very clearly that this inter hospital service would work at a cost of €12 million plus €4 million annual running costs? That would include the cost of the helipad at Beaumont Hospital which is urgently needed. It would help our hardworking ambulance men to transfer people, say babies with meningococcal meningitis, and save their lives. What good is it to a baby fighting for its life to have to wait for this very essential service? Does the Minister not agree that the service is more needed than the six new Air Corps helicopters the Minister spoke about five months ago and in respect of which tenders have been issued?</p>
            <p eId="para_113">Plans have been made to mind President Bush, but it is more important to mind our people. Charity begins at home. Why will the Minister not sanction the helicopter emergency medical service, which needs just one helicopter? The report speaks of consultation between the Department of Defence and the Department of Health and Children. Does the Minister not agree that it is imperative that the helicopter emergency medical service is established, especially in light of the findings of the Hanly report? The Garda has a dedicated helicopter because it feels that such a service is needed when crime takes place. What about people? Is the Government's priority military operations, President Bush, crime or the ill people of Ireland?</p>

            <p eId="para_116">It is equally unfair to suggest that a higher priority is given to the transport of Ministers or others than to urgent missions to transfer patients to hospital. There were 96 missions in 2003, involving the Dauphin, Alouette, Casa, Beech, Cessna and S61 aircraft. The missions took a total of 240 hours. I pay tribute to the Air Corps, which has a wide variety of roles and provides services such as search and rescue, ambulance and ministerial transport. The Air Corps responds to its various tasks as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">The Deputy referred to an announcement that was made about helicopters. Following the announcement, I established a civil military procurement group to decide on the type of aircraft that would be most suitable. The needs of the health service were to be considered in that context as one of the roles of the Air Corps. Unfortunately, developments in the search and rescue service in the west meant that the matter had to be reconsidered. I hope in the next week to advertise in the journal for tenders for six new helicopters.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">I do not disagree with the Minister's contention that the Air Corps does a good job. It is not the fault of the Air Corps that it does not provide the dedicated service for which there is such a great need. Will the Minister make the case for the need to replace the Air Corps service with a dedicated service? A man is now paralysed for life and is in a wheelchair because the Air Corps was not available to bring him where he needed to go. He paid a high price.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">Will the Minister not consider the establishment of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service? A report that has been overdue for two years states that we should put in place such a service. The Minister arranged the commissioning of the report North and South. Will the Minister not take all of us, including the Air Corps, out of our misery by deciding to proceed with a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service?</p>

            <p eId="para_124">I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 104 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region. The Air Corps provides the search and rescue service off the north-west coast while a private operator, CHCI, provides the service from Dublin, Shannon and Waterford. I announced late last year that I had decided to withdraw the Air Corps from the search and rescue service. The decision was made following a considered assessment of the ability of the Air Corps to return to and to maintain a full 24-hour service in the north-west. Deputies will recall that the service had been restricted following an unusually high incidence of sick leave among the winch crews. There is no plan to reconsider the decision to withdraw from the search and rescue service.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">The Air Corps will continue to provide its current limited service while the coast guard makes alternative arrangements for the return of a full search and rescue service in the north-west. I have been informed by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, that proposals are under assessment and that a final decision is expected shortly. Air Corps pilots will continue to train in search and rescue techniques. It is envisaged that they will support limited non-maritime search and rescue services.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_54">
            <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_127">I regret that the Minister does not seem to have any plans to return responsibility for search and rescue services to the Air Corps, particularly in the north-west. I am sure the Minister will agree that the Air Corps provided an excellent service when it operated in the north-west and other parts of the country. Its staff acted as we have come to expect of them. Does the Minister agree that the current circumstances in the north-west are unacceptable in that we do not have a 24 hour service? When an emergency arises in the north-west, as has happened on numerous occasions since last January when the service was taken over by a private company, the service is often unavailable.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">I understand that the service that is available in the north-west is limited. The facility to respond to calls does not exist after 7.30 p.m. When a request was made for assistance last Sunday morning, a helicopter in Sligo was unable to respond to a call from Sligo where a young man lost his life. We had to depend on assistance from Baldonnel, but the helicopter was halfway to Sligo when the young man's body was found. Such a case illustrates the difficulties we have because the north-west is so exposed at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">The Minister said in his reply that responsibility has been given to a private company. Such a transfer was envisaged on 2 January last. What is the position of the transfer to the private company? When will the company assume full responsibility? When will it be able to provide a full 24 hour service to that area? The seas off the north-west coast are probably more treacherous than any in Ireland, if not Europe. It is a serious problem, but nothing seems to be happening. We have half a service. The Minister should bear the responsibility because he withdrew the facility from the Air Corps in the first instance. He has a responsibility to restore some sort of service before there is further loss of life.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_55" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_130">I will not evade any of my responsibilities as Minister for Defence. Deputy McGinley is well aware that responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services does not lie with the Minister for Defence, but with the Irish Coast Guard. Such services are provided by CHCI at Waterford, Dublin and Shannon. The Air Corps continues to provide a limited service pending the provision of a full 24 hour service by CHCI. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has indicated to me that his Department's discussions with CHCI about the provision of a full service are in their final stages and that the matter is being treated with extreme urgency. The service being provided by the Air Corps in the interim undertook three missions in January, two in February, four in March and two in April. Some 14 people were rescued during that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">I cannot be expected to take the blame for my decision to discontinue the Air Corps service, given that I was unable to guarantee continuity of the emergency life-saving service. On the basis of the information given to me by the Air Corps, I would not have been in a position to provide the service on a full-time basis — 24 hours a day, seven days a week — until March 2005 at the earliest. When I received indications from CHCI that it would be in a position to provide a full-time service at a much earlier date, I naturally had to face my responsibilities in that regard. I am anxious to help in any way I can.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">The Air Corps is still involved in missions and will have a full winch crew for little less than half the monthly requirements. That is the very best I can do. I am anxious to see the Irish Coast Guard and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources complete the arrangement with the private company which will take over the provision of this service and which has provided an excellent service throughout the rest of the country.</p>

            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_135">The military authorities advise that the current establishment for medical officers in the Permanent Defence Force is 51 and the current strength is 20. In common with other public sector health service providers, the medical corps encounters difficulty in the recruitment and retention of medical personnel. The Department of Defence, in consultation with the director of the medical corps, is seeking ways to recruit additional medical personnel, notwithstanding these difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">Over the past number of years, the medical corps has had difficulty in attracting more than one or two medical officers per year into the service. Part of the difficulty in attracting applicants may be due to the unique nature of military medical officer appointments. Service in the medical corps is not a professional training employment comparable to non-consultant hospital doctor appointments or vocational training schemes in general practice. Where no military medical or dental officer is available, suitable local arrangements are made with civilian medical and dental practitioners to ensure that the appropriate level of professional care is available to members of the Defence Forces.</p>

            <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_137">I raised the issue of the shortage of medical personnel in the Defence Forces in December 2002. RACO, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, described the military medical service as being close to collapse because of the critical shortage of medical officers. At that time there were 33 medical officers serving in the Defence Forces and it is alarming to find the figure has fallen to 20, about 40% of the recommended number. How many of the current 20 medical officers are serving with troops abroad and how much is paid by the Defence Forces each year to civilian doctors who provide care in the absence of the appropriate medical personnel?</p>

            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_138">One can come to the House prepared for as many questions as possible, but I do not know how much is paid by the Defence Forces to civilian doctors. I can find that out for the Deputy. He should bear in mind that many services are provided by civilian medical personnel for the Defence Forces, and those services supplement the medical services supplied by permanent medical staff in the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">There is a genuine problem in attracting medical personnel to the Defence Forces. We have considered a variety of ways of attracting such personnel and will continue to work on the problem. Suggestions have been made by colleagues in the House and I am considering them. We have two serving medical officers in Liberia, one of whom came from the private sector and is on a short-service commission.</p>

            <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_140">When I raised this matter in December 2002 the Minister told me the Department, in consultation with the director of the medical corps, was endeavouring to seek ways to recruit additional medical personnel. It appears nothing has been done since then. Is it the Minister's intention to bring retired medical personnel back into the Defence Forces?</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_61" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_141">That suggestion has been made to me and I am considering it. It is not the usual or traditional practice in the Defence Forces to take such action but we are faced with a quite significant problem and we must consider every option. In 2003 we had one medical officer on a short-term commission who came from the private sector. There was no successful recruitment in 2002. Three medical officers were hired in 2001, one in 2000 and one in 1999. This is not for the want of trying.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">I hope this will not be misinterpreted but we are dealing with what is probably one of the fittest, most health-conscious group of people in the country. It is due to the nature of the tasks that must sometimes be performed that the medical expertise needed must be of a high standard and as widely available as possible, particularly when we are undertaking missions abroad.</p>

            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_149">I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 49, 51, 65, 111 and 112 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">I welcome this opportunity to update the House on discussions on European security and defence policy. On 5 and 6 April, I chaired an informal meeting in Brussels of Defence Ministers of EU member states and accession states. A number of such informal meetings have been held in recent years. The meetings have been a useful forum for informal discussions in the context of the ongoing development of European security and defence policy. The April meeting provided us with an opportunity to review and discuss the major issues in the ESDP mandate of the Irish Presidency. As the meeting was informal, it was not a decision-making forum and no formal conclusions were drawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">On 17 May I will chair a meeting of Defence Ministers in the framework of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, at which formal decisions regarding the issues discussed at the informal meeting will be taken. The first item on the agenda was capabilities development. As the House will be aware, the Irish Presidency has been mandated to take forward work on the further development of European military capabilities to carry out Petersberg Tasks operations. In particular, we were tasked to develop a European capabilities action plan, roadmap and capability improvement chart. The purpose of the roadmap and chart is to facilitate Defence Ministers in guiding the process of capability development to best effect. Ministers reviewed progress to date and supported our approach to developing the roadmap and capability improvement chart. We then turned our attention to the second agenda item, the headline goal 2010. We had a useful exchange of views on the draft headline goal 2010 document as prepared by the EU Council secretariat. The views expressed at the meeting have been useful in guiding ongoing work.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">The first day's session concluded with an exchange of views on the EU military rapid response paper as presented by Secretary General and High Representative, Javier Solana. The paper recommends that work on rapid response should be focused on four areas: rapid reaction capability, including qualitative and quantitative criteria; decision-making and planning; relations with the UN; and relations with NATO. The paper refers to the need for rapid response capabilities which should be clearly identifiable in the form of coherent rapid reaction battle groups. There was general support for the battle group concept and Ministers considered the way ahead with a view to achieving concrete results as soon as possible in the field of capabilities available and deployable at very high readiness, including battle groups, in support of the UN. Work on the battle groups concept is ongoing and the aim is to agree a concept by the end of June 2004. An initial battle group capability is envisaged in 2005 and a more extensive capability in 2007. This concluded the first day's meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">When the meeting resumed on 6 April, the first matter for our consideration was the proposed European defence agency. The overall aim of the agency is to support the development of the Union's crisis management capabilities. Our debate was informed by an update by the head of the agency establishment team. Ministers voiced continued support for the work of the team with a view to adoption, by June 2004, of the necessary Council decision for the creation of the agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">As Deputies may recall, the European Council held in Brussels in December 2003 confirmed the EU's readiness for an ESDP follow-on mission to the UN mandated NATO-led stabilisation force in Bosnia Herzegovina. This was discussed as the final agenda item with particular reference to lessons learned from previous operations. The meeting ended with a working lunch at which discussion on the follow-on mission to SFOR continued in the context of EU-NATO co-operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">Discussion on terrorism, the other theme for the working lunch, focused on the ESDP aspects of the recently approved European Council declaration. Ministers generally agreed that this issue is primarily for Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">I again remind the House that as the meeting was informal and not a decision-making forum, no formal conclusions were drawn. I will be chairing a meeting of Defence Ministers on 17 May in the framework of the GAERC which will be a formal meeting at which decisions in relation to ESDP will be taken. I look forward to briefing the House on the outcome of that meeting in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_157">What are the perceived military shortfalls in this country as far as the European Union capability improvement chart is concerned? How much will it cost to make up the shortfall? In the light of these commitments, is it expected that Ireland will have to increase its defence budget as a percentage of gross domestic product?</p>
            <p eId="para_158">Will the Minister expand on the discussion he has had on Ireland's relationship with NATO? Will the expanding relationship with NATO have any effect on our status as a neutral State?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_64" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_159">I do not anticipate any demands on the Exchequer in regard to the capability improvement chart and the shortfalls, as they relate to countries that have a significant investment in the defence area, whereas Irish investment up to now has been primarily related to basic needs that had to be met independent of European security and defence issues. All the acquisitions in which we have been involved are primarily directed at upgrading facilities and equipment to meet our UN requirements. I do not envisage any change in the demands made on Government by me as Minister for Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">It was always envisaged, notwithstanding the recognition of the independence of NATO and the EU, that in certain areas the relationship between the EU and NATO would be developed. Deputy Gormley will be familiar with the Irish contingents involvement in the UN mandated missions, SFOR and KFOR, run by NATO. These primarily reside around the heavier type of transport equipment and facilities for Petersberg Tasks operations or UN missions where there would not be the necessity for the duplication of assets. It would make no sense that member states involved in Petersberg Tasks operations in EU-UN mandated mission would purchase equipment that was already available, particularly equipment used in the heavy transport area.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">There are no implication for our traditional military neutrality in anything in which we are engaged. We are primarily trying to improve the capacity in the European Union to undertake Petersberg Tasks and not have a repeat of the situation where countries stood idly by during terrible atrocities in Europe and seemed incapable of intervening. The debate on the rapid reaction force and other areas is primarily to ensure that UN mandated missions can be undertaken more quickly and effectively with greater inter-operability and the quality of what we do, both militarily and civil, can be enhanced by these arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_163">Was the deteriorating situation in Iraq discussed and, if so, what conclusions were drawn and were views expressed on the role of UN troops in Iraq?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_66" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_164">Discussion took place on UN-EU relations, but not in the context of Iraq. As I mentioned in the course of my reply, these informal meetings take place between Defence Ministers over a number of years under different administrations to enhance the European security and defence policy and to examine the historically proven gaps in capabilities and to what extent, without compromising fundamental principles, we and others can assist each other in the provision of Petersberg Tasks operations, undertaking missions more effectively and quickly and conflict prevention.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">We have never exercised our minds in the past to the degree we might have done on the actions that need to be taken on conflict prevention. We seem to undertake the missions when the holocaust, the genocide, the murder and mayhem has taken place. I share the concerns of Members at the reasons we are not in a position to try to offset or intervene in developing crises at an earlier stage. That calls for working together, inter-operability, partnership, training exercises and so on.</p>

            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_166">In the context of European defence and security, to what extent does the Minister expect responsibility to fall on the Department of Defence and the institutions of the State in combating terrorism? What role does he expect the Defence Forces to play and to what extent have his EU colleagues impressed on the Minister the role to be played by the Irish authorities? Are the available facilities adequate to meet all eventualities in such circumstances?</p>

            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_167">As Deputy Durkan knows, I chair the task force on emergency planning. At all those meetings, one of the first reports is from the Garda authorities and the Defences Forces on the threat assessment. Most of the work involves Departments and agencies gearing up their facilities whether in terms of protocols, investment in vaccines by the Department of Health and Children, improvement of safety procedures on aircraft and in airports, the responsibilities of the local authorities, the question of how to deal with a nuclear accident and the acquisition by my Department of detection and screening kits and of nuclear, biological and chemical suits — I think we have purchased approximately 7,000 of those. In the first instance, it is a continual assessment by the Garda and the Defence Forces and then upgrading, getting greater co-ordination and ensuring that all the elements that go into emergency planning are developed and enhanced and are capable of dealing with as much as we can humanly think about.</p>

            <p eId="para_168">As we all know, a priority of the EU seems to be the development of a common defence policy whereby member states would come to each other's assistance. At these ministerial meetings which the Minister chairs during the Presidency, is the formulation of a common defence policy ever discussed? Is the Minister precluded from participating in such discussions due to our so-called neutrality? At what stage is the common defence policy? Does the Minister believe we should participate?</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_70" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_169">We do not have discussions on a common defence policy. We have made it absolutely clear on numerous occasions that any discussions, decisions or recommendations on going down that road, which is not on the map at present, would have to be put to the people. We have no intention or proposals in that regard.</p>

As an EU member state, we have a duty to raise it. In the context of NATO, will the Minister raise it when he meets his American counterpart?</p>

They are abominable and I will have no hesitation in raising my voice at the appropriate time in this regard. In terms of human rights and the dignity of people, anything done which sets out to humiliate and degrade persons to that degree is totally objectionable and reprehensible.</p>

This item has arisen in recent days but, as I have indicated, I will be anxious to use my voice in whatever way I can to enforce what is recognised all over the world as the way prisoners should be dealt with. As I said, what happened in Iraq is totally reprehensible and objectionable.</p>

            <p eId="para_175">I already indicated to Deputy Gormley that these are in the heavy end of military equipment. As the Deputy knows, I have an ongoing acquisition policy funded primarily by the sale of assets to improve the ability and capacity of our Defence Forces in terms of their safety and our ability to undertake missions previously impossible for us. Three or four years ago, there would have been no way I could have recommended to the House, the Government or to the people to send a mission to Liberia. Were it not for the acquisition of the DROPS, the armoured personnel carriers, the medical equipment and the communications systems involving up to €100 million investment, we could not have undertaken that type of mission. I have said many times that I want to have an independent approach to the missions we undertake under United Nations' mandates. To do so, we need our own equipment and facilities. As I said, we could not have undertaken the Liberian mission two or three years ago but for these acquisitions.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_179">We have reached a sad state of affairs when we cannot accept the truthfulness of answers given by the Taoiseach in the House. It is in that context that I ask my question. I will first remind the House of the Taoiseach's words here on 10 February 1999.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_180">I have continually and unambiguously made clear since Good Friday. . . . .1998 that any reference by the Sinn Féin negotiators regarding the release of the late Jerry McCabe's murderers could not be considered . . . . . At no time was anyone given any comfort about these people and neither will they be.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Since he uttered these words, the Taoiseach has answered questions on the peace process virtually on a monthly basis and he has never once mentioned this issue as being one of the sticking points in the negotiations. When he specifically reported on those negotiations of last October, it was not mentioned even though Sinn Féin is today claiming that these releases were part of the agreed sequence of events and statements. In doing this secret, dirty deal with the IRA, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have callously broken their word to the people and have betrayed the McCabe family.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">People should remember that Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was serving democracy and his country when he was brutally murdered by violent thugs who only avoided 40 year sentences for capital murder by intimidating key trial witnesses. If we cannot believe what the Taoiseach has been telling us in this House for the past five years, why should we believe him now? I ask the Taoiseach to put away the script prepared by the spin doctors and to give an honest answer to the following question. When did his Government abandon its solemn promise of putting this concession on the table? Will he confirm Gerry Adams's claim today that the release of these killers was part of the deal agreed last October which was halted at the last minute by David Trimble? Was this part of the October deal — yes or no?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_79">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_183">The full implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement has not been achieved to date. What became apparent to the two Governments as time went on was that the agreement was unlikely to ever reach full implementation unless certain issues were settled, some going beyond the terms of the agreement. It was from this that the concept of "acts of completion" emerged. What was envisaged in "acts of completion" was nothing short of a definitive settlement of the Northern question involving as one of its central elements the complete end to all forms of paramilitary activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">What emerged by April 2003 was a complex set of understandings involving a range of elements, which would emerge as a sequence of agreed statements and supporting actions, some by Governments, some by Sinn Féin, some by the IRA and some by Unionists. This came very close to realisation in March 2003 but ultimately failed, as did a subsequent attempted settlement last October, essentially involving the same range of elements.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">The Governments are now engaged in fresh efforts to bring a definitive end to the Northern conflict, yet we are again seeking to find a way in which an outcome involving essentially the same elements could be achieved. It is no secret that the range of elements to which I refer include matters such as the stability of the inclusive institutions, the ending of paramilitarism in all its forms, the decommissioning of all illegally held arms, the issue of demilitarisation, policing and human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">While it is unhelpful to the process of negotiation — indeed, any negotiation — to single out any single element and try to deal with it outside the only context in which it has relevance, one element has been brought into the public domain, the question of releasing the IRA prisoners in Castlerea. The issue of the possible releases of those prisoners has been consistently raised by Sinn Féin, in the same way as the question has arisen about how to handle those who may be responsible for paramilitary crimes committed before the Good Friday Agreement, and those who remained on the run, the so-called OTRs.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Questions were raised in the House about this issue as far back as March last year when I said that the Government was considering how to deal with these issues. The case of OTRs and that of the Castlerea prisoners are not unrelated — neither is covered by the Good Friday Agreement. Our goal last spring and in October, as I have said, was to clear the way on all outstanding issues, including the republican movement finally and definitively making an historic move away from violence. We did not achieve the outcome we were working for at that time. Because of this, the question of the release of these prisoners — or, indeed, resolving the OTR and other issues like demilitarisation, all of which were elements of the sequence — could not be pursued. These issues, therefore, remain on the agenda. Sinn Féin has made it clear that it is unable to convince the IRA leadership to take the necessary steps without the situation of the Castlerea prisoners being resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">Let me be clear that, for its part, the Government can consider the early release of these prisoners only in the context where the achievement of all other acts of completion, as set out, was assured. This means assurance of the complete ending of paramilitarism by the IRA, and decommissioning. This is something that we have been trying to achieve through intense engagement over the past two years and more. It is a goal for which successive Irish Governments have been striving since the foundation of the State, and it remains our goal.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_189">The Taoiseach's reply is a disgrace. He knows that the early release of the convicted killers of Jerry McCabe was outside the conditions of the Good Friday Agreement. Does the Taoiseach seriously expect us to believe that this concession is the main blocking point to the final implementation of the Good Friday Agreement? If that is the case, why has he never reported that single issue to this House? It is clear that this secret deal was done with the IRA, and the Taoiseach's recent promise to consult the McCabe family is completely and utterly hypocritical. Surely he has read the letter from the Minister for zero tolerance, Deputy O'Donoghue to Mrs. Ann McCabe and his subsequent statement to the Dáil in which he said "I wonder how many different ways we have to say no for these people to get the message that those involved will not have the benefit of the early release terms of the British-Irish Agreement."</p>

The Provisional IRA now believes that it will get whatever it demands in return for the fulfilment of its commitments. Fine Gael rejects this concession being put on the table by the Government. It offends ordinary decent people throughout the land. Where is the Taoiseach's moral strength now? Where is his moral defence of standing for those who stand up for democracy? Is it not a fact that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have been blackmailed by the IRA into putting this concession on the table? He expects us to believe that it is the last single remaining obstacle to a peaceful Ireland but this U-turn is a step too far. Will he tell Sinn Féin that the Irish people will not accept it?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_193">It is our view that the release of the prisoners in Castlerea does not come under the Good Friday Agreement. That was reflected in the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act 1998. It is not the only issue on the agenda. I would not like anybody in this House or outside it to believe, as a result of this debate, that it is a single issue. There is an enormous range of issues, including demilitarisation, prisoners, OTRs and fundamental human rights. If we had been successful in obtaining the framework we set out in March last year, there would have been a whole sequence of events concerning a whole range of issues, some of which have been mentioned. If we ever want an end to the IRA, which is what I want, we will have to be brave and take some pain to get some gain. If we want to take a purist view that we will end paramilitarism in all its forms, that will not be done by taking one point and dealing with it in isolation. I will be as tough as is necessary against Sinn Féin and the IRA but if we can get a complete set of agreements we will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">We had also decided how we would discuss this with the Garda bodies, the McCabe family and Ben O'Sullivan's family. There was no question of the Government making or announcing a deal without consultation with those families.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">I wanted to raise with the Taoiseach his silence on, and the absence of reference on the websites of his Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs or the EU Presidency to the shocking violations of international humanitarian law in Iraq that we see in newspapers and on television. However, having just heard the Taoiseach's comments it is important to go back to the murder of Detective Jerry McCabe. Do I understand the Taoiseach to have told Deputy Kenny that this was not the only issue? He said there is an enormous range of outstanding issues to be dealt with. Was the release of those who murdered Jerry McCabe being used as a concession for a single act of decommissioning last October? It was not at all the act of completion that we were led to believe, even in the secondary explanation by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">The choreography went wrong in October because we did not know the extent or scale of the act of decommissioning that took place. Is the Taoiseach now saying, however, that the release of those who murdered Jerry McCabe was intruded in return for that single act of decommissioning? I cannot understand how he can reconcile that with the letter to Mrs. McCabe from the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, which appears in today's <i>Irish Examiner</i>, and states: “I hope that what I said at the meeting provided you with assurance that there is no question of granting early release to those concerned, either under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement or, for that matter, on any other basis either.”</p>

          <p eId="para_201">I am not saying that a sovereign Government ought not reserve to itself the right to do what it thinks is best in circumstances where the complete departure from violence as a weapon of political advancement is agreed, verified and signed up to. To intrude this as a pawn in negotiations to extract further concessions in the snail's pace progress towards what may or may not be a final settlement in the future is utterly unacceptable, apart from being entirely at variance with what the Taoiseach said in this House and what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said to Mrs. McCabe.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">Perhaps Deputy Rabbitte missed what I said yesterday at the press conference when I comprehensively dealt with the issue of the inhumane treatment of the prisoners in Iraq. I dealt with that yesterday and I do not want to let that point go unanswered.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I did not want to give an impression to Deputy Rabbitte, which I do not think I did, that this was a part of the settlement. There are not many matters left for the Irish Government to deal with, although there are issues regarding "on the runs", OTRs, human rights and equality which we must address in the overall context of agreement. We must be 100% clear, however, that the consideration by Government of releasing the Castlerea five would only be in terms of the end of paramilitarism and a final agreement. It was not an interim position and I assure the House of that. It would only take place in the event of full completion of the condition set out in paragraph 13 of the joint declaration, namely, the end of paramilitarism — "the ending of conflict" was the phrase used — and, as the Deputy knows, those are the words the IRA has difficulty broaching. We did not, however, achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">There are many issues the British Government must address. It stated that within the context of acts of completion, it would bring before Parliament the legislation necessary to resolve outstanding cases on a basis involving judicial process and showing sensitivity to the position of victims. The Irish Government would address similar cases in this jurisdiction. That is set out in the joint declaration. We would only look at any of these issues, however, if there was completion and I hope we will arrive at that position as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">We are not at that position. We are further from it than we were when we discussed these issues in April 2003. October was only a mirror of that time because it was in April 2003 that the detailed discussions took place. However, we did not get there. We nearly made it in April 2003 and, in the view of the Irish Government, we did not come as close in October 2003 as a result of a range of issues. If I gave every detail of the negotiations in recent years, such as what was said and thought, we would be unable to negotiate any arrangement. This is not an industrial relations issue. We are trying to end for once and for all the paramilitary violence that has almost ruined this country economically for a quarter of a century. We want an end to the Provisional IRA and the remnants of paramilitarism. It is only in that context that I, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or any of us collectively would go to the McCabe family and say we think this could take place as part of the greater picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">We would not go if we thought we were only getting a little process along the way. The reason we never did it was because we did not get to where we wanted. We tried and we will continue to try, but that is our position. I do not think we did other than the proper discharge of our duties in trying to bring finality to paramilitary violence in this country.</p>

The murder of a serving member of the Garda Síochána, however, is a step too far for most Members of this House, be that difficult or not to reconcile with some of the terrible events that have happened in Northern Ireland. Therefore, when the Taoiseach led the people to believe that the killers of Jerry McCabe were outside the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, and when his Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform unequivocally assured his widow in that regard, it is a shock to discover that, in fact, it was a pawn on the chess board in the context of a single act of decommissioning last October.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">On the second issue, the Government has not used this as any part of the negotiation process. We firmly stated that we were prepared to consider this issue only as part of the end position if we reached it. We did not reach it, as we have seen recently from the report of the International Monitoring Commission. We were trying to achieve a position where all the outstanding aspects listed by the British Government, David Trimble, the UUP and other parties were dealt with in a comprehensive agreement and that there would be a sequence and a process dealing with that. We did not achieve that so the issues surrounding any aspect of it — OTRs, demilitarisation, further moves on equality, human rights or the horrendous killing in Adare on 7 June 1996 of Jerry McCabe and the injuring of Ben O'Sullivan — did not arise because we did not arrive at that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">In terms of an overall total agreement and the end of paramilitarism, we would have considered it. We would have tried to achieve finality in the matter, but it did not happen so that part and any other parts of the agreement, many of which are in the public domain and many of which are not, are still being discussed with all parties. This was of the highest sensitivity, however, and we would not do anything without direct contact between the Government, the widow of Jerry McCabe and the family of Ben O'Sullivan.</p>

          <p eId="para_223">We do not know if AIB Bank will rename its currency department the "foreign short change desk" but we know that the bank's swindling of its foreign exchange customers of up to €25 million is only the latest in a long saga of scams by many banks to maximise their already bloated profits through dubious means. Why do powerful financial institutions feel, after all the previous scandals, that they can still swindle their customers, let alone levy bank charges on us with impunity?</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Is it not the case that under the Taoiseach's seven-year stewardship, he has operated a different law for the economically powerful in society in contrast with how small people are treated? His Government has operated a nauseating double standard by which the economically powerful may occasionally get mild slaps on the wrist, mainly verbal, but are not really held accountable. In the absence of the Taoiseach last week, I asked the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, about some of the double standards. The Taoiseach may have heard the Minister found himself severely challenged in the articulation department in response to Opposition questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">A young person may take possession of a Garda hat and find himself or herself charged with stealing and lodged in jail for many days with the threat of being kept there longer. Major banks stole up to €1 billion from taxation funds, which means it came from health services, hospitals and schools. How many of the 7,000 gardaí mobilised on May Day did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, ask to knock on the door of the boardroom of a major bank and ask the simple question of who organised the rackets and tax frauds and instructed staff around the country, factoring it into the profits of the bank "going forward", as they like to say in business circles? Is it not the reality that, after seven years of Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats rule, the Ansbacher men and the organisers of the big bank tax frauds have as much chance of being dragged before a court as the poor, stone age men the National Roads Authority is now turning up every second week?</p>

          <p eId="para_226">The Deputy left out the fact this Government moved from the position under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, whereby credit institutions were required to notify the Director of Consumer Affairs on any charges imposed by them, but the director was not able to do much about it. That responsibility was transferred to the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority which this Government established exactly one year ago, and severe financial penalties are provided for in the Act. As we know, AIB indicated that in the mid-1990s it was charging 1% on non-cash transactions exceeding IR£500,000. It notified the Director of Consumer Affairs that it was charging 0.5%. The error related to a single charge among a large number notified to the Director of Consumer Affairs. It appears AIB noticed its discrepancy two years ago but no action was taken. In April 2004, IFSRA received an anonymous call raising the issue. On 30 April, IFSRA raised the matter with compliance officials in AIB and the matter was raised in the media the following week. Statements have been made. IFSRA has launched an investigation into this matter as it is the relevant authority. It has very strong powers and is actively pursuing the matter with AIB at a senior level. It can impose severe financial penalties.</p>

However, as the Taoiseach said in answer to earlier questions, every decent-minded person who has observed what has been happening, is horrified and disgusted. The Irish Government has obviously used its position of influence during the Presidency to promote, in so far as it can, an alternative approach. I do not want to commit myself as to whether we can have an independent group. I know that will be dealt with later this evening. Deputy Michael D. Higgins raised that matter. We have not given consideration to it, but I believe we should have an open mind on whether something like that could be brought to bear to bring an end to this situation.

Is that not the Government's responsibility on promised legislation? Second, I would like to ask about the amount of money being talked about for coastal protection. <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> gave a figure of €150 million for Dublin City Council alone.

        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_324">There is considerable agreement on the need for a health service reform programme. Unfortunately, there is little agreement between parties and, even in some instances within parties, on how best that might be achieved. The national health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, set out the vision and goals for the health service up to 2010. This Bill is the first of two planned for this year, as outlined by the Minister for Health and Children, and is intended to reform structures which have served us reasonably well for more than 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">I recall the debates that took place in council chambers, where I was a member, and elsewhere, during which councillors castigated regional health boards more than they did successive Ministers for Health, even when they came from a different party. Most councillors who were members prior to 1974 claimed that the change from a county to a regional structure was disastrous for health care generally, but in particular for outlying areas and hospitals in outlying counties. It is somewhat amusing that so many now lament the proposal to abolish the health boards given that many councillors were calling for their abolition 25 years ago and often again in the interim.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Among the charges laid against health boards, which are now lauded as wonderful structures, was that they were remote, committed only to the regional centre, over-bureaucratic, and employed more management, administrative and clerical personnel than health care personnel such as doctors and nurses. I was never a member of a health board but councillors of all parties were solid and constructive members. Some of the very best of those protest least about the proposal in this Bill. I am not convinced that all the representatives of the professional bodies made as positive a contribution to the health boards as most councillors did. There were some exceptions. Some of the professionals were very constructive but there were others who, despite their expertise and commitment to the health service, were disappointing.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">One difficulty besetting the health boards and which, unless we are careful, may beset future structures was the perceived tug o' war between the executive of the health board and the Department of Health and Children. Sometimes the Department of Finance would oversee that, which would be considered a negative influence too. It was clear to anyone who observed the health service and how it did or did not develop, particularly outside Dublin, that the Department of Health and Children operated to some kind of invisible blueprint.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Most of us rural dwellers believed that blueprint was the Fitzgerald report, which is 70 years old. There were guidelines that could not be found anywhere but which militated strongly against the development of hospitals other than regional ones. In the mid-west, they probably militated against development of the regional hospital as well. Had the report been implemented in County Clare and Ennis General Hospital the consequences would have been disastrous. Even the worst effects of the Hanly report would be a major improvement on the health clinic model proposed by the Fitzgerald report and adopted by a Government in the 1980s. While economic considerations at various times have retarded the development of our health services, the Department blueprint has also had a negative impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">It is important that the Government had the foresight to provide for demographic and geographic considerations as an amendment to its adoption of the Hanly model. The Minster's announcement in County Clare that the 24 hour accident and emergency service will be maintained and be doctor-led is welcome. This does not undermine the general principle of the Hanly report, but merely varies the model for deployment of additional medical personnel, in this instance mainly consultants and senior doctors. It facilitates the much improved blueprint for health care which, together with this legislation, attempts to achieve a much better quality of health service. Whatever other considerations may come into play, and there are many issues which one must take into account, it is incumbent on all of us to do everything we can to ensure that the outcome is the best level of health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">However much I fault elements of what is proposed in the Hanly report, I concede that it is by far the most coherent and constructive response to the litany of difficulties that have beset the health service in recent years. It is the only reasonable way forward in terms of addressing the difficulties arising from the working time directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The report contains a major defect in regard to accident and emergency services, particularly in the mid-west region. We must be clear about what we need in terms of accident and emergency services. A large percentage of this work revolves around care for relatively minor injuries, mostly referred by GPs. Another important element, to which those opposed to the Hanly report have drawn attention, is emergency provision for accident victims, cardiac patients and others. It is clear that this area can be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">Almost every Member of the House will have been in an accident and emergency unit, either as a patient or accompanying a family member. I have been in accident and emergency units on many occasions, usually taking in young people injured in matches who are generally in need of an x-ray or stitches. The quality of care, response time and treatment of people in smaller hospitals, especially in Ennis, has been far superior to what is available in other places. I will not embarrass those regional hospitals by naming them. We need to take account of this and value it.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The Hanly team would probably say that most of the cases I described are ones which present between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. It must be acknowledged that the Hanly report provides for them. We also need to acknowledge that accident victims and cardiac patients will present outside of those hours. Even if the numbers are small, these are patients with medical needs who have family and friends and who would otherwise add to the congestion at regional centres. We must also acknowledge that some of these people would be at considerable risk if they had to make the longer journey implicit in what is proposed in the Hanly report. I welcome the amended model which provides for 24 hour accident and emergency cover. I especially welcome the fact that the people providing such cover will be considerably more qualified than has been the case heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">We must also face the fact that implicit in the Hanly report, and virtually all reports on the health service, is the belief that major improvements need to be made to the quality of patient care. Many of those opposed to the Hanly report have used extreme language. They have said that if the report's recommendations are implemented, people will die. We need to look at the flip side of the coin and examine whether this is already happening because of existing deficiencies.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_200">
          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_336">Some of the improvements proposed in the Hanly report might address the problems. At the very least, Mr. Hanly and his team must be credited with addressing the issue and coming up with a blueprint. It is also important to remember that those involved in preparing the report were not all based in Dublin. Expertise was drawn from all medical disciplines and from around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">There have been strong campaigns, especially in counties Clare and Tipperary, to address the perceived deficiencies in the Hanly report. Their aim is to achieve improvements in what was set out in that report. The difficulty relating to junior hospital doctors and the working time directive is adequately addressed in the report. Other proposals such as those in regard to the ambulance service, primary care and the provision of additional consultants would bring enormous improvement in the quality of health care. Twenthy-four hour accident and emergency cover is worthwhile in Ennis and Nenagh. I am delighted that it has been possible to achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">I acknowledge the support of party colleagues in County Clare and County Tipperary in bringing about a successful conclusion in that regard. I am happy to work with them and other members of the action committees, some of which are called hospital development committees, to achieve the amendments which will give us the kind of health service to which we are entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">We need to ensure that the campaign is cohesive and constructive. Some of what has happened recently in the campaign against the recommendations of the Hanly report, have had a negative effect. Most people involved in the campaign, and I know best those involved in the campaign in County Clare, including some public representatives of Opposition parties, are genuine in their concern and extremely constructive in their approach. They usually resist the temptation to take cheap political shots. However, others who are on a party political crusade are damaging the campaign to make improvements on the Hanly proposals. These people have no regard for patient welfare or the professionals delivering the service in our hospitals. This is having a damaging effect on morale in some smaller hospitals. It also damages public trust in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">In pursuing the campaign to improve the health service, we need to be clear as to whether we accept the Hanly report as a suitable blueprint for reform. I believe it is and I publicly supported the amendments which will improve the quality of service provision as outlined in the report. Many people are trying to dismiss the report in its entirety and, in doing so, they are damaging and diminishing the opportunity to bring additional services to the counties and regions. Ultimately this will contribute to a delay in providing good quality patient care, which is not in anybody's interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">It is a great weakness in the national campaign that we do not have clarity on whether there are positive aspects to the Hanly report. The majority of the recommendations in the report are positive. It sets about addressing the difficulties that exist and the Minister has accepted the merit of the amendments for which people fought.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Regarding the health service reform programme, the Bill sets out a major rationalisation of the existing health service agencies. The most significant element is the abolition of the current health boards and authorities. The Health Service Executive will be the first body ever charged with managing the health service as a single national entity. Anyone who has had reason to examine the work of the health service would agree that something of this nature is required at national level. Many people would also admit that this kind of structure is required at individual hospital level. There seems to be a weakness in management or in the structures in place in a great number of hospitals. From what one would observe as a patient or visitor to an accident and emergency department, one would have to conclude that there are better ways of managing systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The establishment of a health information and quality authority to ensure safety and quality of care is promoted throughout the system is welcome. I would have thought that was a given, but there seems to be a need to proceed in this manner. The change of role of the Department of Health and Children in this area is fundamental and important. There have been weaknesses in policy development and oversights over the years. One of the reasons for that undoubtedly is that the health service has grown laterally to an extent that could not have been foreseen. A range of specialties at hospital level have arisen and a range of care models have been set up. A great many of them are operated semi-professionally or by the voluntary sector. They do important work, by and large, in a cost-effective manner, but ultimately as part of an agglomeration that does not deliver to the patient and to the user in the best possible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">In the health service reform programme there is provision for the modernisation of the supporting processes of the system in terms of service, management, planning, reporting and so on and an aspiration towards international best practice, which I very much welcome. There is also provision for the strengthening of governance and accountability across the system. I believe that will also bear positive results as time goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">There is the work of the national steering committee, which I hope will be fruitful and progressive, but I also hope it will be open to scrutiny by the Oireachtas to suggested improvements and that, as it moves forward, it will have a positive impact on the quality of our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Having regard to this area and specifically what is proposed in the Bill, the changes proposed in structures are quite radical and one would be concerned to ensure that the interim arrangements would not become semi-permanent or last too long. Any elected representative would have some concern about the assignment of the reserve functions of the authorities and the boards to the chief executive officers in the manner proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">In moving forward from the current position to what is planned for the future, there is probably no other way to do this. There must be an interim arrangement and I am not in a position to propose an alternate model other than transferring such authority to the CEOs or to the Minister, but that interim arrangement should not be allowed to last very long. I would not like radical changes to be made during the period of this interim arrangement. Some people have a suspicion that in the absence of the boards to perform the reserve functions, there might be some sleight of hand. It is important to ensure that does not happen because there must be democratic accountability. While one acknowledges that some interim arrangement is required, it is important to ensure it is not abused in the short to medium term.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_348">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. The problem in our health system is the most serious one with which the Government and country must deal. We all know of cases where the system has let people down badly. I warn the people of Ennis and Nenagh that it is only two years since the people of Cavan-Monaghan were given strong promises regarding Monaghan General Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">This Bill aims to abolish the health boards as we know them and to give power to the CEOs to deliver the service. As one who has experienced the activities of the administrators of the health board in the Cavan-Monaghan region in recent years, this proposed change frightens me. Admittedly, the administrators did not take account of the views of the elected representatives in the area because the board, as structured, comprised many other members plus Government hacks. Many measures were bulldozed through regardless. The needs of the people of the area concerned were not a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">This Bill seeks to abolish the structures put in place under 1970 Act, the 1996 Act and the 1999 Act. It will amend the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001, which govern the nomination of members from the city and county councils. The main points of the Bill are that it provides for the abolition of the membership of the health boards, etc. and leaves the way open for the CEOs to take control. To use the Minister's words, what is proposed is the termination of office of all members of the health board on the date on which the order is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">We are taking a serious step in this. A previous speaker said that prior to the health boards being set up, the health service was administered by the county councils. The record of Monaghan General Hospital reveals that when it was run by the local county council and by its chief — a matron — the services available were much better than those available today.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Section 10 states that the CEO must provide the Minister with any information on the performance of his or her functions as the Minister may from time to time require. Section 13 assigns to the Minister the board functions in the appointment and removal of the CEO. The Minister should take this provision seriously because he has avoided making any decision such as that, even having regard to the powers he has had under the existing legislation in the recent past. As a result, the people of Monaghan have seriously suffered. Somebody said that the Hanly might not be perfect and might need tweaking here and there. Those who believe the Hanly report can serve the good of the country need to note what has happened in Monaghan General Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">We are advised that these proposed changes must be made because of the provisions of the working time directive and that the boards will be replaced by a group which will discuss issues with the Minister, the CEOs, etc. That will be a talking shop with no power. I record that in the case of the North Eastern Health Board, even members who were elected to it did not adhere to the agreement made by the people who put them there. I am mindful of the nurses' representative who voted at all times against the interests of Monaghan General Hospital, but when she resigned she was encouraged to go back there not by the nurses but by the administration. That is the type of concern people have about who will run our health service in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I want to return to the point I made about Monaghan General Hospital and the comment I made about the people of Ennis and Nenagh.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Some of the comments I intend to make about Monaghan General Hospital may not be pleasant but they reflect reality. Two years and three months ago the Minister visited the hospital. As reported in <i>The Northern Standard</i> at the time, he stated: “I have been left in no doubt about the depth of feeling in Monaghan about the hospital. My visit has been very positive and productive from that point of view.” He further stated there was no question of Monaghan hospital closing and that this was simply not on anybody’s agenda. He then said: “I understand and realise there are significant credibility issues here. People do not believe what they are being told from official sources. I accept that.” He proceeded to list everything that would be done and stated that in the previous three years alone, €4.5 million had been invested and that 15% more people were using the medical and surgical services than was the case in 1997. All Ministers like to refer to the latter year. The Minister further stated at the time that, in terms of the future, the health board had adopted a plan in 2001 and outlined all the promises it had made.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">These were the commitments made by the Minister to the people of Monaghan in the run-up to a general election. He was adamant that the hospital was needed because the country required additional capacity in its acute hospital services. Referring to the bed shortage nationally, he stated there would be no percentage for any Minister in closing hospitals because all spare capacity was needed. On concerns about the planned surgical services review, the Minister said the health board had indicated that surgical services in Monaghan could not be closed down and that the additional workload could not be met by other hospitals. He added that extra junior doctors would be appointed in order to ensure the accrediting body would not recommend the surgical service be closed. He also said that the latter issue would be "looked at in the coming weeks".</p>
          <p eId="para_357">That is what happened in Monaghan. When one realises what happened in Ennis and Nenagh a few weeks ago, one is left to wonder about the future. What we want, from the Department's point of view, is for surgical services in Monaghan to continue. In the run-up to the most recent general election, the Minister's party gave absolute guarantees that future developments would include a midwife-led maternity unit. It further promised that all medical emergencies would be treated in Monaghan, that surgical emergencies would be treated in Monaghan as determined by the consultant on call and that 80% of accident and emergency would be treated at Monaghan General Hospital. It also promised that substantial funding would be made available for building and refurbishment, that ten extra beds out of the 38 for the North Eastern Health Boards would go to the hospital, that there would be one new consultant geriatrician, one new consultant dermatologist and one new consultant with five junior hospital doctors, and that Monaghan hospital would be staying open. What happened? On 2 July, Monaghan hospital was taken off call.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">The staff at Monaghan General Hospital are doing a great job for those who know how to get in through the backdoor, namely, those who arrive by car. People cannot avail of the ambulance service unless doctors, in individual cases, insist that an ambulance is required. In one recent instance, a doctor simply ordered the ambulance staff to take a patient the short distance to the hospital. The man in question literally died on his way through the doors of the hospital but the staff were able to resuscitate him. That man would not have lived had he been obliged to travel to hospital in Drogheda or some other location. We are talking about matters of life and death.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">In his contribution, the Minister outlined the reasons he wants to do away with the health boards. I am not completely against replacing the health boards, as currently structured. There are difficulties in the current service and there are reasons for making it more organised. However, it is naive to suggest this will result in an end to all our problems. The Minister stated the health strategy will bring about, "better health for everyone, fair access, responsive and appropriate care delivery and high performance". He also stated there are too many agencies and the service is too fragmented. He did not mention a health ombudsman or anything else that might improve the situation. The Minister also referred to:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_360">a major rationalisation of existing health service agencies, including the abolition of the existing health board-authority structures; the establishment of a health services executive, which will be the first ever body charged with managing the health service as a single national entity . . . the establishment of a health information and quality authority to ensure that quality of care is promoted throughout the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I will read no more of the speech because what the Minister said was meaningless. I do not mean that in any derogatory sense because that is not the way I operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">We must consider what is happening at present. Only last week the Minister provided an outline of how well he is doing in terms of reducing waiting lists. I was visited in my office this morning by an aged lady who was making representations on behalf of her 79 year old husband who has been seeking help with his hip problem for the past three years but who, as yet, has not been placed on a waiting list. It is easy to state that waiting lists are being reduced if people are not allowed to be included on them. It is as if they do not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I was contacted by a young man in connection with his three year old daughter. The man in question also has a four year old son and a year ago he had to bring him to a Dublin hospital to have his tonsillitis treated. The child's throat was literally closed and the man asked when the child would be dealt with. He was informed it would take three years. When he asked what would happen if he went private, he was told it would only take two weeks. He was obliged to part with €1,300 in order to have the operation carried out. A year later, he is again desperate because his three year old daughter has a similar problem. He is hoping the operation can be done at Omagh. These are the types of matters with which Members must deal in their clinics on an ordinary day.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I cannot help but think about the family of a man who had a heart attack the other day. He was rushed to one of the major hospitals in Dublin at 5.30 p.m. He was 22nd on the list for treatment and was cared for by a junior doctor between 5.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. However, the doctor's shift ended at that time and it was approximately 9 p.m. or 9.30 p.m. before the man was dealt with and he passed away. How must his family feel today? We have all seen footage on television of ambulances with their sirens sounding arriving at hospitals and being awaited by emergency teams. Hospital staff used to be able to do that and they should still be in a position to do it. However, Monaghan hospital and other hospitals are now off call and services are being grouped at centres of excellence that are not yet prepared to deal with people.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">As a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I was recently privileged to be part of an inquiry into health services in particular areas. One of the places we visited was the Isle of Man. People may say that money from this country has been invested there illegally and that it has adequate funding as a result. However, I saw how the service there operates. A new 314 bed hospital was built within four years for a population of 75,000 to 85,000 people, depending on the number of holidaymakers in the area. The new hospital will have 24 new consultants and does not seem to have any trouble getting personnel. The charge on the taxpayer for the health service there is just a little higher than what we charge, about half as much again. They apologised because they have a waiting list of six months for a person needing a hip operation, but they hope to reduce that time to three months shortly with the six new theatres in the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">On another occasion we visited a hospital outside Cardiff to see a new modern midwife-led childbirth service. A similar service was promised for Monaghan, but nothing has happened. We then went up to Wick, 108 miles north of Inverness and 15 miles short of John O'Groats. There the maternity service was under pressure with only about 200 patients using it in a year, I think it may have closed since.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">That visit opened my eyes to what is wrong with our system. The Minister's personal adviser was with us on the trip and he pointed out that there was nobody in the emergency unit of the hospital we visited. It is true it was not under pressure, but it was at least able to provide a service to any patients who turned up and to ensure they were safe to travel the 108 miles to Inverness.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">We also visited the health care service there where five or six doctors worked. They ran an ultra modern health service providing care at primary care level for people so that they do not have to end up at the accident and emergency unit. This service is provided free, which makes all the difference. The Minister should remember that a promise was made before the general election that 200,000 extra medical cards would be provided. However, a reply to a parliamentary question indicates that instead some 47,000 cards have been withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">I listened to a colleague from the Fianna Fáil party and Deputy Olivia Mitchell argue on radio about the issue. The Fianna Fáil Deputy said the reason the cards were removed was because all of the people involved were on such good incomes that they no longer needed the cards. This is one of the biggest issues in my office on a daily basis. People with genuine long-term illness have their medical cards removed and their families are in dire distress. If the Minister does nothing else, he should fulfil the commitment to deliver the extra 200,000 medical cards. He should also restore the 47,000 which have been withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I cannot help reminding the House of an 87 year old woman who has to take care of her adult disabled children. She worries about what will happen when her life ends or when she is no longer able to look after them. The "Prime Time" programme on RTE last night dealt with the area of autism. When will this Government pass the disability Bill which will give some rights to people who desperately need help? I did not have the opportunity to see the programme last night. However, I heard snippets on the radio. It would make anybody cry that so many people are enduring so much distress at a time when this country was never as well off financially. Some €500 million more than expected has been added to the kitty from taxes and €150 million extra has come in from dormant accounts. Money is also available from other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I beg the Minister to do what is necessary to get Monaghan General Hospital re-opened on call to provide a proper service to people. He appointed Kevin Bonnar to examine the issue and said that €14 million was necessary for the service. The Minister has decided he will provide €2.75 million. In order to provide some comfort to hospitals such as Ennis, Nenagh and other hospitals around the country, the least the Minister should do is to treat Monaghan General Hospital with some dignity and respect and bring it back on call.</p>

          <from>Mr. Moloney</from>
          <p eId="para_374">I welcome this debate. I also welcome the changes proposed in the Health (Amendment) Bill 2004 as they are a key part of the Government's reform of the health service as announced last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">I recognise, as anybody should, that there is always room for improvement in the health services and no matter how much was spent in recent years, further improvement must always be welcome. However, I cannot close my eyes to the huge improvements that have already taken place, particularly those in my constituency and health board area over the past seven years. Members may point out that years ago services were always readily available in their local hospitals. However, the reality is that most people from the rural health board areas headed to Dublin for treatment. Therefore, it was quite easy to provide the limited service required in those hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I welcome the changes I have seen over seven years which I am sure are consistent with changes in most health board areas throughout the country. Government policy has insisted that we have services in the regions, and this has happened. My area, which is covered by the Midland Health Board, is not much different from other areas and I have seen huge capital investment in my local hospital in Portlaoise. In the past month the Minister for Health visited to open the new paediatric and the new acute psychiatric units. There have been major improvements in the hospital's services.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">If one examined the information from the headquarters in Tullamore, one would recognise the huge increase in the throughput of patients in every faculty of the hospital and recognise that services have improved, that the throughput of patients has grown and that the level of confidence in hospital services has improved. I see the changes as positive. Services are dealing with the issues on the ground and providing a service. In my time as a health board member I have seen better ENT, orthodontic and cancer services in my region.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Great play has been made of the fact that this Bill mentions the abolition of health boards. People are trying to tie a noose around the Government's neck by suggesting this is anti-democratic and they suggest that removing public representatives from health boards is a way of removing the local voice by stealth. I do not wish to go against colleagues who have been health board members; I was on the health board in County Laois for 20 years. However, my experience is that when a member from the Government side tried to improve services or secure services for our region, opposition members felt it had to be opposed straight away, purely because we had a Fianna Fáil administration and that created the impression it was a Government proposed motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">For example, in 1994 we proposed the location of a regional cancer service in Tullamore. I learned then that the involvement of public representatives from the different counties of the health board area acted as a deterrent, unfortunately, towards attracting services. I welcome the changes because I saw the huge pressure brought to bear on public representatives to insist that whatever improvements would occur, they would occur in the county of the strongest public representative.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The Minister speaks in the Bill about the need to move forward and progress quickly. I welcome the change the Minister is initiating. Approximately 1,200 people in our region present each year with cancer-related illness, 1,000 of whom must travel to Dublin for treatment. Even though funding was allocated and services committed to by way of a regional cancer strategy, non-Government members of our health board went through the nonsense of a High Court action to create the impression that they had fought their damnedest to secure the service for the county. In the meantime there was a delay of four years in providing the service. Any change in that regard is, therefore, welcome. I sincerely welcome the removal of pressure to provide a service from local public representatives who acknowledge they will have a role in a regional structure and are glad to have that pressure removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">I have often made the point at health board meetings that while public representatives have a role in deciding on the level of funding under different specialities at the annual Estimates meetings, medical issues should be left to consultant or medical representatives. Having learned from the sad experience of the row about cancer services in the midland region, the only region to wind up in the High Court, I proposed that from then on, whenever the Department signalled the possibility of new services for a region, it should be left to the medical representatives from each county, not the public representatives, to make recommendations to the health board on the location of services, particularly in health board areas with two or three acute hospitals delivering service. The experience in my region brought home to me the point under discussion in the debate on this Bill. The consultants on the board could not make a recommendation. If the consultants could not do so, how could a public representative? I, therefore, welcome any change to remove pressure from public representatives regarding the location of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">I agree with the Minister that the current system has served us well for more than 30 years, and recognise the major role played by the health boards in those years. However, few public or private companies operate under the same structures and guidelines for more than 30 years. If we are to have a world class health service, we need structures that can move to provide such a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">I recognise that, given the problems that could arise, making progress is important. That is why the Minister has brought forward this legislation. By his own admission it is of an interim nature. Nevertheless, it represents an important step. I do not see the decision to remove public representatives as a measure to undermine democracy or local involvement. There will be room for that as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Another part of the legislation deals with assigning the various powers of the authority to the CEOs and the Minister for Health and Children. Such measures are necessary if we are to make progress. If we want to achieve reform quickly, we need a streamlined executive structure so that the necessary measures can be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The reform of the health service will pose a number of challenges, including the need for the various bodies of the service to pull in the same direction and make decisions quickly. There would not be much point in increasing the level of spending each year if decisions are not quickly made and adhered to. The old structures were often accused of being unwieldy. This Bill will correct that.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">The decision to transfer any decisions with regard to the purchase and disposal of property is another necessary step. For years the land purchase committee was often under extreme pressure from different areas within the health services. I am glad we are dealing with that issue as well. We must have a central decision-making process. We cannot have each area making decisions that might be of benefit locally but which fail to take account of the bigger picture. That is what the Government's health service strategy is about. It is about examining the overall scenario and ensuring that we provide a service for the country of which we can be proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">It will be difficult to change old ways. Colleagues who served on health boards for years express the belief that they will be left out of the decision-making process. However, some health boards operating within the guidelines have suffered, particularly my own. I have often wondered why all of the health boards could not act in step with one another. For years the health board on which I served operated within budget and provided a service plan that remained within budget, while other boards exceeded their budget. Those health boards were not penalised and were able to provide more services and it was often pointed out that my health board had a marked lack of services compared to other health boards. If people check the records of the early 1970s, they will find one reason was that my health board could never agree on the location of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I thank the Chair for allowing me to contribute. I wish the Minister and the Ministers of State well in steering this Bill through the House and recognise that serious attempts have been made to resolve the difficulties within the health service.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_205">
          <from>Dr. Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_389">I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak on the Health (Amendment) Bill 2004. Everyone in this House is aware that improvements are needed in the health service, despite the great work being done by people who work in the service both at a clinical and administrative level and despite the enormous amount of money that has been allocated in recent years. I have said repeatedly, and I will repeat it again tonight, that the most important person in the health service is the patient and yet some patients are unhappy with the service. That unhappiness appears to be centred on long waiting lists for certain specialties and overcrowding in the accident and emergency departments of some hospitals. Only today I came across a patient who had been waiting an incredibly long time for an orthodontic appointment. Deputy Olivia Mitchell on the opposite side of the House is well aware of the problems that exist in that specialty.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Recognising these problems, the Minister has undertaken a comprehensive review of the health service in its totality. These problems and their solutions have been clearly signalled in the three reports published recently, namely, Brennan, Prospectus and Hanly. One of the issues identified as needing reform has been the structure of health boards. I spent a considerable time working for a health board, the North Western Health Board. It is one of the better health boards, if not the best. I do not say this purely from a parochial point of view but from experience gained from listening and talking to members of the public and Members of the House from all sides. However, the present structure of health administration dates from the 1970s and it is not best suited to deal with the complexities of health administration in the 21st century.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The health strategy clearly identified the need to have a consistent national approach to the delivery of health services based on clear and agreed national objectives. The key element of the reform of the health service is the rationalisation of the existing health service agencies which will involve the abolition of the existing health boards. In the case of the North Western Health Board, I shall be saddened to see its abolition but in the light of the evidence presented by the reports I have just mentioned, the overall improvement of the health service requires new structures. I hope the end result will be a health service executive which will be responsible for managing the service as a national entity.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Last week the chairman of the interim Health Service Executive, Mr. Kevin Kelly and some members of this interim board appeared before the Dáil health committee. I was very impressed with the level of consultation they are undertaking with all interested bodies in the health service before the executive is established next January. I take this opportunity to wish them well in their very important task because the success of the very necessary reforms depend on the successful operation of this very important structure that is the Health Service Executive. The end result of this reform programme will be a health service which will improve patient care and that is something everyone wants. The Bill is the first stage in the legislative process to bring about that reform. It is somewhat ironic that some members of the Opposition oppose that process. Having listened carefully to what they have said, it appears that many of them have fears about the perceived lack of democratic accountability in the new structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I welcome the Minister's clear indication of his intention to bring forward opportunities for democratic input in the new health service structure. I particularly welcome the proposal to establish regional forums to allow local representatives to raise with the new executive their concerns about the health service within their regions. The membership of the forums will be based on nominations from local authorities. Therefore, the input of public representatives into the health service will be maintained. It is important that local councillors have an input into the running of the health service in their own areas so that their voices will continue to be heard as things happen in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I also welcome the proposal in the Bill to increase the role of the Joint Committee on Health and Children. I have mentioned that the chairman of the interim Health Service Executive has appeared before the committee. I foresee an expanded role for the committee under this legislation, as it will mean that issues raised by constituents can be put directly to members of the executive. This open and accountable process is already happening in other Dáil committees. I am sure the members of the joint committee, including all the main Opposition health spokespersons, will relish their increasingly important role as public watchdogs.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">A considerable number of places on health boards are reserved for health professionals, such as doctors, pharmacists and nurses. I welcome the Minister's recent announcement that arrangements will be made to allow such professionals to express their views. The voices of patients, who are the users of the service, have been overlooked in the past, however. It is true that some health boards have established consumer panels, but it should be done on a more formal basis. I urge the Minister to proceed with such panels as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">While the health boards have served the country well for the past 34 years, generally, the evidence of the exhaustive review of the Irish health service is that more appropriate structures need to be put in place for the modern age. The Bill is the first step in that process and I commend the Minister for bringing it to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_399">A myriad of reports has been issued during the term in office of the Minister for Health and Children and under the auspices of the Government since 1997. I do not believe the Government's intention in producing such reports has been to illuminate the needs of the health service and to address those needs into the future. The reports have been requested and provided on a political basis to allow the Government to engage in prevarication and to delay the reforms that are required. Many of us believe that reforms can be implemented to enable a fair and efficient health service to exist. One can wonder why such a service does not exist. I do not doubt that we continue to suffer through the efforts of various vested interests, who are unwilling to put in place the necessary changes to allow us to bring about such a fair and efficient service.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_401">I will name some of them if the Minister of State allows me to continue. The changes being suggested in the Bill do not address the issues I have mentioned, just as many of the reports that have been issued do not answer the questions that need to be answered. The Bill is an exercise in moving the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic</i>. The fundamental question of the needs of the health service continues to be ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">There is an obsession with the administration of the health service, rather than an interest in making clear the philosophy that should underlie the service. We need to consider how best to achieve and maintain a philosophy of the "wellness" of citizens. The Minister, Deputy Martin, and his Government colleagues have never addressed how "wellness" can best be regained if it is not available to individual citizens. Such problems are further entrenched by the legislation before the House today, which underlines the Government's poverty of thinking in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">We have been obsessed with the administration of the health service throughout the history of the State. It has to be acknowledged that the Department of Health and Children has had various manifestations. It did not exist when the State came into being. It became an adjunct of the then Department of Local Government, before becoming a fully fledged Department in its own right. Many Governments have been uncertain about how best to deal with health as a political issue. I am afraid that such confusion continues to exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Given that there is such an obsession with the administration of the health service and the political packaging that surrounds it, many people are concerned about the extent to which elected public representatives can and should be represented in the process. How should resources be allocated within the health service? Who should make such decisions? We are avoiding the fundamental questions because of our obsession. We have Cinderella services in areas such as preventative health care, community care and mental health care. All such areas would benefit from a more open and imaginative political approach. The political structures we allowed to develop will be allowed to continue in the future, albeit in a more modified form. The Cinderella aspect of many important areas of health care will continue to be overlooked because they are not deemed to be political priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Successive Governments have continued to make mistakes in respect of mental health care in the community. I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, has had to leave the Chamber because he is directly responsible for this area. There continues to be a Dickensian aspect to mental health services, even in the 21st century. The moves that have been made in recent decades to move people from institutional care to community settings have been badly thought-out. Measures have often been taken in the interests of financial savings to the health service, rather than the medical care of individuals. The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, may shake his head but this has been the experience of individuals who have encountered aspects of that service and whose relatives have endured aspects of the service. The Government is not addressing such issues, but prefers to concern itself with the administrative structure of the health service.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_411">I will not embarrass the Chair by pointing out that gaps in provision are being bridged not by formal State structures or the Government's policies but by this country's well-committed, if under-resourced, voluntary sector. A more caring and prescient Government would be prepared to bridge such gaps.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">I have given one reason this amending Bill is deficient, but two further matters need to be tackled as part of the reform of the health service. Nobody denies that proper organisation is needed, but I would like to concentrate on the need for proper resourcing. The myth has been allowed to develop that we do not need to worry about funding any more because enough money is being invested in the health service. If one examines international comparisons, however, one will see that we spend less <i>per capita</i> and as a percentage of our gross national product than other European countries. We will be unable to provide the level of service that is found in other countries until we reach that level.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">It is important for the organisation of the health service that it is dual-tracked. We have to recognise that the health service should have regional and a local components. There is also a need at a small level for a national body to achieve appropriate economies of scale to give us the best value for our money in the health service. The Minister's proposal to reduce the number of health authorities from 11 to four does not represent a step in the right direction. Regarding many aspects of public health care delivery, it could be argued that much of the health service should be decentralised into local and regional government structures. It is a weakness of Irish local government that we have our health system and aspects of our education systems separate from our local government decision-making bodies, albeit with some nomination rights at VEC and health board levels. In other countries, the delivery of health services and education is an intrinsic part of regional and local government. If the Government was truly concerned about proper reform of our health services, it would be willing to put such structures in place. Unfortunately, this is another missed opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">There is also the issue of people's experience of the health service in terms of the current level of resourcing. My mother was an out-patient nurse in a busy city centre hospital in Cork for 20 years. A number of years ago, my daughter injured her hand in a car door and went to the accident and emergency unit in that hospital. What we saw there shocked my mother, who had worked there for decades previously. The staff were no less caring than they had been, but they were under much more pressure and decisions were being made in that unit which are being replicated in accident and emergency units throughout the country. The decisions are not always medical and often relate to other areas and resources. My daughter had the misfortune of being injured on a Saturday evening and had to compete for accident and emergency space with people in various stages of intoxication being brought by ambulance to the unit. That is where the priority was given on that night in that unit because the staff feared that if those intoxicated people were not dealt with, violence might occur. This happened some years ago, yet I recently received a similar complaint from a constituent. His young son suffered a head wound and was brought into another accident and emergency unit in Cork city. There he was asked to wait for several hours without being tended to, while the parent was asked to maintain pressure on the child's wound until trained medical staff could treat him.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Such situations are the weekly reality for many people using our accident and emergency services. The Government is prepared to stand over such situations and promise that somehow, without bringing in the necessary resources, this rearranging of the deckchairs will change the reality of life for people. The Government is compounding the deceit it has been so willing to spread during the last general election when it promised that waiting lists would by now be a thing of the past.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_217">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_416">Sinn Fein's health spokesperson, Deputy Ó Caoláin, stated at the beginning of this debate that this is an enabling Bill for a legislative and political stroke to vest all the powers of the health boards in their CEOs and the Minister for Health and Children for an indefinite period.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Recent events at Louth County Hospital and the conduct of the CEO of the North Eastern Health Board regarding those events act as a timely reminder of the dangers inherent in vesting increased powers in CEOs. The people of Louth were horrified to discover in recent weeks that surgical services at Louth County Hospital are to be closed after 5 p.m. daily from 1 July next, effectively taking the hospital off call. This is the latest in a line of cutbacks and closures at the hospital. The children's ward, the maternity ward and the gynaecological ward have already been closed. The people of Louth are being told that this further closure is, as was said about previous closures, a wonderful boost for the hospital and the people of the area. How can anyone say that? The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, repeated this assertion in the House last week when he stated: "Far from being a downgrading of the service in Dundalk, this is an enhancement of the service".</p>
          <p eId="para_418">How did this latest cutback of services at Louth County Hospital come about? I will explain briefly. Amazingly, the North Eastern Health Board sent the proposal to Comhairle na nOspidéal saying that the medical board of Louth County Hospital had been consulted and had agreed to the proposal regarding the surgical services cutback. This was a blatant lie, making the North Eastern Health Board submission to Comhairle na nOspidéal a fraudulent document. The people of Louth have a right to know who signed this document. They need to know that someone in the North Eastern Health Board will be held accountable for the actions of the health board regarding Louth County Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Is anyone accountable any longer in the North Eastern Health Board management? How much longer will this level of gross incompetence be allowed continue? Does the Department of Health and Children give even a fleeting glance to what is going on in that area? It appears it does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">As a result of being fed misinformation, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, misled this House last week by stating that surgical staff at the Louth hospital were in favour of these proposed closures. This is not the case. Why are paid public servants being allowed to tell lies and get away with it? This is scandalous.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The proposal to end surgical services after 5 p.m. daily is also very dubious from a best practice perspective. It has been described by the medical board of Louth County Hospital as an unsafe practice. The nursing staff at the hospital have been deeply angered by this decision and said it will place the lives of their patients in danger. They are so angry they have organised a protest march in Dundalk for 31 May from the hospital to the town square. The people of Dundalk will no doubt turn out in large numbers to say to the health board and the Minister that they will not sit back and watch while their hospital services are obliterated.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Who is going to intervene to examine what is going on? How can we introduce same modicum of control to senior management in the health board? The Department will not do so. Last week I called for the CEO of the North Eastern Health Board to be suspended pending an investigation into this botched affair. I repeat that call today in light of a litany of emergencies in the North Eastern Health Board area.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The North Eastern Health Board operates more on spin than on substance. We had a further example of its spin yesterday. Last night, on "Six-One News" a North Eastern Health Board spokesperson claimed it was necessary for the board to introduce the closure so as to comply with an EU directive that must be implemented by 1 July. When I checked with the health board today, it admitted it was referring to the European working time directive which related to working hours for junior doctors. This directive will have only very minor effects in terms of the proposed surgical services closure at the Louth hospital. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, attempted to explain this when I raised it with him in the House last week by saying: "The reorganisation of surgical services as announced by the health board is designed <i> inter alia </i>to facilitate a more appropriate training system in that junior doctors will rotate between the two hospitals during their employment, thus ensuring exposure to many different clinical experiences”.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Are the people of County Louth to accept the destruction of their health services based on this explanation? They will not do so. I commend my colleague, councillor Tomás Sharkey, for moving a emergency motion at Louth County Council to hold a special meeting to debate the issue. I understand that Dundalk Town Council is debating it as we speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Action is needed now. There is a serious crisis at senior management level in the North Eastern Health Board area. I implore the Department of Health and Children to send in an inspector and hold some sort of investigation. Until that happens, until people establish what is going on and understand the litany of catastrophes, the situation will worsen. Senior people in the Department of Health and Children must realise at this stage what is going on. I ask them to live up to their responsibilities by dealing with the crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill because it is one of the important legislative reforms necessary to deliver health service reform and provide a refined and radically improved health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">God knows we are paying for a first class health system but how many would claim it is being delivered. The Government is rising to that challenge in parts of its health reform programme and this Bill sets the ball rolling.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Everybody is familiar with the joke "How many people does it take to change a light bulb?" However, it is no joke to ask how many people does it take to make a policy for the health service. Certainly not 263. As the Tánaiste said at the launch of the health reform programme, we do not need 263 health board members in addition to the 166 Dáil Deputies and 60 Senators to make policy for the health services of a population of 3.9 million. This is the central point at the heart of the Bill and of the reform of the health services. We do not have 11 health services in the country, we have one and the system of governance should reflect that.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">One of the great flaws of the present system, is that health boards have influence on making and implementing policy, without having to take responsibility to raise tax to back their proposals. Health board members do not have to face direct election to the board by the people whose lives they affect. It is inevitable that when a crisis hits, public concern is raised and responsibility is all too often passed like a hot potato to the Minister. When there is any trouble, it is as if patient, bed, ward and ambulance is the personal responsibility of the Minister of the Government in power. This is familiar to all Ministers who have held the health portfolio. It is part of the absurdity of the governance of health.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Health boards have statutory responsibilities, but all too often the boards escape political responsibility. Since political responsibility is always passed to central government, we may as well have a single executive and a unified system of governance of the health service. That is the logic of the Bill. It is not as if the health boards have provided a model of accountability and effectiveness in their functions. The Brennan report, Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service, gave some stark and simple instances of some very basic failures — unapproved capital spending, unauthorised staff appointments, late and inadequate accounts. To be fair, the Brennan report did not confine its critique to health boards, but that does not take from the relevance of what it said about them. It highlighted that between 1998 and 2000:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_431">of the eight health boards then in existence, all but one received an unsatisfactory audit report [from the Comptroller and Auditor General] at least once in the three year period . . . .</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_432">in the case of one of the eight health boards, its audit report was unsatisfactory in all three years examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">In a devastating comment, the Brennan report remarked on the new Eastern Regional Health Authority:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_434">At the date of completing this report (January 2003) the year 2000 audit report for the Eastern Regional Health Authority is not yet to hand. By statute, the audit should have been completed by 30 September 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">If this happened in large companies, shareholders would sell out, regulators would require immediate corrections, suppliers would give no trade credit and banks would pull back on overdraft. The media and politicians would be raising a storm about corporate incompetence. What happened — nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">If one casts one's mind back to the period 1998 to 2000, does anyone remember any of the 263 health board members being under political, media or public pressure to take responsibility for these failures? Absolutely not.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">If the truth were told, has it not become the case that failures in the health boards have become accepted and people just shrug their shoulders. Thankfully, that will end.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Leaving aside political responsibility, our present system serves little purpose either in terms of health service planning or delivery. The Prospectus report demonstrated this conclusively.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_441">There is a clear need for consistent health service strategy and consistent health service delivery across the country — not for the sake of the Minister or the Government but for the sake of the patients and clients of our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The argument is also made that there is a need for a democratic input and accountability for health service planning and delivery. The Minister intends to allow structured input from elected representatives, but we can ill afford local political turf battles to interfere with the delivery of health services consistently around the country. People's concerns should focus on the quality and availability of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Members who believe that the new Health Service Executive will be unaccountable because its board reports to the Minister for Health and Children who in turn reports to the Oireachtas has a poor view of the oversight of the Oireachtas. Some of my colleagues made a point that the Committee on Health and Children, of which I am a member, had the health service executive before it, and a very impressive organisation it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">No one has responded to anything the committee has done. For five years we have been trying to have something done about orthodontics. Deputy Cowley, who is in the Chair also tried to improve the delivery of the orthodontic service.</p>

          <from>Ms F. O’Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_445">We have every faith it will deliver. At the end of last year when it was discovered that two health boards had not spent all their allocation, the health boards were called before the Health and Children Committee of the Oireachtas, the parliament of the people to account for it. I do not see how this will change.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Deputy Devins raised the issue, but it demonstrates a lack of faith and commitment and interest in the Oireachtas committee, if one thinks that accountability will stop because local councillors are not on a committee. The reporting lines proposed in the Health Service Executive are the same as those of many existing executive bodies. The chief executive of the Health Service Executive will be an Accounting Officer, and therefore subject to the highest degree of direct scrutiny by the committees of the Oireachtas and the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Minister has proposed structured consultation with local elected representatives in the management of health services locally, which is a worthwhile complement to the governance structure proposed for the Health Service Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_448">My greatest fear about the Health (Amendment) Bill is that it will be used primarily to cover up for future catastrophes rather than as a tool to start the reform of the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">I fully support the abolition of the health boards because they were of questionable benefit when their managerial or executive function was assessed, but they had one vital use as far as I was concerned, they were a great source of information as to how the Government was running the health services in different parts of the country. The regional health boards showed up the glaring inequalities that exist in the health service in different parts of the country. One of the dangers of having one body is that information that is so vital in a democracy will disappear. Information is the key to ministerial accountability and is also the lock that prevents further incompetence and corruption in how we deal with taxpayer's money. There is no guarantee that, as Members of the Oireachtas we will continue to have access to the type of information that can currently be obtained from the health boards. There is nothing in this Bill that will give us more information about how the health services will be run after 2004. We may only have parliamentary questions to obtain information and be given the same nonsensical answers that we often get currently. This is a very important issue as Deputies will be taking over the role of the county councillors after 2004. We will be the watchdogs of the health services and even though fine words has been said about the Committee on Health and Children, we know that downright lies have been told to the Committee on Health and Children and information is not exactly very forthcoming when we try to seek it out. A scandal similar to the hepatitis C scandal could occur and could certainly happen in an environment where information is covered up and there is no access to it. Not only that, but millions of taxpayers money can be thrown away and squandered on all sorts of building works, expenditure and wasted taking on staff without knowing what they are needed for. Again, getting this information can be difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I wish to read a quote into the record. "To deliver transparent, reliable and accessible services that offer our customers choice, convenience and value for money." That sounds like the mission statement of a well-respected, competitive company but it is a statement made to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service by a senior official responsible for retail banking in AIB last year. He was either being economical with the truth or he did not know what was going on under his watch. I will not accuse the official of lying but if he was unfortunate enough to find out what was happening in retail banking in regard to foreign exchange services next year, instead of putting his €24 million on deposit, he could have been fined €24 million by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. Unfortunately, the legislation needed to fine the bank will not be enacted until later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">We can easily be given rubbish as information if we do not have a method to clarify it or to institute penalties for bad information. Transparency and accountability are important. Unfortunately, we are leaving it up to the media to inform the electorate as to what is happening in regard to Government. We seem to be ignoring the words "transparency" and "accountability". They are thrown around every report by Government but they do not operate in practice. It is important members of the Government pay attention to them and not only see them as fine words to be thrown out at meetings because they are the essence of democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Tonight's Private Members' business is a motion about instances where Ministers have leaped without looking, where they have become bogged down in pet projects and where it has taken millions of euro to get them out. These Ministers should remain accountable to the Dáil, whether these pet projects go pear shaped accidentally or deliberately. We need to know whether Ministers are abusing their ministerial power and are incompetent. We would not look for resignations every time but we need to know what is happening. It would help to ensure good use of taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The Government has an annual budget exceeding €35 billion, yet so much of this money seems to be just thrown away, and tonight's motion will only touch on some of that. In some cases, people may have got a little ahead of themselves, such as in the case of the Abbotstown project where the national stadium was due to be built. The State Laboratory was moved and millions of euro were spent on certain ground works which no longer seem to be needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Most people who oppose the Hanly report do not do so outright — they oppose recommendations in it which are bad for patient care. To a degree, I agree with some that it may be used a little in the upcoming local and European Parliament elections. What is the definition of a "parish pump politician"? I would like that question to be answered when we are talking about issues such as the health services and accountability therein. Why is there a five-storey building in Mullingar in which four-storeys do not even have windows? What happened in Mullingar between 1985 and 2004 where somebody built a five-storey building but before construction finished, it was decided that the extra four storeys were not needed? What about the hospital in Blanchardstown which was practically rebuilt but which is not open because somebody says there is no funding or staff, or there are other problems? Does one not find it silly to talk about accountability and who is supposed to be accountable when these buildings are sitting on health board or Department of Health and Children land yet we have no idea what purpose they serve and nobody seems to want to offer a reason as to the purpose they serve?</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is spending €50 million on a new obstetrics hospital on the grounds of Cork University Hospital. This €50 million will pay for a new hospital with 25 new labour suites, 50 new neonatal beds and many other facilities for obstetrics for the Cork region. There is also an obstetrics unit in Tralee General Hospital in County Kerry. The South Eastern Health Board region has the same number of births per annum, 5,700, yet it must increase charges in the car park to take on extra paediatricians to look after the children born in that region.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">The hospital in Tullamore is another case in point. It was without question the Cinderella of the three hospitals in the Midlands Health Board region until it had the luck that the prince became the Minister for Health and Children. Tullamore Hospital was suddenly brought up to the status of a regional hospital and had its future secured because the Minister for Health and Children at the time managed to get millions of euro invested in it. That is parish pump politics. That is investment in the health services which has more to do with political reasons than implementing Government health policies. Despite all this fine talk about the Hanly and Prospectus reports, nothing I have seen in the past two years indicates to me there is any genuine reform of the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The alternative to the health boards is the Health Service Executive. It is great to see AIB again turn up in terms of the alternative to running the health services. Mr. Peter Kelly is overseeing it. To my knowledge, none of the members of this new board have any direct frontline experience or have any idea what it is like to work on the frontline, yet they will dictate policy. In some respects, one could say it is just as well they do not because whoever wrote the Hanly report does not seem to have had too much frontline experience as far as the health services outside Cork, Dublin and Galway are concerned. There is no doubt about that in my mind. Since all the public upset about the Hanly report has emerged, the only clear answers we are getting are from members of the medical service involved in writing up the report. I was at the Irish Medical Organisation conference in Killarney when Dr. Cillian Twomey, who was one of the authors of the report, made it quite clear that the Hanly report was not to be implemented until the primary care strategy was implemented and until issues such as the upgrading of the ambulance service were addressed. It may not be important to the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, because he comes from a Dublin constituency and he has little understanding of what happens in many rural constituencies——</p>

          <p eId="para_461">If it is not true, one would wonder why it was allowed to go forward because it is not a serious piece of medical policy in regard to reform of the health services outside Dublin, Cork and Galway. Passing remarks were made on two issues, including the ambulance service. Fewer than half of the ambulance crews are emergency medical technicians. The other half are still at the stage of advanced first aid training. None of them are legally entitled to work as paramedics. One needs to be a paramedic if one is to carry a fairly sick patient from the site of an accident on the side of the road to a regional hospital. Not to remark on that shows a clear lack of knowledge.</p>

          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_467">How the ambulance service is to be changed is not mentioned, yet that is fundamental. The report mentions that the primary care strategy must be implemented but we know where that is going. Of the 400 primary care centres envisaged in the course of this plan, which began two years ago and is to cover ten years, less than ten have been started but I am not saying they have been finished. That is not going very far, yet they are two vital components.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The Hanly report did not touch on the issue of tertiary services and I was quite surprised by that omission, considering that we are reforming the health services. The existing tertiary services include neurosurgery, although some people think we do not have such surgery because they cannot gain access to it. The same goes for other significant tertiary services, such as the liver transplant unit at St. Vincent's Hospital and the heart transplant unit in the Mater Hospital. Nobody ever examined those services to see what should be done with them — whether for instance, they should be bunched together into one hospital. Perhaps we should ask the national treatment purchase fund to change its remit from doing toenails and hernias to seeking to provide tertiary services from abroad, because ours is only a small country of four million people.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">The case of the young man in County Kerry who requires a lung transplant is unfortunate in so far as the Minister for Health and Children does not have much control over the situation. When we read about that case we also heard that the Mater Hospital is spending €4 million this year to do two lung transplant operations. Over the course of the next few years it will spend €60 million to set up a lung transplant unit.</p>

        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_236">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_471">Hanly referred to closing down acute surgical services in many of the smaller hospitals around the country. Some of those hospitals had out-patient and accident and emergency units attended by 16,000 patients per annum. The Hanly report said such small hospitals should be closed down because they do not have critical mass or enough cases per annum to justify spending money on having them on call 24 hours a day. However, we do not seem to apply the same logic to lung or liver transplants. Are we to set up a lung transplant unit that will do two cases per annum? If that is the case, perhaps the Government is right to revert to having a hospital at every cross-roads because, on that basis, as long as one or two operations are done per year, one might be able to justify their existence. Much of what is being said is illogical and I am annoyed because every opportunity is taken by Government speakers to condemn me and other opposition speakers. The Acting Chairman and I are trained medical practitioners and, while we may not know everything, we have a good idea of what is going on in our respective areas. We know quite well that the Hanly report simply cannot work. It would be disastrous if anybody tried to implement the report, as I read it or, worse again, along the lines of what I heard about it before the local elections became an issue. That has been confirmed by many consultants who have taken the trouble to read it. This is why accountability and transparency in Government decision making is so important. The Government should be able to take criticism on the chin and, to some degree, the Minister, Deputy Martin, is able to do so. He is able to appreciate that sometimes one needs to listen to what is being said on this side of the House. There are fatal flaws in the Government's policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, was unfortunate in letting himself become embroiled in the current situation, where another €60 million is coming up for discussion. Before we have to round off our working lives with a tribunal into the current health services, we should examine seriously what we are doing. Some €10 billion is being spent but we should have a good idea of how it will be spent after the health boards are abolished. I would not be too keen on the South Eastern Health Board and the Southern Health Board regions being lumped together. As it stands, Cork University Hospital seems to be absorbing the vast bulk of the Southern Health Board's resources. If that pattern continues in the south east, we will definitely see some of our hospitals being downgraded and shut down to feed the monster that is Cork University Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">No great consideration is being given to primary care services or general practitioners' services, even in the Minister of State, Deputy Callely's, constituency. He is probably well aware that there is one GP for 2,500 patients on the north side of Dublin, whereas the national average is 1,500 patients per GP. Therefore, there is already a deficit in the services on the north side of Dublin. It does not come as any great surprise that Beaumont and the Mater have the busiest accident and emergency departments. They are providing a very expensive type of health service but that money is being thrown away. It demonstrates a poor understanding of what general practice is all about. Perhaps because GP work is not very glamorous, not enough is being spent on looking after such patients, and so general practice is being run into the ground. I have not heard anything from the Department of Health and Children to show that it appreciates there is any impending crisis in general practice, even though some parts of the capital city are already facing such a crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">The Bill aims to get rid of health boards and transfer their functions to four new regional authorities and a health service executive, but that executive will be unaccountable to the people. Given the way in which the new system will be structured, the Minister also will not be accountable. That issue is growing in importance politically.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">When I submit questions to the Minister I am sometimes told that he has no responsibility in regard to them, whereas I might obtain a response more quickly if I submitted them to the newspapers which would find them quite interesting. Some of these questions make perfect sense to me but the lack of response means that the disastrous situations we are discussing, and that are considered to be Government policy, could be implemented yet it would be difficult to discover what is going on. If we are to radically reform the health service and get county councillors off the new regional health authorities, at the very least Members of the Oireachtas should still be able to gain access to information so that they will know everything is being done in the name of the people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_237">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_476">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak about this legislation. I disagree profoundly with Deputy Fiona O'Malley's assessment. It may well be true that in some circumstances debates at health board meetings did not represent the epitome of the distilled knowledge of the wider community, but it was democracy. It gave an opportunity for elected representatives to give their tuppence worth, to say their piece and represent those who had elected them. If they did not do so, they would not be re-elected. It may well be that the level of debate was parochial from time to time and may have related to issues that were seen by some sophisticated administrators as being outside the remit of public representatives, but it was still democracy. It was a system whereby the public had a representative view and a voice on the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The proposed change has nothing to do with democracy, accountability or saving money. It has everything to do with centralised control, which is fast becoming the hallmark not only of the health services but of many other services. Two Departments are the greatest sinners: the Department of Health and Children, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In recent times, a third Department has begun to show tendencies towards centralised control.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The main reason health boards are now being abolished is to coincide with what was seen as a necessity by the Hanly report. Let us look at what has been happening in recent times where centralised controllers and administrators have taken decisions — it is appalling. Let us look at some of those decisions for an instant. The decisions taken by clinicians or administrators in the hospitals in Monaghan and Cavan had serious consequences. If a health board or one of its members had made a proposal that had such consequences, there would have been a hue and cry.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">In another example, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the authorities at Peamount Hospital refused admission to a patient suffering from a highly infectious complaint requiring isolation and specialised treatment that was available in the hospital. Why was that? The administrators, the bureaucrats, those given the job of providing a service, and not merely providing a service in the way in which they thought it should be done, turned the patient away, thereby presenting a serious threat not only to the patient but to those other patients who were then expected to have this person alongside them in other hospitals. What was the response from the authorities? They said that such cases in future would be treated in other general hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I spent a number of years on a health board, entertained by the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, much as I entertained him.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">We did. If a similar decision had been taken at that time there would have been a hue and cry and a special meeting would have been arranged where the people responsible would have been called to account. What happens now? Nothing, and it is intended that nothing happens. If the Hanly report is implemented, although half of the Government says it should be while the other half says it would not be a good idea in the run-up to the local and European elections, there will be totally centralised control and no possibility of democracy prevailing in future.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_484">Until recently there were local area health advisory committees. Those bodies met in each community care area and vetted the performance of the health services on a month by month basis. The head of each discipline would give an account of his or her stewardship and all involved would comment. Representatives of the local authorities, nursing organisations and the medical profession were involved and when a proposal was made at a meeting that might have an impact on the delivery and quality of services, it would be discussed. There was no such thing as a person making a decision that would affect the quality of services or those working in them without a debate. Now, however, there is a new era in health politics where centralised control eliminates as much debate as possible and information is withheld for as long as possible from as many as possible, ensuring the Minister does not have to answer questions in this House. Local authority or health board members do not have the opportunity to ask questions, the entire operation is as secretive as possible and the services are run in a way not seen before.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">I remember being on a health board in the early days and debating centralised control. The thinking then within the Department was that big institutions were the answer to everyone's prayers and the bigger the hospital, the better it would be. That was all rubbish because the degree to which specialised areas were able to operate and link with other hospitals made or broke the service.</p>

Since the Fitzgerald report was published in the early 1970s there has been no focus on where the health services are going at all. This proposal would result in even less focus in future and that is a sad thing because I thought Deputy Callely was a focused Minister of State. The reason there is no focus is that everything now revolves around the money available and the extent to which a service can be provided to meet a need.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_258" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_530">It is soul destroying to come here tonight to talk about the abuse of taxpayers' money by this Government. The real tragedy is that those wasted billions of euros could have done so much for people whom we have an obligation to help, whose need is urgent, and who are suffering severe deprivation. The shame for that belongs to those responsible — our Government, which has officiated over the squandering of those scarce resources. The fiasco of Abbotstown cost €199.8 million. The cost of Luas has gone from some €466 million in 1999 to €764 million in 2001 and €775 million in 2002. The Government could give €15 million to Punchestown while denying our worthy and forgotten emigrants the same amount, as recommended by its own report from the task force on emigrants, but that is not all. There are 48,000 households on our growing housing waiting list while the Government wastes €52 million on electronic voting and €12 million on an asylum centre which is no longer needed in leafy Donnybrook.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">All the while people lie on trolleys because there are no hospital beds. People cannot afford to get sick, since they cannot get access to a GP because they do not have medical cards. There are brand-new medical units which cannot open because of lack of funding, while private hospitals get large tax breaks. People are dying because of health cuts — so say the medical consultants — and cancer patients are not receiving optimum treatment. A thousand people wait for six years to get an appointment, and one will be seen in a few weeks if one has cancer. Arthritics wait for four years for a first rheumatology appointment with the sole rheumatologist in the west. He attended the Joint Committee on Health and Children a year ago, and nothing has changed since. He is looking after the entire Western Health Board area and additional counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">We need proper investment in our ground ambulances and ambulance stations, but we also need a helicopter emergency medical service. The Beaumont story of 2000 showed us the farce that has been provided by the Aer Corps. They call it an air ambulance service, but people desperately ill wait for 12.25 hours for the Aer Corps helicopter to turn up. It is not a dedicated service, so it is no fault of the Aer Corps. The fault lies with the Government. The Aer Corps spends more time carrying Ministers from A to B than on mercy missions, and it is based in Dublin. Some helicopters are not available when they are wanted. My patient lay on the ground and is now paralysed for life in a wheelchair because of the failure of the Aer Corps to turn up owing to lack of availability.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">We need a dedicated helicopter service to deal with the 400 to 600 transfer cases that must be catered for every year. In 1997 the Aer Corps made just over 200 transfers, and in 2001 the figure was 86. That was certainly not enough. The answer lies in the recently published feasibility study report into an all-Ireland helicopter emergency medical service. That report was two years overdue. The cost of such a service is €12 million plus an annual charge of €4 million. That includes the cost of building the helipad at Beaumont Hospital. Surely the Government should agree to that as an urgent priority as do our ground ambulance workers and emergency medical technicians. A baby with meningitis cannot wait 12.25 hours. The Government indicated the need for six new Aer Corps helicopters five months ago to mind President Bush at Shannon and Dromoland. The tenders are now being issued. Why not give the go-ahead for HEMS? It gave a dedicated helicopter to the Garda to fight crime, so why not look after people who are desperately ill and need this service?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_259">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_534">I am thankful for the opportunity to present this motion with my Independent colleagues in Dáil Éireann. Before I enter the details of the debate, perhaps I might put to bed the notion that there is no real opposition to Government policies in this House. This motion clearly shows we have a group of Deputies prepared to stand up and be counted when dealing with real issues affecting our people. Those issues are the key policy areas on which we were elected, and we intend standing up for them in this debate. I urge all Deputies in this House to support us and, above all, support the important needs of our citizens. The issues are the squandering of public money, the rich-poor gap in Ireland, the needs of our health service, the delay in the publication of the disability Bill, the housing waiting list, educational disadvantage, the care of the elderly, and the urgent need for a just society based on equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">In our motion, we raised the issue of the disability Bill. Perhaps I might bury some of the negative comments made over the past 24 hours regarding that legislation, particularly those coming from the Government side. People from the disabled community want rights-based legislation because they have been let down by successive Governments and left at the back of the queue for services and a better quality of life. It is necessary for people to trust new legislation. That is the key. They must be confident that it will take their genuine needs into account. Therefore they must be sure that Governments, now and in the future, are obliged by legislation to do this. There is an awareness that the Government and in particular the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform fear rights-based legislation because they believe it will have the effect of opening the financial floodgates, but I reject this. We do not agree that rights-based legislation would have this effect. However, it is time for people to listen to the disability groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">As regards costs we have the scandal of hundreds of thousands in taxpayers' money being spent every second week on legal cases against families that have children and adults with disabilities. On the broader issue of housing, there are 48,000 households on waiting lists. The national housing needs assessment compiled by local authorities completely underestimates the number of people with disabilities in need of housing. Only 423 were assessed. Local authorities have to respond. We need to build more houses. The disabled person's grant is now at a maximum of €20,000, and many people get less than that. There are 120,000 people with disabilities dependent on social welfare payments, which are insufficient to get a loan or mortgage. Will the Minister say how they can do this? People with a mental illness are still stuck in hospitals and locked away. This is not an option. So what do we do? We build more houses. We look at examples of good practice. The whole question of funding needs to be looked at and we have presented ideas of economic reaction to the housing crisis in our motion tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Other strategies are required. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government needs to get its act together with the Department of Health and Children and they should work together on a national accommodation plan for housing people with disabilities. The disabled person's grant should cover 100% of the cost of the approved building work. That is the way forward. Local authorities have to work with voluntary and State agencies. We need an action plan, not more talk or more reports. We need a dedicated actions officer in local authorities. This would make a major contribution for all people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The Disability Federation of Ireland needs to be a recognised body at county and city level to facilitate the disabilities sector in local government. In accordance with section 48 of the Local Government Act 2001, the requirement to ensure the disabilities sector is represented on strategic policy committees is the way forward. The Minister should look at section 48. There are too many people on the fringes of our communities. There are too many people being neglected. I urge all Deputies to support our motion, support people with disabilities, our health service, reform and investment, people on housing waiting lists and, above all, the sensible spending of public money on worthwhile projects.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_260">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_539">I would like to speak on two parts of tonight's motion. One is in regard to the cost of tribunals. The cost of tribunals mirrors the cost of legal services in this country. I look forward to the time when the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, will publish the reports on competitiveness in the legal system, because so much money is being spent in legal fees covering all aspects of Government business. Tribunal costs in particular look scandalous in the eyes of the public. We throw out figures here such as €100 million. Only recently we witnessed the case of an <i>au pair</i> who had a difference with her employer and who took the issue to the High Court. That will cost her €300,000 in legal fees or more. It will probably take her a lifetime to pay it off. I am surprised the Government has not tackled the anti-competitive nature of legal costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, takes every opportunity to have a snipe or a go at what general practitioners earn. A GP would need to see 100 private patients in a day to earn the fees of one of the senior counsels at the tribunals. The same GP would need to look after more than 5,000 patients to earn the fees of junior barristers in the tribunals. That figure of 5,000 people is equivalent to the population of a big town. This is something to be urgently tackled by the Government rather than simply having a go at other professions in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">As regards the health service, which again is included in tonight's motion, naturally there is a crisis because of the state it is in. There is poor access to services for those who need them. In some health boards services are non-existent. For some services such as neurology, it might as well be non-existent it takes people so long to get access. Patients wait three and four years to be seen by an ear, nose and throat consultant or for an out-patient's orthopaedic appointment. That is simply unacceptable in this day and age. Time prevents me from expanding on these issues, but I am sure the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, well understands the position from the crisis in accident and emergency departments caused by a bottleneck in bed availability in hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The reason for the crisis is that there is little or no management of beds in the acute hospital services. Beds are being closed. Patients who should be in other facilities are not being moved on because of the warped thinking which concludes it is easier to pay €2,500 for them to be looked after in an acute hospital rather than the €700 it would cost to care for them in a nursing home. The thinking is that if the bed is made available the €2,500 will have to be paid anyway. That is the sort of foolish thinking that is currently running the health services and it is causing many problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">Many other aspects of the motion will be debated by other members of the Independent group. Even if we do not have time to discuss them all, I hope the Government will take on board what we are saying. What is needed is more accountability and transparency.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_544">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion. It gives us an opportunity to look at the magnitude of mismanagement of the finances of our country on an ongoing basis. Not having money is one thing, having it and squandering it is another. Some time ago, anyone who had to borrow money was aware of how much every citizen owed. We were told everyone owed £2,000 or £3,000 or whatever it was. I wonder if any thought has been given to finding out how much has been squandered on our behalf. It appears that more and more hundreds of millions are being squandered daily. We are harking back to the days of the Celtic tiger, when the country was awash with funds. Perhaps Ministers feel they are immune from having to answer for such spending, that there is plenty of money there so we should move on. I am often asked what makes a Minister of this Government different from an ordinary man in the street.</p>

Given the approaching problem of climate change and the significant reduction we must make in our carbon dioxide emissions, research projects would be the best use of that sum. It is not a large amount in the context of overall Government spending, but if the Minister spent €52 million on biomass, biofuse, wind, wave or tidal power technology to make Ireland a world expert in one of those areas rather than always lagging behind, that would have been a much better use of the money he squandered. It would be useful if the Minister started learning from those lessons. If the word "arrogant" arises frequently in the context of the Minister's actions he might pause to wonder why.</p>

According to the first edition of Sky News Ireland, it is only now, after seven years in office, that the Government is willing to rectify that by putting fixed contract costs in place. This Government also forgoes tax receipts by its tax expenditure and the money it gives away in the form of allowances. This benefits the wealthy, distorts their tax payments and places the burden of tax payments for maintaining public services on the middle and low income earners.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">That will be the legacy of the Government. Not only is it reckless and greedy, it has failed to take the opportunity of the world economic environment to make this a better off country which, although it feels less at ease with itself, has begun to come to terms with its contradictions, such as the imbalance between rich and poor and between those who have all they need and those who cannot access basic services.</p>

Most working people have not benefited to near the extent they should from the economic growth which they brought about. They have not benefited in financial terms in an economy where we still have a serious problem with low pay, especially in the service sector. They have certainly not benefited in terms of quality of life at a time when people are working longer hours, spending less time with their families and devoting less energy to recreational pursuits and voluntary work in their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Above all, people are not benefiting in terms of improved public services in health, education, public transport and physical infrastructure. When these issues are raised, the Taoiseach and Ministers immediately pull out the departmental script and provide lists of raw spending figures. They choose to ignore the other end of the equation, the actual delivery or non-delivery of services, the inequity which permeates the system, the dire needs which are neglected and the marginalised people who are kept on the margins.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">At the root of the Government's mismanagement of the economy is not just incompetence, although there is plenty of that, but a fundamentally flawed view of the role and function of the economy. The Government's philosophy is to look after the market in the mistaken view that the market will look after people's needs. This is epitomised in its disastrous housing policy, which has been alluded to by previous speakers, that has pushed the cost of homes even beyond the reach of people on average incomes. It has made millionaires and billionaires of property speculators and developers, the friends of Fianna Fáil, and turned every acre of land zoned for housing into a gold mine. It has forced people into mortgage slavery so that now, as never before, people work ever longer hours to pay off loans to banks and building societies, so that these institutions and the developers and speculators can enjoy bloated profits. It is likely that people will face more difficult times if the interest rate forecast is correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The people slaving to pay mortgages are the lucky ones. The less fortunate are the 130,000 people — 48,000 housing units — awaiting social housing from local authorities. As a proportion of overall housing output, we have the lowest level of social housing in the history of the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">Since my election to the House in 1997, I have never ceased to challenge the two-tier health system. That fundamentally unequal system is at the root of the many and complex problems plaguing our health services. It is both grossly inequitable and grossly inefficient. There is no need to recite again all the Government's broken promises on health. However, I will return to the promise on waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">Nobody has been fooled by the statistical exercise by the Minister for Health and Children designed to disguise the true level of hospital waiting lists. I tabled a parliamentary question to him today inquiring if there were estimates of the number of patients awaiting appointments with hospital consultants, in other words, those who are on a waiting list to get on a hospital waiting list. These are people referred to consultants by their GPs in the expectation that they will almost certainly require surgery. In his reply, the Minister stated the Department does not collect or collate such information and has no intention of doing so. The hidden waiting list will remain hidden, most conveniently for a Government that promised to permanently end hospital waiting lists by this month.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">I remind the Government of another parliamentary question I asked of the Minister for Finance regarding the cost to the Exchequer of the range of massive tax breaks to hoteliers, developers of holiday homes, multi-storey car parks and sports injury clinics, to name but a few. The Minister was unable to quantify the cost. The people's money is being given away in these and many other tax breaks and the Minister cannot even tell us what it is costing.</p>

However, more should be expected from the other parties which support this motion. Glib and facile comments to the effect that the economy is working but the Government is not simply do not wash. Every year for seven years we have heard the Opposition doing its Chicken Licken impersonation telling us that the sky is about to fall in. It has opposed tax reductions. It has said we were spending too much and at the same time that we are spending too little.</p>

          <p eId="para_711">This is something which the Opposition likes to dismiss and to point to other measures. Its approach to this is interesting because it involves dismissing its own so-called policies. The poverty targets we have worked to meet were set out not by us but by the Labour-Fine Gael Government in 1996. It was the then leader of the Democratic Left who was in charge of the process of defining the targets. We signed up to the targets in Opposition and worked to them in Government. We achieved them a couple of years before the target dates set by the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">As defined by the Opposition in Government, poverty has fallen and the ability of people to participate in society has improved.

          <p eId="para_720">I know it is painful, but the Deputies must listen. As regards social welfare payments, I remind them of the facts. At a time when the unemployment rate has more than halved, social welfare spending has almost doubled since 1997. The majority of this additional funding has gone to increase the rates of social welfare payments. For example, the lowest weekly social welfare rate was approximately €83 in 1997 compared with more than €134 per week today. The money to fund these record increases is available because of a balanced economic policy which recognises that one must generate resources before one can spend them.</p>

          <p eId="para_727">The motion tabled by the Technical Group does not provide that honesty. It typically tries to have the best of both worlds. It fails to demonstrate how additional health spending, more new housing starts and the provision of extra community employment places will be paid for. There is no more than a vague reference to equitable taxation in the motion. What exactly does this mean? Does it mean increasing personal taxation and, if so, at what level and at what rate? Does it mean increasing business taxes and, if so, which taxes? Is it proposed to abandon the policies which have served us so well during the past seven years?</p>
          <p eId="para_728">These are serious and legitimate questions which require honest answers. Ireland has created a thriving enterprise culture where the creation and maintenance of work is encouraged and facilitated. We have all worked hard to create that climate, it is the legacy of the Celtic tiger and one which we are duty-bound to foster and protect.

In budget 2004, a €10 per week increase was provided in the rate of the lowest social welfare payments. This is more than 3.5 times the projected rate of inflation in 2004. An estimated 970,000 people on average are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments this year and almost 1.5 million people, including dependants — or two out of every five people in the State — will benefit from these payments.</p>

          <p eId="para_773">The Government understands that the provision of housing at affordable prices continues to be one of the major concerns of young working people and their parents. The success of our economic policies in creating almost three quarters of a million extra jobs since 1990 has put unprecedented demands on the Irish housing market. The approach of the Government has been to tackle this issue with a wide range of initiatives. In particular, we recognise that housing supply is the key to holding down house prices and helping people to become homeowners. This approach is clearly working. We are now building almost 70,000 houses per annum in Ireland — three times the levels of ten years ago, three times the output per head of population of the EU average and five times the UK output.</p>

          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_836">I propose to share my time with Deputy Bernard Durkan. The Minister is leaving which, perhaps, is timely because I was about to refer to some of his remarks. It strikes me that the Government is so high on its own arrogance that it has lost touch with what is happening in the real world. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, is one of the few Ministers who still has his feet on the ground, and Ministers like him must surely know that the product of rampant false promises made before the last election is to be seen now in the cruel cutbacks in areas for which he is responsible. We are scraping the barrel to try to keep home help services going. Elderly people in need of care are being squeezed for the scarce hour a week or hour a day home help to try to accommodate someone else. Where does that fit into the great Christian democratic ideal which was praised by Deputy Conor Lenihan, who did not stay to hear the rest of the debate? The Government is driven by electoral need. That is the one thing the Government understands.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">It is timely that the Technical Group has brought up this huge array of white elephants that has emerged from the stable opposite during recent years. Even this week, in trying to provide for the European Union Presidency when there will be 30 meetings and Ministers will tramp up and down the streets of the country trying to show Ireland and themselves in a good light to their ministerial colleagues, they failed to observe any of the procedures that were put in place to deal with public procurement. This is a gross failing and it comes right from the heart of the Department of Finance and the Progressive Democrats Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who ought to ensure that we use money responsibly.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">There is something seriously awry — and the rhetoric of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage  and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, does not address it — when in regard to the Punchestown equine centre we saw no tenders or evaluation and decisions by Ministers made without any proper procedure to double the money within seven days when the original Estimate was not enough. That is not how we expect financial management to be done. This is Ministers treating taxpayers' money as if it was their own to be used on a whim to try to curry favour with small groups within their constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">It is interesting that Deputy Conor Lenihan referred to Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae. The high point of Fianna Fáil cynicism regarding public spending must surely have come with the marina in Kenmare. Not only were all procedures ignored but the Department of the Taoiseach wrote letters to be signed by another Minster to override all need for evaluation. That happened under the eyes of the Government which has the audacity to tell the people the key issues for it in the next election will be accountability and value for money. That marina was demolished because it did not have planning permission. The Taoiseach signed off on that without proper procedure and taxpayers' money not only went down the drain but ended up as rubble.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">We have seen that sort of approach also regarding Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland, another castle in the sky that the Taoiseach wanted to build for himself. The consequence of his arrogance on that issue is that we now have no stadium, the opportunity for the FAI to produce a stadium has been scuppered and we have stalled the opening of Croke Park to other sports. Again we have seen the familiar pattern of a Government unwilling to use public money according to a certain code and to insist on proper procedures and evaluation, and unwilling to accept that it is acting on trust for the people and that it is supposed to defend their interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Time and again we see the opposite occurring. It is no accident that there are vacant asylum facilities, vacant hospitals in Mullingar and vacant units in Blanchardstown acquired by the Government at great expense. That is the consequence of not putting proper financial procedures in place and of not anticipating what happens when certain decisions are made. When a decision is made to build a hospital, it must be staffed. If the Government does not think that far down the road, it is not fit to govern.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">If it is decided to extend medical cards to people who are 70 years of age and over, one must have an accurate assessment of how many people will be involved, negotiate with doctors and assess the consequences of extending free treatment to all those over 70 years of age. None of that was done and, as a consequence, the taxpayer has paid ten times more than the Minister estimated for that concession.</p>

          <from>Mr. Callely</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_506">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_844">If the Minister of State wants to check that, he should read the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the subject. It came in as an Estimate of €5 million and ended up as an Estimate of €50 million. The same is true of other "goodies" that have been brought in by Ministers trying to sweeten the pill at budget time. We have reached the stage where the budget is a charade. In the hands of the Government, it has become a vehicle for short-term opportunism.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">The greatest rabbit produced out of the hat this year was when decentralisation was announced to screen a budget that was otherwise siphoning money out of people's pockets through stealth taxes. That was covered up by producing the idea of decentralisation like a rabbit out of a hat. With decentralisation everyone would have a slice of Government coming to their town soon. It was a cynical move.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">We need regional reform to drive regional development. The way to do that is within the context of the spatial plan with a well-planned policy that anticipates what will happen to the quality of service and plans for that, and where there are talks with staff to ensure that they can make this change efficiently. None of that was done. Electoral needs drove everything. Any sensible analysis or assessments were rejected. It became a short-term political spree over which Government and Ministers scrambled like so many hyenas over a carcass. That is not the way to treat the public service which has been a valued asset to this country. It deserves to be treated with the seriousness it has earned over many years. It is lamentable to see Ministers coming here to try to defend decentralisation when none of them thought about how they would make it work or how it would deliver improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">Unfortunately, we have blown a massive opportunity to do good. When I was Fine Gael's education spokesman a few years ago, the key issue we faced was ensuring that more people stay in school. We needed to find ways of stopping people from dropping out of school early, without qualifications. After six years of the greatest bonanza this country has seen, it is pathetic that the same number of children continue to drop out of school without literacy abilities of the standard we need. It is still the case that one in six children leaves school without being able to understand the instructions on the side of an aspirin packet. Such a fact is at odds with the great Christian democratic ideal that Deputy Conor Lenihan said was being delivered on by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">We see discrimination every day. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, meets many people in private rented accommodation, just as I do. Many such people are badly paid but are trying to better themselves. What support do they get from the State to support them in trying to meet the cost of their rent? The sum total of what the Government will concede to them is €4.99, despite the fact that the Celtic tiger was built on their backs. It is unfair treatment. If they were unemployed and in receipt of rent supplement, they would be given €200 per week. If they were living in a local authority house on a differential rent, they would get €200 per week. They would also receive substantial support if they were getting a mortgage. The Government treats people with contempt and discrimination, however. They cannot get any of those things because they are in the private rented sector. Government Members are too blind to see what is happening under their eyes.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">It makes me sad that Ministers come to the House to pretend that everything is rosy in the garden when there are problems everywhere. It is time for a radical Cabinet reshuffle, at least so that people who understand what it is to struggle and to try to get by can be introduced from the backbenches of Fianna Fáil. The current Cabinet has grown increasingly out of touch. The Progressive Democrats Members have become more like Fianna Fáil Members as time has gone by. There is no distinction between the parties. A prominent Progressive Democrats Deputy climbed up poles to say "One-Party Government — No Thanks", but it was just a slick trick to get to the top of the greasy pole, as Benjamin Disraeli described it when he became Prime Minister in the UK. The Progressive Democrats continue to be driven by such motives — they are not driven by a need for reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The House must address the issue of serious reform. We are a joke as a House. We are not holding the Government to account to a sufficient extent as we do not have the powers, resources or parliamentary means of doing so. It is time for the Government's procedures to change so that those who sponsored the over-70s medical card, for example, will have to come to the House to be held responsible. The Minister who introduced the system should take the rap for the fact that it is ten times over budget. Like any other chief executive who gets it wrong, he should sacrifice his position. We need such accountability. If that is what the Taoiseach means by accountability, it would be a great thing, but it is not what he means. His focus groups have come up with the idea that he is seen as indecisive, that he does not sufficiently derive value for money and that he is not sufficiently accountable. He has tried to address such problems by producing language to suggest that this is what he is all about. Such a ploy is skin deep and will not con the people anymore.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_507">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_851">This timely motion encompasses many of the things we have been saying in the House since the last general election, although it would take a much longer motion to encompass fully all the failures of the present Administration. The motion refers to the various overruns in almost every Department. The cost overruns in the Government's procurements, sales and contracts are of such serious magnitude that we are prompted to ask what is really happening. What is happening in respect of the various public contracts that makes them not seem to add up? Every other country in the world seems to have a system that can be measured fairly accurately when it comes to public procurement and contracts, but it seems to go on and on forever here. An overrun of €50 million, €60 million or €100 million is relatively nothing here. The clear impression has been given that the Government does not care. It is sad.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">The neck of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, who addressed the House tonight, is in a very healthy condition. He must have a very healthy neck to allow him to come to the House after wasting €52 million of taxpayers' money. The money went down the tubes as he attempted to pursue his dream and that of his predecessor. In theory, the dream was pursued so that the voting system could be modernised. Having tried everything else, the Government has decided to turn its hand to modernising democracy. What worries me most about the Minister is that he is totally impervious to criticism. He believes he is doing the right thing. He defiantly said to the House tonight: "Wait until you see; this system is going to be in whether you like it or not." That is a rather peculiar thing to say. It is the first time I have heard something like it in this House. The Minister's negligence and bad management have resulted in the loss of almost €60 million of taxpayers' money. Not only has he forgotten to say sorry, but he has refused to accept that he was wrong. It is a serious problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">Another serious problem is starting to affect those on the Government benches, both Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats. Poor Deputy Conor Lenihan was showing signs of delirium this evening. He considers that the Government's loss of €52 million on the electronic voting project represents the achievement of a great objective. He thinks that it was a major achievement. He cited as a shining example the monument to Deputy Healy-Rae, which was constructed without planning permission. The fact that the monument is not near water is a problem, when one considers that it is a marina. It took a fair amount of imagination for a Deputy of some years' standing to suggest that it was a great idea and a major achievement. It is sad that such an attitude was expressed in the House tonight in support of the unsupportable.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">Deputy Richard Bruton referred to the Tarzan-like feats that were performed by certain members of the Progressive Democrats on top of telegraph poles in the centre of the city. The Progressive Democrats set themselves up as watchdogs in government which, in turn, indicates that there was a need for watchdogs. Having laid down with the enemy, however, the Progressive Democrats are quite happy to sup at the same table and to walk away contentedly. There is not a single word of demur from them at present and there will not be, because they are happy to be buried in the bosom of Fianna Fáil and smothered within a Government that is engaging in a spending splurge that has continued, with one or two exceptions, since the Government came into office.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">Deputy Conor Lenihan also mentioned the Government's great achievement in cutting taxes, but it is obvious that he forgot to mention that it has also cut services. The two matters are linked. The real cuts have taken place in the major areas of housing, health, education and crime prevention. Everybody is affected by these cuts. The Government believes it does not have the wherewithal to win another election if it does not save money at the public's expense to create a war chest over the next two and a half years. It hopes that such a fund will allow it to cod the public into giving it support that it does not deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">In days gone by, Ministers would put their hands up and say, "We got it wrong, I am sorry, we shouldn't have done that," before quietly walking away. The current Government is involved in a different ball game. These guys are actually proud of their performance and they keep repeating it again and again. Every time somebody on the Opposition side points out the Government's inadequacies, the Government Members bluster and tell us about all the good they have done. However, that is no more than the spending splurge in which they have indulged to endear them to the public, they hope, when the next general election comes. They are currently worried. They are putting before the people their candidates for the European and local elections.</p>

            <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_860">Events have developed during the day, and AIB has indicated that one of its staff has been temporarily suspended from duties while matters are investigated. The handling of this business has exposed a deep problem in the bank. There has been a clear lack of understanding within AIB of the obligations of consumer law. There were no proper compliance procedures to ensure the bank stayed within the law, and even people at senior level, heads of departments, seemed to be unaware of their obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">While there are red faces in the AIB Bankcentre, the Government too should have some red faces regarding this issue. The discovery of the offence came from a whistle blower not from effective regulation. It also revealed in very stark terms there is no sanction in the legislation for the offence of charging more than was allowed by the authorities. The Government cannot apply any sanction in the matter. There has been no monitoring of the bank's obligation. Over a period of eight years, even the new financial service regulators, supposedly the most up-to-date in the area of regulation, did not identify this breach of one of the most basic elements of consumer law.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">The Government has not put in place any legal obligation on the directors of the banks to have a compliance statement. Currently, the directors of almost all major companies must produce compliance statements on health and safety issues and on an entire range of matters. In financial institutions, a compliance statement regarding observation of consumer law is not required by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">These huge gaps have appeared not by accident, but because of the regulatory structure that we have as a direct result of a turf war in which the consumer lost out. When this legislation was going through the Dáil, I demanded, by means of a reasoned amendment, a delay on this Act until we had a full audit of the consumer protection powers we were giving to IFSRA. The Minister refused to have such an audit and now, at the very first challenge to this new regulatory authority, we discover that there are no sanctions to protect the consumer in respect of this issue. That is a serious flaw, and one for which the two Ministers involved, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, must take the rap. There has been heavy spinning by Government, in the hope that AIB would take all the flak, but the Government must face up to its responsibilities in the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">This affair has also revealed deeper problems in the banking sector. The sector is not competitive when it comes to small businesses and personal borrowers. We have seen this time and again. The euro rate cuts were not passed on to small businesses or to personal borrowers. Savers are being mis-sold products which are not of a proper standard. Elderly people are being sold long-life products. We need to address much more vigorously the issue of regulation and competition in the banking sector. The Government has received two reports from the Competition Authority, yet nothing has been done.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">We need Government action. At the very least, sanctions must first be put in place for the type of offence revealed. New regulations must be enforced to facilitate the smooth moving by consumers of their business from one banking institution to another. We must restrict captive selling, which we have seen as part of the problem in the sale of investment products to elderly people. We must subject the bank clearance system to proper, fair access rules. We need to have bank advisers subject to the same professional requirements which apply to all other investment advisers. Those working for the bank should have to prepare a statement of advice and be able to show that such advice is appropriate to the needs of the person. We need to institute cooling-off periods for investors. Numerous amendments must be put in place to protect consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">Sadly, this Government has not even started on that radical agenda. I hope that if anything positive emerges from this debacle, it will be that the Government is alerted to the substantial issues that need to be addressed in this area.</p>

          <speech by="#IvorCallely" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_511">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
            <p eId="para_867">I thank my constituency colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, for raising this very important issue and giving me the opportunity to respond.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">This in some ways is a first test of the regulatory structure put in place last year. That structure, which was set out in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003, brought together into one institution, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, financial regulatory functions that hitherto had been spread over four different institutions. Among the responsibilities transferred to IFSRA were the functions which formerly rested with the Director of Consumer Affairs under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. This Act did not make it an offence to fail to notify correct amounts to the director.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">IFSRA is carrying out a serious and detailed investigation and we should not prejudge all the facts until that investigation is completed. A team of senior inspectors has already advanced its work and as a result, IFSRA has established that it should be possible to identify from records at least two thirds of the people who have been affected by incorrect charges. IFSRA has also requested AIB to report immediately on the extent of the impact on its customers, to examine how compensation can be appropriately paid, to identify how the matters could have arisen and persisted over an extended period, and to identify remedial measures to ensure that such matters could not arise again.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">Naturally, the focus of the IFSRA investigation is initially concentrated on identifying the amount involved and the customers affected. The next phase of the investigation will involve finding out how this could have arisen in the first place and persisted over an eight-year period, and identifying whatever measures need to be taken to address this issue. IFSRA has also agreed with AIB that a €25 million deposit will be made with the Central Bank to cover anticipated costs of reimbursing customers, including interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">Regarding ongoing official policing of the 1995 Act provisions. I understand there is a spot-checking system in place and that the majority of these spot checks have concentrated on foreign currency cash transactions.</p>

            <from>Mr. Callely</from>
            <p eId="para_873">These account for the vast majority of foreign exchange transactions carried out by consumers. Random checks do not pick up everything, and I understand IFSRA will consider any changes to the regulatory procedure required following its investigation in the current case. The chief executive of IFSRA said today: "This case, I believe, clearly demonstrates that we do have powers and we are willing and able to use them on behalf of the consumer." However, he has noted a desire that IFSRA would have additional powers to levy penalties or sanctions in appropriate cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">As the House will be aware a second Bill, to complement the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003, has completed Second and Committee Stages in this House, and Report Stage will be taken shortly. This Bill complements the Act passed last year and deals with a wide range of issues. In particular it includes provision for penalties to be applied to financial institutions which contravene a provision of financial services legislation, contravene an IFSRA code of conduct and contravene a direction from IFSRA or a condition or requirement imposed on the institution by IFSRA under financial services legislation. It should be noted that IFSRA may amend its codes of conduct when necessary to keep abreast of the current state of development of financial markets and financial products.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">In addition to the penalties provisions, the Bill provides for significant additional powers for IFSRA to require formal statements from institutions in regard to their compliance with legislation — compliance statements — on which IFSRA may also require sign-off by auditors. This provision will be in addition to provisions of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 which will impose an obligation on the directors of companies to prepare and publish a directors' compliance statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">To sum up, the Government has sponsored legislation to establish IFSRA, which is already proactively managing the situation that has arisen in AIB. It has, through the legislation, very considerably extended the consumer protection and education functions of IFSRA and has allowed IFSRA the resources to carry out these functions. I agree with Deputy Richard Bruton that further legislation is required. This was signalled during the passage of the 2003 Act. This additional legislation is well advanced in the form of a Bill due to go to Report Stage in this House. We should await the results of IFSRA's detailed investigation before drawing final conclusions on the case. We must all, Government, Oireachtas regulators and financial institutions, learn the lessons that will emerge from this case, to provide greater safety and reassurance to the financial services consumers of this country. The Government is determined to do its part.</p>

          <heading>Residential Institutions Redress Scheme.</heading>
          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_514">
            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_877">I welcome the opportunity to raise the operation of the Residential Institutions Redress Board. Today is the fifth anniversary of the apology by the Taoiseach to the Irish people, to people who were abused in institutions while in the care of the State. At that time a great sense of hope existed that the issues would finally be acknowledged and addressed, giving the survivors the opportunity to tell their story. Measures to compensate the survivors for what happened during their childhood, although it would never be at the level required to compensate for their childhood, were put in place. Five years later, many stories remain to be told and there has been little in the way of either justice, redress, transparency or closure for many of the victims of abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">Practically every Member spoke last week to Mr. Tom Sweeney when he was on hunger strike outside the Dáil. I am aware that Deputy Sherlock as well as many other colleagues spoke to him every day during his four week hunger strike. I wish to ensure, now the crisis is over, that we do not forget the issues that were raised by Mr. Sweeney and the other survivors of child abuse who were with him on his hunger strike. We are all relieved that he was able to accept the proposal put to him and I understand he is making a good recovery. On each occasion on which I spoke to Mr. Sweeney, he stressed that his action was not as a result of the lower award but to highlight the operation of the redress board, which he said punished survivors who wanted the opportunity to have their experience outlined in a full hearing of the board. That was certainly his perception and that of many others to whom I spoke in the past few weeks. He and a number of others had their awards substantially reduced at hearing.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">There is certainly a perception that this is a deliberate strategy to deter survivors from going to hearing and if this is the case, it must be stopped. Let me stress that it is a perception, but this perception must be addressed, particularly in light of the fact that a man was willing to risk his life to have the issue addressed. Another issue that has been raised about the board's operation is that the former Minister, Deputy Woods, gave an undertaking that awards would be commensurate with those of the High Court. Many have told me that this is not the practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">One of the problems is that the secrecy that surrounds the operation of the redress board means that it is very difficult to access the facts around these concerns and to know the reality for many people. In that context, I call on the Minister to review the operation of the board to ensure that it is complying with the spirit of the legislation as outlined to the Oireachtas when it was debated and when the regulations under the Act were discussed at the Committee on Education and Science. I participated in the committee debate, although I was not a spokesperson when the Bill was being debated in the House. During the debate, there was no indication in the replies we received from the Department representative in committee or from the Minister in the Chamber that going to hearing might lead to a reduction in the award. We were assured of the intention to mirror the level of award that an applicant could reasonably expect to receive in the High Court. That was spelled out in great detail with a weighting system which defined the level of abuse that was considered to have taken place and the level of damage that was considered to have been done and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">Mr. Sweeney felt so strongly about this issue that he was willing to put his life at risk. We as representatives of the public and the Minister for Education and Science, as the responsible Minister, must examine the issues he raised. If the legislation or the operation of the board is found wanting, changes must be made. However, I stress that I am requesting the Minister to undertake this review to ensure that no faults exist in the legislation or in the operation of the redress board. Anyone who spoke to those outside the Dáil last week know that they had genuinely felt concerns that must be addressed. In a sense the redress board is a step away from the Department of Education and Science and there is a difficulty in having the matters addressed, but the Minister must review the situation and come to a conclusion as to what, if anything, needs to be changed.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#IvorCallely" eId="spk_515" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. Callely</from>
            <p eId="para_882">I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for giving me the opportunity on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to speak on this matter and clarify the position on the operation of the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">I welcome Deputy O'Sullivan's acknowledgement of the Taoiseach's apology five years ago. It should be acknowledged that while many Taoisigh had the opportunity to address this issue, they failed to do so. The current Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, took the courageous step. He was concerned that victims of such abuse would have the opportunity of redress and that it should be as easy as possible. Deputy O'Sullivan noted the perception of reduced awards, and I would like to clarify that the redress board is not there to reduce the awards, but the opposite.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">I will address issues that should clarify the position to everybody's satisfaction, but most importantly the redress board and the review committee were set up to resolve issues rather than what is perceived. The Residential Institutions Redress Act was enacted on 10 April 2002. The Act provided for the establishment of the Residential Institutions Redress Board to provide a mechanism to make financial awards to victims of abuse to assist them in their recovery and enhance the quality of the remainder of their lives. It also provided an alternative to them having to pursue traumatic civil court cases to obtain compensation for injuries. While the civil courts operate on the basis that a plaintiff must prove his or her case on the balance of probability, the redress board operates on a much lower threshold of proof and does not make any finding of guilt in relation to an individual or an institution. An applicant can engage the services of a solicitor to assist him or her in submitting an application and all reasonable legal costs associated with it will be covered by the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">In 2002, the compensation advisory committee established by the then Minister for Education and Science produced a report, entitled Towards Redress and Recovery, which established a weighting scale for the evaluation of the severity of abuse and consequential injury. In addition to this, it set out redress bands for the offer of financial awards which are in line with High Court awards made in personal injuries cases. These scales have been incorporated into the regulations governing the operation of the board in assessing the amount of awards to be offered to applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">In some cases, the board will make an applicant a settlement offer solely based on the victim's written application. In the event an applicant is not satisfied with the offer, the person can opt to pursue an oral hearing of his or her case. If a person decides not to accept a settlement offer and proceeds to a hearing, that hearing takes place independently of the settlement talks. Members of the board who hear the case are not informed of any settlement process. In effect, this amounts to a new hearing of the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">Following the hearing, the board notifies the applicant in writing of the award on offer and the applicant has a period of one month to accept it. The applicant can use this period to reflect on the offer and consider any legal advice received from her or his legal representative on the merits of the award. The redress board has published information on its website today which indicates that 57% of cases which were sent to hearing after failure of the settlement process were increased, 29% had the awards reduced and 14% remained the same.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">In the event that an applicant is not satisfied with an award, the person is entitled under the Act to submit the application to the redress review committee, which will review the entire case. The review committee may uphold the amount of the award or increase or decrease the amount. The review committee stage of the process is, effectively, the final option available to an applicant under the redress Act process. However, an applicant still retains the right to pursue a case through the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">As the Deputy is aware, Mr. Sweeney, who had been on hunger strike outside Leinster House because he was dissatisfied with the outcome of the redress process, agreed to come off his strike last Thursday and has taken the option of recommencing his case in the courts. The Government has agreed to do everything it possibly can to expedite a hearing and, taking into account the papers already lodged for the purpose of his civil case, to agree that the case will proceed on the basis of an assessment of damages only.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">While Mr. Sweeney was dissatisfied with the outcome of his application to the redress board, the operation of the redress board and review committee must be viewed objectively and adverse judgments regarding the process should not be made on the basis of just one case. To date, in excess of 3,500 applications have been made to the redress board and awards have been offered in more than 1,000 of these cases. The remaining cases are at different stages of the redress process. This indicates a high level of satisfaction with the operation of the board and the process of redress.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">I am aware that some of the groups which represent survivors of abuse have requested a meeting with officials in the Department of Education and Science to discuss issues regarding the operation of the redress board, and this will be dealt with in the normal way. I also understand that officials from the redress board have met group leaders as well as hosting general meetings where issues raised by the leaders have been discussed and clarified. I am satisfied that this process will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">In the circumstances, the Department of Education and Science does not see a requirement to bring forward amendments to legislation which is working to the benefit of the majority of survivors. I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to explain the position in this House.</p>

        <speech by="#MarieHoctorFF" eId="spk_516">
          <from>Ms Hoctor</from>
          <p eId="para_893">Tá traidisiún na Gaeilge agus na teanga labhartha go láidir i dTiobraid Árann thuaidh. Tá Gaelscoil bhreá nua againn in Aonach Urmhumhan, mo bhaile féin, ach anocht, cuirim an bhéim ar Ghaelscoil Bhríde i nDurlas Éile.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">I am glad of the opportunity to raise this pressing issue regarding Gaelscoil Bhríde in Thurles. The school was founded in 1990 with six pupils. Current enrolment is 199 pupils. In September 2004, there will be 203 pupils, in September 2005, 211 pupils, and in September 2006, 217 pupils. These figures have been approved by the inspector.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Gaelscoil Bhríde is highly regarded in the town of Thurles. It provides co-educational facilities, is all-inclusive and serves the growing population of Thurles town, which is approximately 9,000, and the hinterland of Thurles. Currently, the school comprises six classrooms which are either at or below the minimum recommended space of 16 sq. ft. per pupil under the 1965 Department of Education and Science rules for national schools. There is no hard surface in the area in which the school is located, so it is not possible for children to play ball, which is a tremendous disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">The school has eight full-time teachers, one resource teacher, one learning support teacher and the príomh-oide. These are all catered for under one roof in an old building dating back 140 years. They work in accommodation kindly provided by a local family at a reasonable rent. This kind gesture of the landlord is indicative of the support in the community of Thurles. Nevertheless, the accommodation is inadequate for the growing numbers who wish to attend Gaelscoil Bhríde.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">Before 1999, a 3.9 acre site was bought by the Office of Public Works at Ardnacroise in Thurles for Gaelscoil Bhríde. Planning was applied for, but it was refused. It was also refused on appeal because of the poor entrance to this site. Architects were involved at the time and attempts to move on failed because of the poor entrance to this site at Ardnacroise. That site was, however, zoned educational. On 19 May 1999, the management of Gaelscoil Bhríde received a letter from the Department which consoled the parents and teachers. It stated that should there be any delay in the progress of the project because of technical difficulties outside the Department's control, the project would not lose its place in the priority listings.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">In December 2003, with the great assistance of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, a four acre site was bought by the OPW with his approval. Gaelscoil Bhríde hoped its plans for its growing school would move ahead. I was happy with this announcement because I had continued communication with the Minister and the board of management of the school. The application approved would have been for the eight classroom school and ancillary works for which the site at Ardnacroise was originally bought. A four acre site, however, has now been secured.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">To my knowledge, the schools building programme fails to list Gaelscoil Bhríde. This school is very pressed for space. A new site has been bought and there is no apparent plan in print at present despite the commitment given in the 19 May 1999 letter from the Department that should any difficulties arise, it would not lose its place on the building list. That is why I raise this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">My correspondence, together with that of the dedicated principal of the school, indicates clearly that Gaelscoil Bhríde is anxious to engage in public private partnership should the Minister approve it in his summer reappraisal of the building programme. I call on the Minister to sell the site which was deemed unsuitable and which is a property of the Department to fund the construction of a new school for Gaelscoil Bhríde. Tá foirgneamh nua ag teastáil ón nGaelscoil agus iarraim ar an Aire foirgneamh nua a thabhairt duinn gan mhoill. I ask the Minister to respond to this pressing need in Thurles. He has done so before with the purchase of the site and I ask him to move it along.</p>

        <speech by="#IvorCallely" eId="spk_517">
          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_901">I thank my colleague, Deputy Hoctor, who I know has a special interest in this case, for raising this matter on the Adjournment. It gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to outline to the House the departmental strategy for capital investment in education projects, as well as outlining the position regarding Gaelscoil Bhríde in Thurles.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">Gaelscoil Bhríde is a co-educational, all-Irish, primary school with a current enrolment of 199 pupils, a staffing of a principal plus eight mainstream teachers, one shared learning support and one resource teacher. The school opened in September 1990 with an enrolment of 25 pupils. The Department of Education and Science granted provisional recognition to the school in July 1991 and permanent recognition was granted in August 1993.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">The school operates in rented accommodation which is grant-aided by the Department at a rate of 95%. Enrolments at the school have continued to grow steadily since it opened. The need for permanent accommodation at the school is clearly acknowledged. The Department has already agreed that, on the basis of projected enrolments, permanent accommodation should be provided in the long term for an eight-classroom school. It was also agreed that a new building should be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">A design team was nominated for the proposed project in 1999 and for this project to progress to architectural planning, a suitable site had to be identified and purchased. The Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department of Education and Science in site acquisitions, was asked to investigate the availability and suitability of a number of sites in the locality of the school which might prove suitable for the construction of a new school.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">A number of sites were examined and a suitable site was finally identified in 2003. Final contracts for the sale were signed last September. The school site is now in the Department's ownership. The next stage will be the architectural planning and construction of the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">The 2004 school building programme at primary and post-primary levels amounts to €387 million. The programme will deliver 200 large-scale projects, but it was not possible to include all projects in this year's programme. The proposed project at Gaelscoil Bhríde is one of a number which must be considered in the context of future capital allocation for school building.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">When publishing the 2004 school building programme, the Department of Education and Science outlined that its strategy going forward would be grounded in capital investment based on multi-annual allocations. Officials from the Department are reviewing all projects which were not authorised to proceed as part of the 2004 school building programme with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005. The Department expects to be in a position to make further announcements on this matter in the course of the year. The proposed new school for Gaelscoil Bhríde will be considered in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">I thank Deputy Hoctor once again for having raised this matter in the House. I assure her that it will be brought to the attention of the departmental officials involved in the school building programme. The issue will be progressed as quickly as possible.</p>

          <heading>Post Mortem Facilities.</heading>
          <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_518">
            <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
            <p eId="para_909">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the provision of post mortem facilities nationally, seven days per week. In recent times, post mortem facilities have been withdrawn at weekends, first from the smaller general hospitals and now from the larger regional hospitals as well. Post mortems are needed at weekends in the case of sudden, unexplained deaths or murders. More often than not, such deaths occur as a result of car accidents or suicides, causing trauma in the homes of bereaved families.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">If, for example, someone dies as a result of an accident on a Friday evening, Saturday night or Sunday morning, the post mortem will be delayed. Some hospitals can undertake post mortems on Mondays, but some large hospitals cannot do them on the first working day after the weekend. Road accidents account for some 450 deaths annually, with quite a large proportion of them occurring at weekends. Young people are dying in these traumatic circumstances and, in addition, more than 450 suicides happen every year. Such deaths cause trauma for the bereaved families. If such deaths take place on bank holiday weekends, for example, the post mortem may be delayed for some days.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">Parents may be faced with taking the decision to switch off a life-support machine, which is a highly charged emotional situation for the next of kin. Such circumstances add to the trauma a family must suffer following the loss of a loved one. People find it difficult to accept that their relative is lying in hospital awaiting a post mortem. It may be part of our culture but people seem to prefer to keep the deceased at home, which can help with the grieving process.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">Young people dying unexpectedly in accidents will be grieved by their parents, brothers and sisters and, in some cases, they may have had children of their own. There is a sense of community grieving in cases involving sudden death, and so people wish to convey their sympathy when calling at the family home. They like to be able to see the body and it can help younger people to come to terms with their loss. Traditionally, wakes have been held in homes as a mark of respect to the deceased, and they can assist the grieving process. It is part of our culture which differs from that of our European neighbours. In some European countries, bodies are buried as soon as possible after death, while in others people think nothing of storing bodies in refrigerated facilities. Cultures vary, but we should respect and maintain ours which gives dignity to such sad occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">I never saw any decision being taken to withdraw post mortem facilities at weekends, yet, regrettably, it has happened. This is because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not making sufficient funding available for pathologists to be on-call at weekends. The fee for carrying out a post mortem at weekends is approximately €127, so it is a financial issue. Perhaps the authorities do not want post mortems to be carried out at weekends, but the matter should be examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">Normally, when a death occurs, the emergency is over. The exceptions include murder or an unexplained set of circumstances causing death. In such cases, evidence is preserved. Generally, suicides and fatal car crashes are not regarded as emergencies warranting post mortems at weekends, but compassion should be shown in such situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">The Minister for Health and Children should reinstate post mortem facilities at Monaghan General Hospital. The facilities were removed on health and safety grounds, and the same will happen in other hospitals. The Department's idea seems to be to transport bodies so that post mortems are undertaken at a different venue, but this can leave a family with the additional trauma of having to recuperate a body from another location.</p>
            <p eId="para_916">The inquest system has not been reviewed since the middle of the 19th century. Inquests should be dealt with in a swifter and more practical manner. These matters should be taken into consideration.</p>

            <from>Mr. Connolly</from>

            <from>Mr. Callely</from>
            <p eId="para_919">I understood the Deputy said that he was not so aware. I wish to respond positively to the Deputy's remarks, with the deepest compassion and understanding of the issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">When people are notified of the sudden death of a loved one, the circumstances are traumatic. It is painful for them to have to wait a number of days for a post mortem to be held so that the grieving process can begin in the fashion the Deputy has outlined.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">A post mortem is a procedure carried out to establish the cause of death in cases where the cause is not immediately certain. There are two categories of post mortem performed in this jurisdiction, a post mortem carried out under the Coroners Act 1962 and a post mortem carried out with the consent of the next of kin of a deceased at the request of an attending doctor.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">Post mortems are performed under the Coroners Act in circumstances of sudden, unexplained, violent and unnatural death where there is a legal responsibility on the doctor, registrar of deaths, funeral undertaker, householder and every person in charge of any institution in which the deceased person was residing at the time of his or her death to report such a death to the coroner or, in some cases, the State Pathologist. Responsibility for funding and administering the coroners service falls to each local authority. However, the major acute hospitals make their facilities available to local authorities to perform post mortems which are to be conducted under the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">The second category of post mortem is carried out by an attending doctor to gain more information about a death, and is only performed with the consent of the next of kin.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">Facilities to conduct post mortems are located in the major acute hospitals throughout the country. The availability of these facilities varies across the hospital system. In some instances they are open on a seven day basis and in others on a five day basis. I am not aware of any case where a difficulty has arisen, but if the Deputy has a specific example where he would welcome improvement in the facilities and services currently available, my Department will be happy to look into the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_928">The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region. The Air Corps provides the search and rescue, SAR, service off the north west coast while CHCI, a private operator, provides the service from Dublin, Shannon and Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">Late last year, I announced my decision to withdraw the Air Corps from the search and rescue service. This decision was only made following a considered assessment of the capacity of the Air Corps to return to and maintain a full 24 hour service in the north west. As Deputies will recall, the service had been restricted following on from an unusually high incidence of sick leave among the winch crews. There is no plan to reconsider the decision to withdraw from the search and rescue service.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">The Air Corps will continue to provide its current limited service, while the Coast Guard makes alternative arrangements for the return of a full SAR service in the north west. I have been informed by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, that the proposals are still under assessment and a final decision in this regard is expected shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_931">Air Corps pilots will continue to train in search and rescue techniques and it is envisaged that they will provide support in regard to limited non-maritime search and rescue services.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_934">I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 48 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">The most recent meeting of the Government task force on emergency planning was held on Thursday, 22 April. I have scheduled a further meeting for 27 May. The task force has met on three occasions — 18 February, 25 March and 22 April — during 2004. The task force met on a total of nine occasions in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">The Government task force on emergency planning has worked, since it was set up in 2001, to co-ordinate emergency planning and response arrangements across those Departments that lead and support the State's response in an emergency.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">The focus for this work continues to be on making the necessary arrangements to, at best, prevent or at least minimise the risks from terrorist activities, ensuring that the protection available to the Irish people is maximised, putting mechanisms in place to support the response agencies and providing co-ordination for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">Potential threats to the State arising from international terrorism are continuously monitored by those involved, principally the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The advice available to me is that, while the Garda authorities recognise that the terrorist threat to Europe may currently be high, in regard to Ireland it is low. The awareness that the situation could change rapidly, and with little warning, has ensured that vigilance is maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">Should the situation with respect to Ireland change, the Government task force on emergency planning will provide the necessary co-ordination to promote the best use of the State's resources and compatibility between the varying emergency planning requirements. Arrangements regarding security issues that may arise in connection with the EU-US summit to be held in June are primarily a matter for the Garda Síochána. Emergency planning preparations are designed to ensure that as far as possible the necessary advance planning is in place to deal with the consequences of any incident that may arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">A critical issue in an emergency is the question of issuing adequate and timely warnings and providing the necessary information to the general public on threatened or developing emergency situations. The EU civil protection mechanism and other international mechanisms provide Ireland with certain warning and alert systems and mechanisms. Television and radio broadcasting will be the key means of contact with the public in such circumstances but all other means of communication will be utilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">International links have also been important as a means of sharing expertise and resources. The European Union continues to develop programmes to improve co-operation within the Union and prevent and limit any consequences of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear terrorists threats. This was given new impetus by the EU Declaration on Combating Terrorism agreed under the Irish Presidency, which, among other things, emphasises the benefits of co-operation and co-ordination.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">I am pleased to report to this House that there continues to be excellent co-operation between my Department and all other Departments and public authorities. I continue to report regularly to Government on emergency planning, on a confidential basis. I presented the most recent of these confidential reports to Government last October. The report noted that the year had been one of consolidation of emergency planning development. Steps continue to be taken to build on the work done since 2001, formalise the arrangements that have been put in place and lay the groundwork for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">As chairperson of the Government task force, my approach continues to be that such responses should be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements. I will continue this work and I will report regularly to Government and to this House on these matters.</p>

        <b>Mr. Stanton</b>
         asked the

        the measures he has taken or intends to take to adjust the amount of time Naval personnel have to spend at sea; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_524">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_946">In December 2000 I authorised a new organisation for the Naval Service which increased personnel numbers from 959 serving at that time to a new establishment of 1,144. I am advised by the military authorities that there were 1,078 personnel serving in the Naval Service as at 31 March 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">The Naval Service endeavours to operate a planned approach to sea-shore rotation of personnel based on a two year period of commitment to sea-going duties followed by a two year period ashore subject to the exigencies of the service. However, where there are shortages of skilled personnel within the Naval Service, it may be necessary for personnel to carry out sea-going duties more frequently.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">The reorganisation of the Naval Service was designed to ensure that when fully implemented all personnel would spend alternate periods of two years in a shore based appointment followed by two years in a ship based appointment. Two years in a ship based appointment does not imply that people spend two years at sea. On the other hand, some naval personnel are keen to spend more time at sea and, where possible, they are accommodated. Overall, the broad range of strategies adopted by the Naval Service, including continuous recruitment, direct entry officer schemes, direct entry and internal technician schemes, are all focused at achieving sufficient numbers of trained personnel so that the planned approach to sea-shore rotation, based on a two year cycle, is maintained. This helps to ensure that Naval Service personnel do not spend long periods at sea.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">I am aware of the difficulties regarding the deployment of certain technical Naval Service personnel, especially engineering staff, engine room artificers and electrical artificers. The position with engine room artificers is that the number of such appointments in the Naval Service was increased from 76 to 85 following the reorganisation of the Naval Service. A total of 75 engine room artificers are serving at present. The situation will continue to improve as significant numbers of trainee engine room artificers complete their training and come on stream over the next four years. A further 30 apprentices-trainee technicians are currently at various stages in the training process. They will all come on stream over the next four years and will both meet the current shortfall and replace any further wastage that may occur.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">The position with electrical artificers is that the number of such appointments in the Naval Service was increased from 42 to 48 following the reorganisation of the Naval Service. A total of 33 are serving at present. A further 25 are at various stages in the training process and will come on stream in the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">Given the specialist nature of many of the additional positions, it was not possible to fill them all until such time as personnel had completed the necessary training. It was always accepted that it would take a number of years for all appointments to be filled by suitably qualified people.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">While the increased number of specialist appointments could not all be filled instantly, thus creating some transitional short term difficulties, I am assured by the military authorities that the arrangements in place to provide suitably trained and qualified personnel should see an early improvement in the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_969">On 15 January 2003 I approved, in principle, the report of the Reserve Defence Force review implementation board for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the Reserve, which had reported to me in September 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans are currently being prepared within each brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Force. No decisions have yet been taken on the location of proposed newly amalgamated units but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to take part in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits of the reorganisation process in terms of better clothing and improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the Reserve, a better overall organisation structure and opportunities for suitably qualified Reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the Reserve with the Army.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">I am mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current Reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nation-wide geographical spread.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">Planning is ongoing by the military authorities but no final decision on the amalgamation of FCA units will be taken until I have had the opportunity to examine and approve the final amalgamation proposals.</p>

         asked the

        the extent to which further deployment of Irish troops is being considered for overseas missions; the context in which; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_527">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_976">Ireland is currently contributing approximately 735 Defence Forces personnel to 21 different missions throughout the world. The main commitments are to KFOR in Kosovo, with 203 personnel and to UNMIL in Liberia, with 427 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations, the OSCE and the European Union. Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the OSCE, the UN , NATO and the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">In the past year, Ireland reconfigured its commitment in the Balkans replacing the existing military police platoon in SFOR in Bosnia Herzegovina and the transport company in KFOR with an APC Mounted Infantry Company Group in KFOR. The Defence Forces are serving as part of a Finnish battalion with a Swedish led multinational brigade.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">A reorganisation and down-sizing of the NATO led forces in KFOR was planned and had partly commenced when civil disturbances broke out in March this year in Kosovo. That down-sizing has now been deferred to allow the situation to settle. The withdrawal of the Irish contingent was planned as part of this down-sizing and was to have been completed by October 2004. However, having regard to the fragility of the peace in Kosovo, and subject to ongoing assessments of the situation on the ground, Ireland will continue to maintain an appropriate presence in KFOR in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">In making reference to the major outbreak of violence in Kosovo in March, I take this opportunity to commend the bravery and professionalism shown by the 27th Infantry Company Group of the Defence Forces who were in Kosovo at the time of the recent disturbances.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">Ireland's other current major contribution to peacekeeping is in Liberia. Here, Ireland, together with an infantry company group from Sweden, provides the rapid reaction reserve to the UNMIL force commander. Despite the difficult start to this mission, with the tragic death of Sergeant Derek Mooney of the Army Ranger Wing in a road accident, the mission is proving very successful. Ireland was specifically requested by the UN to participate in a substantive manner in this mission, which is a tribute to the high regard in which the UN holds the Irish Defence Forces. I very much welcome the participation of Sweden as part of the Reserve. This type of co-operation reflects the changing dynamics in peacekeeping. The range and diversity of arrangements now in place for peacekeeping allows us to work in tandem with like-minded nations to contribute in a very effective and meaningful manner to peace support operations throughout the world. Interoperability with other forces is a key factor in our involvement in PfP and in our preparations in recent years for the EU Rapid Reaction Force and it is rewarding to see the effects of the hard work put in by the Defence Forces over several years coming to fruition in such a positive way in the peace support role. In regard to our deployment in Liberia, I have already stated that our participation would be for two to three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">In the coming 12 months, we look forward to the take-over by the EU of the current NATO led mission in Bosnia Herzegovina. Ireland has already participated in its first EU mission, Operation Artemis, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and we currently have a number of staff deployed at SFOR headquarters. Subject to the approval of the Government and Dáil Éireann and an appropriate UN mandate, I plan that Ireland will make a substantive contribution to the EU mission in SFOR taking account of available resources and ongoing developments in other peace support missions in which we are involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_983">The Garda Síochána has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. The potential threats to the State arising from international terrorism are continuously monitored by them in co-operation with the Defence Forces. The advice available to me at this time is that, while the Garda authorities recognise that the terrorist threat to Europe may currently be high, in regard to Ireland it is low. Notwithstanding this, it is important that all prudent precautions are taken and that matters are kept under continuous review.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency.

I am pleased to report to this House that there continues to be excellent co-operation between my Department and all other Departments and agencies through these mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">Planning for major accidents and emergencies has been ongoing for many years. This has been carried out at local level and co-ordinated on a regional basis in accordance with the Government major emergency planning framework. As chairperson of the Government task force, I requested all authorities to review their emergency plans and revise as appropriate. This process, which is ongoing, has led to a thorough examination and evaluation of emergency plans to ensure that arrangements are current and effective.</p>

In addition, the Defence Forces have contingency plans in place regarding the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána, and the provision of assistance to the civil authorities for a range of emergency situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">An urgent and detailed review of capacities and procedures to deal with a range of emergencies was undertaken by the military authorities following on from the events of 11 September. It included, <i>inter alia</i>, an update of the threat assessment; intensive contacts with other State agencies; a reassessment of operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army Ranger Wing, ordnance and engineer assets in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search and a review of equipment including the need for air defence. Guidance documents pertaining to aid to the civil power and aid to the civil authorities were also re-assessed. All matters arising were addressed and all procedures updated as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">The capacity of the Defence Forces to deal with major emergencies is kept under constant review. Plans and procedures are updated as necessary and such additional equipment as is required to address any perceived deficiencies is acquired on the basis of identified priorities. Training and preparation for such events is also provided for in the Defence Forces annual training plan.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_529">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_993">KFOR was established on 10 June 1999, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244, for an initial period of 12 months, to continue thereafter unless the UN Security Council decides otherwise. Ireland has participated in the KFOR since August 1999. The mission is authorised under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and was approved by Dáil Éireann on 1 July 1999, following a Government decision of 29 June 1999. Since then, the Government has reviewed and approved, on an annual basis, continued participation by the Defence Forces in KFOR. On 27 May 2003, the Government approved continued participation by a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force in KFOR for a further period of 12 months beyond June 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">It had been anticipated that a reorganisation and scaling-down of KFOR would take place this year. This had partly commenced when civil disturbances broke out in March in Kosovo. The scaling-down has now been deferred on foot of those events. The withdrawal of the Irish contingent was planned as part of this reduction in KFOR presence and was to have been completed by October 2004. However, having regard to the fragility of the peace in Kosovo, and subject to ongoing assessments of the situation on the ground, Ireland will continue to maintain an appropriate presence in KFOR in 2004. In the near future, I intend to bring proposals to Government with regard to the continued participation by the Defence Forces in KFOR beyond June 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">The Irish contingent currently comprises an infantry group of some 203 personnel together with a number of personnel in staff posts at various headquarters. The infantry group was first deployed last September. Previously, a transport group had been deployed with KFOR since August 1999. Three Defence Forces personnel are also serving with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">The role of KFOR is to support the maintenance of civil law and order within Kosovo to develop a climate of safety and security, which will enable the transfer of increased responsibility to the civil authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">The Irish infantry group operates as part of a multinational grouping, within the Finnish battalion. It comprises a Mowag APC mounted company together with support and logistic elements. The main tasks of the Irish infantry group include the following: provision of general security to all ethnic groups, institutions and cultural sites; provision of support to UNMIK police and other agencies with security tasks; identification of and reporting on extremist groups and activities; vehicle and foot patrols; and vehicle checkpoints and operation of observation posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">In referring to the major outbreak of violence in Kosovo in March, I take this opportunity to again commend the bravery and professionalism shown by the 27th Infantry Company Group of the Defence Forces who were in Kosovo at the time of the recent disturbances.</p>

            <p eId="para_1002">The procurement process for the acquisition of new helicopters for the Air Corps has commenced with the preparation of the tender documents in my Department. Following discussions between senior officials in my Department and the military authorities, it has been decided that up to six helicopters will be acquired, two light utility helicopters primarily for Air Corps crew training purposes and four larger utility helicopters for use in support of the Army and for other ancillary uses such as air ambulance. The new aircraft will replace the current fleet of Dauphin, Alouette and Gazelle aircraft. It is expected that the relevant notice for the tender competition will be sent by my Department to the Official Journal of the European Communities shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">The procurement of modern light utility helicopters will provide a significant boost to the Air Corps in available flying hours at reduced maintenance costs, compared to the existing aircraft in the Air Corps helicopter wing. It will also provide increased capability in the roles currently undertaken by the existing Air Corps light utility helicopters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">My decision to proceed with the tender competition was based on the recommendations in the report of the joint military-civil board, which examined the rotary wing requirements of the Air Corps. The report of the board also dealt with the procurement of medium lift helicopters for the search and rescue service in the longer term. However, as the Air Corps will no longer be providing this service, this part of the report will not be implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_1007">Potential officers courses, POC, are held for non-commissioned personnel from time to time within the Defence Forces.

Eligible non-commissioned personnel may also apply for the annual cadetship competitions. The requirement for potential officer courses and commissioning from the ranks, CFR, competitions is reviewed from time to time and is being specifically addressed in the context of the integrated personnel management system, or IPMS, which is one of the major policy initiatives provided for in the White Paper on Defence.

            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1024">I refer the Deputy to my answers to the previous questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">As I stated clearly in my replies to those questions, the Government's White Paper on Defence, published in February 2000, set out a medium term strategy for defence covering the period up to 2010. A major objective of the strategy is to ensure that Ireland has a world class military organisation capable of carrying out the roles assigned to it by the Government, both at home and abroad. This objective requires an ongoing modernisation process, including an investment programme, to ensure that the Defence Forces are properly equipped for these roles.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">In seeking to modernise the Defence Forces, I have been fully conscious of the need to obtain the best possible efficiencies from existing resources. For example, the disposal of assets has been used as a method of financing our re-equipment programme, while the planning and review process of Partnership for Peace has been used as the forum for enhancing the ability of the Defence Forces to operate effectively with contingents from other countries on Petersberg Task type operations. In this way the Defence Forces have been able to make a valuable contribution to peace support operations from within existing resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">In regard to financing of Petersberg Task type operations, Ireland favours maximising a system of financing operations on the basis of costs lie where they fall. This is the basis on which Ireland successfully participates in KFOR and SFOR, and I envisage that our participation in similar Petersberg Task type operations in the future will be similarly financed. The cost implications of the operational activities of the Defence Forces are kept under continual review in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">In addition, I support measures which may emerge within the European Security and Defence Policy which could lead to future efficiencies in defence spending. For example, the creation of an agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments as agreed by the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003, by implementing such efficiencies, could yield economies of scale for the procurement of equipment for the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">Both the development of the agency and the development of an EU rapid response capability with an emphasis on supporting the United Nations in crisis management are issues which are currently under consideration at EU level. Much work remains to be done at EU level on both these issues before any meaningful cost analysis of their implications can be usefully undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">In the context of the broader development of the EU's capacity to carry out both civilian and military crisis management operations, I have continuously advocated that the EU should prioritise the development of qualitative aspects of capability development. I am pleased this view is shared by many of my colleagues at EU level at a time when the majority of member states, including Ireland, has no plans to increase defence spending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">I take this opportunity yet again to remind the Deputy that national sovereignty and voluntarism are, and will continue to be, the fundamental underlying principles of participation in the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP. Accordingly, I do not consider the issues he has raised on the European security strategy and the draft constitutional treaty will alter current Government policy in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1033">Drug abuse has long been recognised as a serious and escalating problem in our society and while there have been relatively few instances of drug related problems within the Defence Forces, it is recognised that the Defence Forces, as a component of the wider community, mirror the community at large. The implications of drug abuse in an organisation where personnel have access to fire-arms are too obvious to require elaboration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">A compulsory substance testing programme was introduced on 1 February 2002, as part of a Defence Forces substance abuse programme, following a long consultative process involving the Office of the Attorney General, the Deputy Judge Advocate General and the Defence Forces representative associations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">Prior to the launch of the programme, an education programme and awareness briefings were conducted throughout the Defence Forces. All personnel were issued with a booklet devised to inform them of the purpose of the new compulsory random drug testing programme, the administrative procedures involved and the sanctions for those who test positive. All necessary measures, including pre-enlistment screening, education, compulsory random drug testing, monitoring and sanctions, will be taken to maintain a drug free environment within the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">The primary objective of compulsory random drugs testing is deterrence. In order to provide a credible level of deterrent, the testing programme has been devised to maximise the possibility of random selection for testing. A trained drugs testing team is responsible for taking urine samples for compulsory random testing throughout the Defence Forces. Testing commenced on 14 November 2002 and the programme is now in its second year of operation. The target of testing 10% of the Permanent Defence Force has been achieved. A member of the Permanent Defence Force, randomly selected, may be required, at any time, to provide a urine sample which will be tested for evidence of use of controlled drugs, the abuse or misuse of other substances or for the detection of the metabolites thereof. A member of the PDF who refuses to provide a urine sample, or who provides a urine sample which tests positive, shall be liable to retirement, discharge or relinquishment of commission or withdrawal of cadetship as appropriate under the provisions of Defence Force regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">I have been advised by the military authorities that a total of 1,611 all ranks have been tested to date. There have been five positive tests. Where personnel have confirmed positive test results, they are discharged or retired in accordance with the relevant regulations.</p>

Once the final report is submitted, I will consider whatever recommendations may be made to me on the ongoing management and control of military ranges.</p>

            <p eId="para_1044">The Garda Síochána has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána, which duties include the protection and guarding of vital installations, the provision of certain security escorts etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">The level and demand for Defence Forces assistance depends on ongoing security assessments undertaken by the Garda. The Defence Forces and the Garda have ongoing consultations on such issues as a matter of course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">The arrangements for the visit of President Bush and the EU-US summit have yet to be finalised and it would be neither productive nor appropriate to speculate on the details at this time. However, the Defence Forces will render such assistance as is deemed necessary and appropriate based on ongoing security assessments.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1050">The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for promotion on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. Female officers are generally being promoted at the same stage in their career as male officers. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">The military authorities advise that the trend for general service recruitment has been that 9% of all applicants have been female and that on average 9% of enlistments have been female. It is obviously not possible to predict what the relevant percentages will be in any future intakes of recruits, but there is no reason to assume this pattern will change to any great degree.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">Some 15.4% of applicants for the 2003 cadetship competition were female. Some 15.5% of successful candidates were female.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">Under the terms of the Employment Equality Act 1998, the Defence Forces are prohibited from operating recruitment policies that discriminate on grounds of gender.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">To encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5' 4", and this height requirement now also applies to male recruits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">The Defence Forces actively encourage female applicants, for example, by advertising: where possible, all graphical advertisements and booklets produced for the Defence Forces show both male and female personnel and emphasise that all applicants are assessed on an equal basis; recruitment fairs — stands at recruiting fairs are generally staffed by male and female personnel; and visits to schools — when the Defence Forces are invited to give talks at all female or at mixed schools, every effort is made to have a female speaker.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">Over the past six years, the strength of female personnel in the Defence Forces has grown from 244 at the end of 1997 to 484 at the end of 2003. In percentage terms this represents an increase from 2.11% to 4.61% of total strength.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">The strength of females in the Defence Forces is provided in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1141">I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 70 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">The roles of the Defence Forces as assigned by Government are set out in the White Paper on Defence, which was published in February 2000. To aid the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána which has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State, is among the assigned roles. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required in duties, which included the security operation surrounding the ceremonies marking the accession of new member states to the EU on 1 May 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">In the case of the recent deployment of the Defence Forces on 1 May, a significant amount of pre-planning was undertaken by the Garda and the Defence Forces in regard to the deployment and the respective roles of the deployed personnel. Defence Forces were mainly deployed at Farmleigh and on the periphery road inside the Phoenix Park. Extensive preparations were put in place by the Defence Forces to provide additional training in riot and crowd control and more than 2,500 personnel were deployed in various roles. In addition, the Naval Service was on patrol in the Irish Sea and the Air Corps provided air traffic control capability and support to operations both at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel and in the park. The Garda air support unit was also very active on 1 May providing top cover support to Garda operations. A temporary restricted flight area was in place over Dublin and the Air Defence regiment provided air defence cover for Dublin Airport, Farmleigh and Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel in this regard. The Defence Forces EOD units, its chemical biological, nuclear and radiological units and its engineering and communications specialists also provided support for the operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">I am glad to say there was no requirement to call on the Defence Forces to provide additional support to the Garda in the maintenance of public order in this instance and that the Garda were able to fully contain the actions of a relatively small number of trouble-makers who endeavoured to breach the security cordon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">With regard to the question of the costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of assistance to the Garda Síochána on 1 May, I am advised that such costs are not readily available due to the extent of the Defence Forces commitment to the operation. However, these costs are currently being compiled and I will arrange to have them forwarded to the Deputy when they are available.</p>

        <b>Mr. Cuffe</b>
         asked the

        the progress in the development of the EU’s common defence policy under the Irish Presidency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
        [13466/04]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_543">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1147">The European Union does not have a common defence policy, and I assume the Deputy is referring to the European security and defence policy, ESDP, and the development of the EU's capability to carry out Petersberg Task operations, namely, crisis management operations, peace support operations and humanitarian tasks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">The year 2003 was important for the development of the European security and defence policy. At the European Council meeting of 19 and 20 June 2003 held at Thessaloniki, the Council noted that the EU has an operational capability across the full range of Petersberg Tasks, limited and constrained by certain shortfalls. The operational capability of the European Union was demonstrated through the launching of four ESDP operations in 2003. These were the EU police mission, EUPM, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Operation CONCORDIA in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, fYROM, Operation ARTEMIS in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the police mission, Proxima, in fYROM, which followed the successful completion of Operation Concordia. These operations have made significant contributions to peace and stability in their respective areas of operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">The Irish Presidency has taken forward a number of key issues relating to the post 2003 development of ESDP. The operational focus of this progress has been maintained. As Deputies may recall, the European Council held in Brussels in December 2003 confirmed the EU's readiness for an ESDP follow-on mission to the UN mandated NATO-led Stabilisation Force in Bosnia Herzegovina. The Irish Presidency has made significant progress on the necessary preparations for this operation. This work has also added an impetus to the development of relations between the EU and NATO.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">Other key issues during the Irish Presidency have related to the development of a new headline goal for 2010, work in regard to the creation, in the course of 2004, of an agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments as agreed by the European Council held at Thessaloniki, and the development of an EU rapid response capability with an emphasis on supporting the United Nations in crisis management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">In this regard, Ireland's commitment to collective security is pursued through the United Nations, which has the primary role in the maintenance of international peace and security. National sovereignty is a fundamental underlying principle of participation in any specific operation which is decided on a case by case basis. Participation in an overseas military operation requires UN endorsement, a specific Government decision and, where the level of participation is to exceed 12, the approval of Dáil Éireann.</p>

            <p eId="para_1154">In addition, the Government agreed in December 2003 to the release of a further series of State lands for inclusion in the initiative including Department of Defence sites at St. Bricin's Hospital, Dublin, and at the Camp Field, Collins Barracks, Cork.</p>

The level of internal review requests to end April in 2004 represents a rate of 10.5% of initial request levels for the period. The internal review level for the first four months of 2004 is therefore broadly consistent with levels for previous years when measured as a percentage of overall requests received in the period.</p>

            <p eId="para_1343">My Department is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for persons with disabilities and to the policies that apply across the civil service generally with regard to the code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">The Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners is responsible for the recruitment of personnel into the civil service and assigns personnel to individual Departments and offices, including my Department. A limited number of appointments are filled directly by my Department, including those of services officer, services attendant, night watchman and cleaner. In addition, a number of civilians are employed with the Defence Forces at military barracks and are mainly engaged in building work and maintenance and on clerical, domestic and other duties. My Department strongly subscribes to the objective of employing persons with disabilities whenever possible. Offices which are open to the public are accessible to people with disabilities. Interpreters are provided at interviews if requested. Disability awareness training has been made available to staff throughout the Department. People with disabilities are entitled to apply for any post for which they are qualified and to have their applications considered on the basis of their abilities, qualifications and suitability for the work in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">The Defence Forces have a derogation from the Employment Equality Act in respect of the criteria of physical ability and age. Therefore, the current age, medical and physical requirements for entry into the Defence Forces reflect the fact that only able bodied and fit recruits can satisfy the difficult and strenuous physical demands of the training and operational environment of the Defence Forces.</p>

            <p eId="para_1423">To aid the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána which has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State, is among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces. In this regard, the Defence Forces assist the Garda as required in duties, which include escorting cash deliveries to banks, post offices and other institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">The final figures for cash escorts for 2003 are now available and the number of requests for such escorts received by the military authorities from the Garda Síochána for 2002 and 2003 were as follows: 2002, 2,516 and 2003, 2,335.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">An annual contribution of €2.86 million is paid by the banks in respect of Army escorts. The contribution from the banks is designed to part cover the total costs to the State of providing cash escorts. An annual contribution is also made to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of the Garda Síochána. In the case of the Defence Forces, taking one year with another, the contribution by the banks has generally covered the non-pay costs of providing such escorts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">The question of the level of contribution is currently under review in my Department having regard to the arrangements, which, I understand, were agreed between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the financial institutions, to ensure that there is no significant variance in methodology or level of cost recovery. It should be noted that there has been a significant reduction in the demand on the Defence Forces for assistance in aid to the civil power following the reduced security threat arising from the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

In particular, a total of 8,000 new NBC suits have been acquired. In addition, the Defence Forces has sufficient stock of respirators for each individual soldier. They also have 98 of the most technologically up to date chemical agent monitors, and Defence Forces personnel are been trained on their operation.

            <p eId="para_1553">The acquisition of new equipment and facilities for the Defence Forces has been a key focus for me since my appointment to the defence portfolio. Significant investment has taken place and I am satisfied that the Defence Forces are now well equipped for their day to day roles at home and overseas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">However, while much has been done and a great deal has been achieved with regard to both equipment and infrastructure, I am aware that more needs to be done. While expenditure programmes will now have to be more prioritised due to the changed financial situation I will ensure that a substantial re-equipment programme will still go ahead to enhance the efficiency, professionalism and safety of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">This year sees the delivery of 25 additional armoured personnel carriers from Mowag of Switzerland, which will give the Defence Forces 65 Mowag APCs in total. The initial contract for 40 APCs saw deliveries completed by March 2002 and was valued at €51 million inclusive of VAT. The value of the additional contract is some €33 million inclusive of VAT with payments spread over the period 2002 to 2005, giving a total expenditure of €84 million on APCs. Eight of the 25 APCs have already been delivered to the Curragh Camp. The remaining seventeen will be delivered by October 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1556">Another significant contract relates to the acquisition of the Javelin missile system from Raytheon-Lockheed Martin in the USA at a cost of some €13 million inclusive of VAT. The purpose of this acquisition is to give Defence Forces personnel an effective, anti-armour capability while on peace support operations. The system will replace the Milan system. Some items under the contract have been delivered recently to allow for the training of personnel. The main delivery is scheduled for 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">There have been ongoing programmes of acquisitions of both nuclear biological chemical, NBC, equipment and night vision equipment, NVE, in recent years and these programmes will continue to meet the ongoing requirements of the Defence Forces. In addition, ten artillery ground surveillance radars have been purchased from Thales Defence in England at a cost of €3.8 million inclusive of VAT. The acquisition of light tactical vehicles, LTVs, for the Defence Forces will also be considered in the light of the ongoing budgetary situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">The main priority for the Air Corps has been the purchase of fixed wing training aircraft. In that regard, I signed a contract on 16 January 2003 for the supply of eight turbo propeller aircraft to replace the Marchetti aircraft in the pilot training role. These aircraft will allow for the continued training of young cadets to the highest standard and are a very realistic response to the needs of the Air Corps at this time. The new aircraft is the Pilatus PC-9M, manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft Limited, Switzerland. The cost of the eight aircraft is approximately €60 million. The first three aircraft have already been delivered and the rest are expected during the summer. While these aircraft are being obtained primarily for pilot training, they will be capable of being armed and as such will have a limited defensive capability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">I have also announced the process to replace the ageing fleet of helicopters in the Air Corps. Following examination of the relevant issues, specifications have been prepared for light utility helicopters and tender competitions for the supply of up to six aircraft will be held shortly.</p>

The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military inter-operability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards. The Defence Forces keep abreast of developments at international level by regular attendance at training courses and seminars, at home and abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_1570">The felling licence referred to was issued in accordance with section 37 of the Forestry Act 1946 following the lodging of a felling notice at the local Garda station. Its issue was in line with revised arrangements for the consideration of felling licence applications in respect of the proposed construction of wind farms on forestry sites, as outlined in Parliamentary Question No. 75 of 15 April 2003. Following a request for clarification as to ownership of the site, the licence was issued to Coillte Teoranta as landowners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">The environmental impact statement referred to was submitted in connection with the application for planning permission which was granted by An Bord Pleanála on the 12 October 1998. It was sent to the Forest Service for information purposes. Local authorities are the planning authorities in respect of deforestation. In line with normal consultation procedures for applications for felling licences, the felling notice was lodged at the local Garda station and the local authority was acquainted by the Forest Service as to the proposed felling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">Under section 41(7) of the Forestry Act 1946, replanting conditions attached to felling licences are binding on the licensee and on each of its successors in title to the land specified in such replanting condition. The felling licence has not been subsequently re-assigned.</p>

            <p eId="para_1631">Private blood tests are given priority in the brucellosis laboratory over round or herd tests. Negative results are normally issued in the afternoon of the day following receipt of the samples in the laboratory. In the case of positive results, an extra one or two days can be required to facilitate extra testing of the samples. Samples received on a Friday are normally issued on the following Monday.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">Special arrangements have been in place since 1999 to allow eligible females and bulls over 12 months of age to move to any number of shows within the validity period of the 30 day pre-movement brucellosis blood test. A copy of the information sheet on these arrangements was issued in late 2003 from my Department to organisers and exhibitors of livestock at shows for 2004 will be forwarded to the Deputy for his information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">Good progress has been made in recent years in reducing the incidence of brucellosis. While I am confident this improvement will continue, there is still a significant reservoir of the disease in many counties and a small number of serious breakdowns continue to occur. Accordingly, we cannot become complacent about this highly contagious disease and all elements of the programme must be retained in their present form.</p>

            <p eId="para_1643">This group reported in September 2000 that allegations about price gaps between the producer and consumer are based on simple comparisons between the level and movement of farmgate prices and retail prices. Such comparisons were inadequate because weight losses involved in converting the live animal into saleable beef were not taken into account. The comparison also ignored cost developments in the post-farmgate sectors of the food chain which account for half the value of the total chain. When these issues were properly considered, the changes in retail prices were fully explained by the combined movement in farmgate prices and post-farmgate costs.</p>

The draft Commission regulations setting out the detailed rules for implementing the direct support schemes have recently been agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1652">Following wide consultations with interested parties, I decided that the best interests of the agricultural industry lay in fully decoupling all direct support schemes from production.

            <p eId="para_1653">The early decision to fully decouple payments from production has enabled my Department to begin the major task of establishing entitlements for all those farmers who received direct payments in the reference years of 2000, 2001 and 2002. Earlier this year my Department invited farmers whose production was adversely affected during the reference years because of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances to make applications for special consideration. Approximately 15,000 applications were received and are being processed. It is hoped that notification of provisional entitlements can be issued to farmers later this year. Notification of definitive entitlements will be issued to all farmers early next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1656">This is in keeping with the pronounced policies of other EU member states where open standards are considered critical to the development and operation of effective and sustainable inter-operability architectures. I understand the Minister of State has been congratulated for emphasising the importance of open standards for inter-operability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1657">The Minister of State did not, as the question states, suggest a choice between open standards software and open source software. She simply pointed out that they were not the same thing and reiterated that, in keeping with procurement law, the Government operates a procurement policy that facilitates open competition, best value for money and best fit to requirements. Within that approach, different products, such as proprietary and open source, are evaluated on their merits, including openness in terms of future procurement and where possible, avoidance of lock-in to a particular supplier. Accordingly, an open view is taken which in practice tends to follow standards emerging from the market. Consequently, with respect to the costs of software, public bodies consider the total cost of ownership which, in addition to the licensing element, should include the issues and costs associated with development and customisation, deployment, warranties and maintenance, performance, security and reliability, management and support, upgrades, training and skills development.</p>

Persons with disabilities are entitled to apply for all competitions held by the commissioners, subject to their meeting the eligibility requirements of the competition in question. Where applicants request special facilities the commissioners make every effort to accommodate them during the selection process. When a person is selected for appointment particular consideration is given to placement and the work environment, for example the provision of special equipment and facilities such as adaptive technology, specialised furniture, reorganisation of work and the provision of additional training which would assist the person in undertaking his or her duties.</p>

            <p eId="para_1673">The issue of the Tobin tax has been considered at a number of fora, including the informal ECOFIN meeting at Liège on 22 September 2001. The then Belgian Presidency of the EU indicated that it wished to pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the Commission on the issue of globalisation. However, most Finance Ministers, myself included, continue to have reservations about the Tobin tax proposal. It was not clear that a further examination of the issue by the Commission would ensure satisfactory answers to the questions concerning the tax. These include the difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax, its doubtful effect on short-term speculative capital movements, its conflict with the basic tenet of free capital movement in the EU, its disproportionate effect on small business and consumers, the probability that the tax would simply drive participants into non-taxable alternatives and the negative impact on liquidity in the foreign exchange market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">Nevertheless, at a formal ECOFIN meeting on 16 October 2001, it was agreed that the Commission would carry out a study on globalisation and that this study would examine the arguments for and against the Tobin tax. The study, Responses to the Challenges of Globalisation, published on 14 February 2002 concluded that "while as a source of additional revenue a currency transaction tax may look appealing, its feasibility is, however, not demonstrated". There have been no further developments at EU level with regard to the possible introduction of the Tobin tax. I do not propose to introduce such a tax as I remain unconvinced of its feasibility.</p>

            <p eId="para_1680">I noted the terms of the motion passed by the Tramore and District Active Retirement Association: "that the contributory senior citizen's pension, the widow's contributory pension and the invalidity pension be granted in full, and that the moneys received from such pensions be not included when assessing income tax".</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">However, it is a general principle of taxation that income from all sources should be subject to taxation and this includes pension income from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Social welfare payments, the old age contributory pension and the old age non-contributory pension are reckonable for tax purposes in line with the majority of social welfare payments such as the retirement, widow's contributory, widow's non contributory and invalidity pensions, the one parent family payment and short-term benefits such as unemployment benefit and disability benefit. The treatment of pensions as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">In my last three budgets, I have increased the age exemption limits for those aged 65 years and over by more than 40% which now stand at €15,500 per annum single and €31,000 per annum married. Elderly persons or couples with annual incomes at or below these limits are not liable to income tax. The extent, if any, to which taxation will arise for an income earner will depend on the level of income which that person has in a tax year. Pensioners aged 65 years and over continue to be treated more favourably under the income tax code than the generality of taxpayers. In addition to the basic personal credit of €1,520 per annum single and €3,040 per annum married and, where applicable, the employee credit, formally known as the PAYE allowance, of €1,040 per annum, income earners aged 65 years and over are entitled to a special age tax credit which is €205 per annum single and €410 per annum married.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">Pensioners and those aged 65 years or over who are widowed persons without dependent children are entitled to a tax-free credit of €300 in addition to the normal personal credits of a single person. Pensioners and those aged 65 years or over who are widowed parents with dependent children have an even more favourable tax treatment. In the year of bereavement, a widowed parent may receive a personal tax credit which is the equivalent to the married tax credit. In the years following this, widowed persons with dependent children receive a one parent family credit in addition to the single personal credit. This ensures that their overall credits are equivalent to that of a married couple for as long as they continue to have dependent children. In the years directly following the year of bereavement, a widowed person with dependent children is also entitled to a bereavement credit. This credit is tapered over five years and amounts to €2,600 in year one, €2,100 in year two, €1,600 in year three, €1,100 in year four, €600 in year five with a reduction to nil thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684">Widowed parents are also entitled to an increased standard rate band at €32,000 per annum. This compares favourably with the single person's tax band of €28,000 per annum. The concessionary treatment is afforded to those aged 65 years or over in the administration of deposit interest retention tax, DIRT. Such persons are entitled to a refund of DIRT paid if their income is at, or below, the age exemption limits mentioned above. The claim for repayment of DIRT is made after the end of the year of assessment. Partial refunds may be due to persons whose income in any tax year did not greatly exceed the exemption limits.</p>

            <p eId="para_1686">The Government has a 3% target for the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service. The annual survey undertaken by my Department of the position on the employment of staff with a disability in the Civil Service shows that 931 people with a disability were employed at the end of December 2002, which is the equivalent to 2.8% of total numbers. This compares with 891 people, 2.78%, in 2001 and 758 people, 2.56%, in 2000. Figures for the end of December 2003 are being compiled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">In view of these figures, it is important to support and assist Departments in implementing the Government's policy. The policy makes a real contribution to the welfare of people with a disability by creating employment opportunities which might not otherwise be available. Every effort is made to ensure that an equal opportunity is given to all candidates applying for competitions for recruitment to the Civil Service. All candidates are requested to identify any special requirements they may have to sit the relevant examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">My Department commissioned independent research into the operation of the 3% target and the career progression of people with a disability in the Civil Service. The report provides useful information about the position of people with a disability working in the Civil Service and makes recommendations for practical steps which can be taken to make certain that the Government's policy operates effectively for the benefit of people with a disability. In the light of the consultants' recommendations, proposals to improve the operation of the policy have been approved by the Government. Discussions will start in the near future between the equality unit in my Department and the Civil Service staff unions on the recommendations. The aim is to agree a new joint approach to the implementation of the target, to improve the existing policy for the benefit of people with disability throughout their careers in the Civil Service, to ensure that the importance of the policy is emphasised, and that Departments will be assisted in implementing the policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1705">Capital acquisitions tax is charged at a flat rate of 20% on the excess of the tax free threshold, known as the group threshold, applicable to a gift or inheritance taken by a person. In arriving at the group threshold for a gift or inheritance received by a person on or after 1 December 1999 from a brother or sister, all gifts and inheritances received by that person since 5 December 1991 from persons in the same group must be taken into account. This is an aggregation of gifts and inheritances from persons in the same group. A beneficiary's brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, lineal ancestors and lineal descendants other than a child, or a minor child of a deceased child, such as grandparents and grandchildren, are all in the same group. This group has a tax-free threshold of €45,644 for gifts and inheritances taken in 2004 having been increased by an indexation factor each year since the year 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">Where a dwelling house is taken by way of a gift or inheritance from a brother or sister, a capital acquisitions tax exemption applies if that dwelling-house was occupied continuously by the beneficiary as his or her only or main residence for a period of three years prior to the date of the gift or inheritance. The beneficiary must not have an interest in any other residential property. It is also a condition of the exemption that the beneficiary must own and reside in the dwelling house for six years after the date of the gift or inheritance. This condition does not apply where the beneficiary is over 55 years or where the beneficiary is unable to comply with the residence requirements for reasons outside his or her control, for example, due to work obligations or hospitalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">A relief from capital acquisitions tax applies where a gift or inheritance of business assets is taken by a nephew or niece who worked substantially on a full-time basis in that business for his or her aunt or uncle for a period of five years prior to the date of the gift or inheritance. A nephew or niece who qualifies for this relief is entitled to the same tax-free threshold as if he or she were a son or daughter of the disponer. This threshold is €456,438 for gifts and inheritances taken in the year 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the capital acquisitions tax code does not allow a credit for tax paid in respect of an event against the capital acquisitions tax liability arising on any subsequent event. In a situation where three siblings are living together, on the death of one of them, a capital acquisitions tax liability can arise in respect of the resulting inheritance. The tax paid is not allowed as a credit against any capital acquisitions tax liability arising on a subsequent death.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">Capital acquisitions tax becomes due and payable on the valuation date in respect of the inheritances taken on the death of each of the three siblings.

If Deputy Cregan has a particular case or set of circumstances in mind, he may wish to contact the Revenue Commissioners for further clarification.</p>

          <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_613">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
            <p eId="para_1711">Over the past number of years the Government has considered carefully the whole area of child care. The core objective of Government policy in the area of child support is to provide assistance which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children. It has been decided that child benefit will be the main fiscal instrument through which support will be provided to parents with dependent children. Child benefit provides assistance to all parents in whatever caring choices are most appropriate for them and their children. Unlike tax relief, it provides support to parents irrespective of their income status.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">In line with this policy approach, the Government commenced a major initiative to increase substantially the rates of child benefit. In 2001, the rate for the first and second child was increased by almost €32 per month and by €38 per month for the third and subsequent children. This represented an increase of more than 50% on the rates prevailing in 2000. Similar monetary increases were provided in 2002. Further increases were implemented in 2003. In the 2004 Budget Statement, I announced additional increases of €6 and €8 per month respectively which came into effect from last month. These increases are around double the projected inflation rate for this year. Since 1997, child benefit rates have increased by more than 230% compared to a projected increase of inflation of only 28% over the period 1997 to 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">There is an exemption to the usual benefit-in-kind provisions for employees who enjoy free or subsidised child care facilities provided by their employers. The exemption also applies if an employer provides child care facilities jointly with others. In such circumstances, the employer must be wholly or partly responsible for both financing and managing the child care facility. However, the employer may opt not to be involved in the management of the child care service. In such circumstances, the benefit-in-kind exemption will be restricted to cases where the employer provides financial support for items of capital expenditure and equipment but not other costs incurred by the employer. This provision was introduced to make the scheme more attractive to employers who did not want the job of managing the facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">Child care services are generally exempt from VAT, so no VAT should be chargeable on fees levied by crèches. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has overall responsibility for the formulation of policy on child care. The supply of formal child care places is being stimulated through a programme of investment under the national development plan equal opportunities child care programme with the funding of almost €437 million provided by his Department and the EU. The purpose of this capital and staffing support funding is to provide almost 27,000 new child care places and to support existing places. This funding and the recent increases in child benefit are a significant financial commitment and clearly show the Government's continuing support for the child care sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">I am satisfied that the Government is providing sufficient support to parents to assist them in meeting the caring costs of their children and to increase the overall supply of child care places which will also help moderate the costs of child care.</p>

            <p eId="para_1717">I do not have information on recruitment practice in the wider public service as this is a matter for relevant Ministers. As Minister for Finance, my responsibility for the Civil Service lies with the Civil Service Commissioners who are responsible for recruitment. Competitions advertised by the commissioners are open to all, including people with disabilities, subject to their meeting the eligibility requirements of the competition in question. Application forms invite applicants to indicate if they have special requirements when undergoing the selection process and the commissioners make every effort to facilitate these requests.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">The Government has a 3% target for the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service. The annual survey undertaken by my Department of the position on the employment of staff with a disability in the Civil Service shows that 931 people with a disability were employed at the end of December 2002, which is equivalent to 2.8% of total numbers. This compares with 891 people, 2.78% in 2001 and 758 people, 2.56% in 2000. Figures for end December 2003 are being compiled. From time to time general service recruitment competitions have been held specifically for those with disabilities. The last clerical officer competition advertised for people with disabilities was in 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">My Department commissioned independent research into the operation of the 3% target and the career progression of people with a disability in the Civil Service. The report provides useful information about the position of people with a disability working in the Civil Service and makes recommendations for practical steps which can be taken to make certain that the Government's policy operates effectively for the benefit of people with a disability. In the light of the consultants' recommendations, proposals to improve the operation of the policy have been approved by the Government. Discussions are under way between the equality unit in my Department and the Civil Service staff unions on the recommendations. The aim is to agree a new joint approach to the implementation of the target to improve the existing policy for the benefit of people with disability throughout their careers in the Civil Service, to ensure that the importance of the policy is emphasised and that Departments are given assistance in meeting the aims of the policy. Consideration will be given to holding special competitions for people with a disability in the light of these discussions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1811">My Department received applications for special educational resources, SER, for the school referred to by the Deputy. SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the national educational psychological service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of SER provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03 which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs. It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment, reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">The detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year. It is intended, also, that schools due to receive the additional posts will be notified within this timeframe.</p>

            <p eId="para_1826">I have received a submission from the IPPN about the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill and have considered it in the context of the preparation of amendments for Committee Stage. I note the contents of the letter submitted to the Deputy by the person in question and feel the issues raised by that letter coincide with those I have already considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">During Committee Stage of the Bill I introduced a number of proposals intended to better reflect in the legislation the proper role of principals. The Bill now reiterates the right of principals to delegate their functions to members of their staff. Principals will also have a right to the assistance of SENOs in carrying out their duties if they feel that is required. In addition, where a principal considers that the assessment of a child believed to have special needs is not practicable or that an education plan prepared by the school will not meet a child's needs, he or she can request the council to arrange the assessment or plan. The voice of principals in the new National Council for Special Education will also be ensured as the Bill now provides for the membership of the consultative forum to include principals' representative organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">I am conscious that this Bill will increase the overall workload within schools and, for the needs of schools to be met, the Bill provides for a five year implementation period and plan. I draw the Deputy's attention to section 12 of the Bill which provides that the resources necessary for the preparation and implementation of education plans will be made available to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">The Bill has completed Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann and will go to Report Stage very shortly, at which time there will be a further opportunity to discuss the issues raised as a result of the Deputy's question.</p>

            <p eId="para_1858">Under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, only eligible children qualify for free transport. To be eligible, children must live at least two miles from and be attending their nearest national school. If a child is not eligible for free transport on distance grounds, he or she may avail of concessionary fare-paying transport subject to there being room available on the service to that school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">All vehicles operating under the school transport scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of Transport. Where vehicles have more than eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department's annual roadworthiness test.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport service on behalf of my Department, places special emphasis on safety and has a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure a safe and reliable service. These are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that standards are maintained. Approximately 2,900 vehicles are used in the school transport fleet. About 2,300 of these are provided by private contractors and the balance by Bus Éireann. Since January 2002, Bus Éireann has replaced more than 200 older school buses, thereby improving the quality of buses in service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1861">Every effort is made by my Department and Bus Éireann to provide an efficient and effective transport service for children with special needs. Approximately 30% of my Department's annual allocation for school transport is expended on transport costs for children with special needs, who represent about 6% of the total number of children carried under the school transport scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1862">The Deputy will appreciate that transport services for both primary and post-primary children must be co-ordinated and bus routes planned in such a way as to provide the most efficient and cost-effective transport service, bearing in mind that the cost of school transport has more than doubled since 1997 to a current cost of €110.471 million.</p>

The trustees have arranged for pupils who would normally have attended this school to attend the Rosary College, which is also in Crumlin.

            <p eId="para_1886">The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person "of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions." The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887">Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address. When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">There is, however, provision under the terms of the scheme for candidates who are re-entering as mature students, following a break in study of at least one year, to pursue or complete an approved course for the first time. Such candidates may be assessed under the terms of the scheme appropriate to the year in which they re-enter. Under this provision, candidates who were not independent mature students at the time of entry to an approved course may be re-classified as independent mature students for the purpose of completing a course or commencing a subsequent course such as a postgraduate course. Similar provisions apply under the terms of the other student maintenance grant schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1896">The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1897">The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a principal and eight mainstream class teachers based on the enrolment of 220 pupils on 30 September 2002. The school also has the services of a learning support teacher, a resource teacher, two posts to cater for educational disadvantage and a shared home school liaison teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_1898">Based on an enrolment of 172 pupils on 30 September 2003, the mainstream staffing for the school year 2004-05 will be a principal and five mainstream class teachers. The school also fulfils the criterion for appointment of an administrative principal based on staffing of a principal plus nine teachers when all posts are counted. In such instances a permanent teacher may be appointed to replace the principal. This will facilitate a staffing of principal and six mainstream class teachers and the net loss of posts as a consequence of applying the staffing schedule is two mainstream posts. There are no plans to adjust the additional posts allocated to the school under various support schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1902">When assessing the need for additional pupil places my Department examines the needs of individual areas rather than regions due to the huge disparities that occur in a large urban area such as Dublin, where individual areas such as Lucan and Dublin 15 are experiencing increased demand for additional primary school places while other areas are experiencing a sharp decline in enrolments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1903">The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration by my</p>
            <p eId="para_1904">Department of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places. My Department is at present concentrating on the areas of major development and population growth with a view to identifying where the most urgent need for new or additional facilities exists or is likely to arise in the future. As part of this process, officials of the school planning section consult regularly with local authorities regarding development proposals and their implications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1905">In addition, standing arrangements are in place for officials of my Department's planning and building unit to meet on a regular basis with officials of the four Dublin local authorities to discuss development proposals and consequent site requirements for new schools. Liaison with existing schools is also an important part of the process as the school authorities would usually alert my Department where in their view the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1906">In the event that the level of development and population growth in an area indicates a likely long-term need for primary or post-primary educational provision, a decision is made on the means by which that need should be met. Generally, this involves the provision of permanent accommodation in the form of a new school or an extension to existing facilities. High-quality temporary or prefabricated accommodation is normally provided to alleviate short-term accommodation needs. Where appropriate, the local authority may be requested to reserve a site for educational purposes. In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity where necessary.</p>

As a rule primary school transport routes are planned so that as far as possible no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1918">My Department holds 28 educational endowments which have a capital value of €1.6 million. The endowments were set up for very specific educational purposes. Thirteen of the endowments were set up under the terms of the Education Endowments (Ireland) Act 1885 and 15 other endowments relate to bequests made to the State where the endower generally had an interest in a particular aspect of education or education in a specific area in Ireland. The payments to the beneficiaries are determined by the terms of the relevant endowment. Seventy seven other endowments are monitored or controlled by trustees and dividends are paid to them, where appropriate, by the commissioners for charitable donations and bequests. My Department has no role in the disbursement of funds from these endowments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">The funds for the endowments held by my Department are mostly invested in Government stocks which provide a reasonable rate of return. The disbursements for endowments held in my name are determined by the terms of the original bequests. Most of the endowments were made in the late 1800s and in the first half of the 20th century and the value of many of the bequests is now only nominal. As the bequests range in value the disbursements are determined by the capital sums held in trust. During 2003, €299,400 was paid out from the endowments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1934">My Department has received an application for special educational resources, SER, for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including one for the pupil in question, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of SER provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1936">The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1937">In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs, and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1938">It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment, reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1939">The detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year. It is also intended that schools due to receive the additional posts will be notified within this timeframe.</p>

            <p eId="para_1944">The selection and enrolment of pupils in second-level schools is the responsibility of the school management authorities. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. However, where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1945">Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process whereby a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment of a student. An appeal will generally not be admitted unless it is made within 42 calendar days from the date the decision of the board of management was notified to the parent or student concerned. However, a longer period for making appeals may be allowed as an exception where it is accepted that circumstances did not permit the making of an appeal within the 42-day limit. Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil. My Department will contact the parents of the child referred to by the Deputy to advise them on the section 29 appeals procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">In addition, under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, the primary function of the education welfare board is to ensure that each child in the State attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an appropriate education. Through its educational welfare officers the board provides a welfare-focused service that is accessible to parents, school and others concerned with the educational welfare of young people.</p>

            <p eId="para_1970">Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of secondary schools, which are privately owned. It would not be reasonable to expect the state to meet the full insurance costs of privately owned buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1971">Funding is provided to secondary schools by way of <i>per capita</i> grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in general a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items such as insurance. I also hold the view that moving to a position where the Government covers the insurance costs of secondary schools may encourage the insurance sector to keep increasing premiums on the basis that the State would meet the cost. Such an approach would also reduce the incentive for school management to reduce risks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">I am committed to improving the funding position of secondary schools in the light of available resources. At a time of increased financial constraints, the recent announcement of further significant increases in the funding of primary and secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">In the case of primary schools the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57 in 1997 to €121.58 per pupil from 1 January last, an increase of almost 113%. In the case of secondary schools, the standard per capita grant now amounts to €274 from 1 January last as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. In addition, the support grant, which was introduced under the school services support initiative, was also increased from 1 January last and now stands at €131 per pupil. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school per annum that was approved in December 2001. A measure of the increase in overall funding for secondary schools is that by comparison with 1997, a secondary school with 500 pupils now receives extra annual funding of up to €108,000 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1974">Officials of my Department met with representatives of Allianz, the main insurance provider in this sector, in November 2003 and explained that in the period 1998 to 2002 total premiums increased by 70%, of which 50% was attributable to indexation and the remaining 20% to rating increases. It was estimated that the increase for 2003 was 10%. It was anticipated that there would be no increase in 2004, with the possible exception of very large schools where reinsurance factors would be outside the norm.</p>
            <p eId="para_1975">Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums is a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the Tánaiste is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. In this context, the Tánaiste has announced a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. Key initiatives in the reform programme include the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board, the undertaking of a joint study into insurance in conjunction with the Competition Authority and other initiatives in association with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>

Departmental staff are recruited through the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners. People with disabilities are entitled to apply for any post advertised by the Office of Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners for which they hold the basic entry requirements and to have their applications considered on the basis of their abilities, qualifications and suitability for the work in question. Special panels are established from time to time arising out of competitions from which candidates who are registered or are entitled to be registered with the National Rehabilitation Board are assigned to Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1980">It is the strict policy of the commissioners that no unnecessary obstacle is placed in the way of people with disabilities applying for positions. At present the commissioners make all reasonable efforts to provide such special facilities and equipment as are necessary to enable people with disabilities to take part in their recruitment processes. These include Braille test material and enlarged scripts for visually impaired candidates; interpreters made available for deaf candidates attending for tests or interviews; audio-taped test material coupled with HAL screen reader, where feasible; extra large desks where required; wheelchair access and toilet facilities in test and interview locations and one-to-one testing where considered necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_2085">At the outset I should make the point that, even prior to the enactment of the Official Languages Act 2003, my Department was already meeting the required standards of bilingual practice in areas, for example, such as signage, stationery and in publications such as the Department's statement of strategy, annual report and customer charter. The Act in these areas therefore involves no extra costs for the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">As the Deputy is aware, the Act provides for preparation in due course by my Department, and individually by each of the public bodies under its aegis listed in the first schedule to the Act, of a scheme for the delivery of our services in the Irish language to the general public. I am informed that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is preparing guidelines to assist public bodies in preparing these schemes. It is anticipated that the guidelines will finalised in the near future. As my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, has already informed the House, it is anticipated then that the first tranche of public bodies will be asked to prepare draft schemes for approval by him once the draft guidelines have gone through the necessary statutory consultation procedure. When my Department has prepared its draft scheme, I will be in a position to say what, if any, additional costs may arise in its implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">In so far as the public bodies funded by my Department are concerned, the preparation of schemes in accordance with the Act and guidelines referred to above, including an assessment of any additional costs arising, is a day to day matter for each of the public bodies concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_2090">I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 271 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">My Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Belfast, DHSSPS, commissioned a feasibility study and report on the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service, HEMS, for the island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">The report of the consultants appointed to undertake the study was published on 30 April 2004 and is available on my Department's website. The study identifies possible roles for a helicopter emergency medical service, HEMS. These include a primary response; travelling directly to the scene of an incident to take the patient to hospital, and an inter-hospital response; the planned rapid transfer between hospital of patients requiring specialist care, escorted by skilled professionals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">The study concludes that an inter-hospital transfer service would be the most appropriate in an all-island context. The study indicates that this would involve significant capital investment and annual operating costs. The estimated cost is €12 million capital and €4 million annual operating costs for a single helicopter. Additional helicopters could be added with an additional annual cost for each aircraft of over €3 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">A three year programme of work would be needed to establish HEMS including procurement of aircraft, identifying and constructing landing sites, developing cross-Border communications and control systems, producing service protocols and cross-Border management agreements, including funding and payment, staff recruitment and training and arrangements for integration with existing hospital and ambulance services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2095">My Department is exploring options in relation to HEMS development in the light of the study. As part of this exercise, it has initiated discussions with the Department of Defence and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which manages the Irish Coast Guard.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
            <p eId="para_2099">In Ireland there is no established ratio of nurse to patient. This ratio varies in different healthcare settings and is related to the changing phenomenon of patient acuity. Patient dependency measures do exist and various methods have been utilised but this is decided at a local level rather than at a national level. The commission on nursing recommended the examination and development of appropriate systems to determine staffing levels and to this end a group was established in the Department of Health and Children and is currently undertaking this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">Furthermore, the CEO of each health board has responsibility for the management of the workforce in public nursing homes, including the appropriate staffing mix, precise grades of staff employed in line with service priorities. It is a matter for each employer to ensure that staff in their employment have adequate training and skills to perform the duties expected of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2101">Direct care of patients is undertaken by either professional nurses or health care assistants. It is Government policy that carers are referred to as health care assistants and that their education and training is standardised. All health care assistants should be educated to NCVA level 2 of FETAC. The national programme to implement this throughout the public health service is in its infancy. A module specifically for care of the older person has been developed and is currently undergoing validation by FETAC and should be available in the autumn. This training programme is available to private nursing homes and can be purchased through the nursing and midwifery planning and development unit in each health board area. Alternatively, nursing homes can establish their own programme. It is a matter for each employer to manage the ratio of staff to patient in the services they provide in light of their duty of care to patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_2102">The responsibility for the provision of occupational and recreational facilities rests with the nursing homes in the first instance. Age and Opportunity's Bealtine Festival is open to all older people regardless of their location and provides older people with the opportunity to be involved in creative activities. In public health institutions, some activity nurses have been appointed and are involved in supplying such therapies as reminiscence therapy, cognitive therapy and acupuncture.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">Privacy to undertake personal activities should be facilitated wherever possible. However, leaving residents unsupervised may result in an increase in falls. Of older people living in the community, 20% fall each year sustaining serious injury. This figure is thought to be higher for hospitalised elderly and up to two thirds of older women living in nursing homes fall at least once per year. Many of these falls result in serious injury. Ultimately, the level of competency of the individual should be assessed and patients should be afforded privacy where possible, however, this must be balanced against overall concerns for the persons' safety.</p>

            <p eId="para_2112">The national breast screening programme commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Midland Health Board and the North Eastern Health Board region. Last year I announced the extension of the BreastCheck programme to Counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford and also the national roll-out to the southern and western counties. Screening commenced in Wexford in March of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2113">The BreastCheck clinical unit in the western area will be at University College Hospital, Galway, with two associated mobile units. The area of coverage is counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and Tipperary NR. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the southern area will be located at South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, with three associated mobile units. Counties covered include Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary SR. When these units are in place a BreastCheck service will be available to the target population in every county in Ireland. The national roll-out of BreastCheck requires detailed planning to include essential infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2114">Two project teams, one in each region, have been established to develop briefs for the capital infrastructure needed for the static units in the south and west. In relation to the southern region, the South Infirmary considered it necessary to commission a site strategy study to ensure the integration of the breast screening service into the present and future development of the hospital. My Department made available a capital grant of €230,000 for the study to be undertaken by professional architectural, engineering and quantity surveying experts. This study is now complete and was submitted to my Department at the end of March and a detailed brief is now being prepared by BreastCheck and the hospital. As regards the west, BreastCheck submitted a number of options for the construction of a static unit on the grounds of University College Hospital, Galway. Both projects are being considered by my Department in the context of the framework for capital investment 2004-8 which is being discussed with the Department of Finance at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">An essential element of the roll out of the programme is investment in education and training of radiographers. BreastCheck employs qualified and experienced radiographers who have specialised postgraduate training and qualifications related to mammography. BreastCheck and the symptomatic breast cancer services combined have a significant ongoing recruitment and training requirement in this area. Last year I announced the development of a training centre for radiographers and mammography at Eccles Street which will become the National Training Centre in Breast Imaging. Resources are being made available to BreastCheck to support this initiative which will cost in excess of €750,000. Design specification work has been undertaken, the core elements of the training programme are being addressed and the recruitment process for a course leader has been initiated.</p>

            <p eId="para_2137">The report of the national task force on medical staffing — Hanly — envisages St. Columcille's Hospital being developed as a local hospital. The report recommends investment in local hospitals such as St. Columcille's so that they are in a position to provide most of the local population's needs for hospital care. Improvements proposed include a greatly expanded proportion of elective day surgery and elective medical procedures for the region in a range of specialties — this will involve an increasing volume of elective procedures that are often currently performed in the larger hospitals; a strong focus for locally accessible multi-specialist day and out-patient, OPD, care; pre and post-natal maternity services; a point of access for general practitioners to services and diagnostic facilities and rehabilitation and long-stay care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2138">Implementation of the report in the East Coast Area Health Board will ultimately involve the appointment of an additional 129 consultants to the region, many of whom will provide services in local hospitals, including St Columcille's.

            <p eId="para_2209">Public hospital services were introduced in June 1991. As a result everyone, regardless of income, is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. At present these charges are set at €45 per night, subject to a maximum of €450 in any 12 consecutive months, in respect of inpatient public hospital services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2210">Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Any patient, whether a medical card holder or not, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is liable for the costs relating to such treatment</p>
            <p eId="para_2211">In respect of people availing of public long-stay care, charges can be made under two regulations. They can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for Inpatient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital inpatient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days in the previous year. The regulations provide that a charge is made at a rate not exceeding the person's income. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_2212">Charges may also be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1965 where a patient receives shelter and maintenance rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission. They are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2213">In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of a CEO of the relevant health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</p>

            <p eId="para_2226">The administration of the registration system is statutorily a matter for an tArd-Chláraitheoir or Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for registrars who operate under his general direction.</p>
            <p eId="para_2227">I presume the Deputy is referring to deaths that were referred to a coroner. The Registrar General has informed me that he must await a coroner's decision on the cause of death before it can be registered. Following the referral of a case of sudden death a coroner may refer a sample or samples from the autopsy to the State Laboratory for detailed analysis to assist in determining the cause of death. He must wait for the results before issuing his decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2228">The State Laboratory operates under the aegis of the Department of Finance. It knows how important its service is to the coroners and the impact it inevitably has on relatives of people whose deaths are the subject of inquests at a time of great distress. The laboratory constantly monitors its service by reviewing available resources, the possibilities for outsourcing and the complexity of analyses. There is a general increase in the complexity of the analyses required by coroners, resulting in approximately three analyses per sample received. Reports are made on the vast majority of samples within six months of receipt in the State Laboratory.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">Additional resources were allocated to the State Laboratory's toxicology section resulting in a substantial increase in the number of analyses completed. A backlog of cases still exists due to a 50% increase in the past two years in the number of cases referred and a general increase in the complexity of the analyses required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2230">At present a range of measures are being taken to reduce the turnaround time of samples sent to the laboratory and processed by its toxicology section. The laboratory will give additional priority to the coroners' cases. Its management is also reviewing the procedures and processes in the toxicology area with a view to automating as much as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2231">The possibilities of reducing the complexity of testing were discussed between the State Laboratory and the coroners and their representatives. Such a measure would have an immediate impact on turnaround times. It was not considered possible to reduce the complexity of tests performed by the laboratory due to the constant demand by families for comprehensive analysis, the increasing complexity of the cocktail of drugs potentially taken by victims that requires sequential analyses and coroners' requirement for quality analytical data that will withstand scrutiny in court.</p>

            <p eId="para_2257">At a meeting which I had with the survivors of symphysiotomy, the SOS group late last year, I agreed that a range of measures would be put in place by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards to support the group. The current position is as follows. The health boards and the relevant voluntary hospitals in the eastern region have appointed liaison officers, who are meeting patients who have undergone symphysiotomy to discuss their healthcare needs. The chief executive officers of the health boards and the ERHA have agreed to grant GMS eligibility, based on medical grounds, to SOS patients who do not have such eligibility. A special patient identifier card will be issued which will facilitate the health care system to fast-track patients for appointments and treatments. The CEOs' group is finalising arrangements for the establishment of care pathways and for a multi-disciplinary medical team to be made available in respect of the patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_2258">The ERHA and the health boards are proceeding to ascertain the number of symphysiotomies carried out in hospitals throughout the country. It may take some time to complete this process as procedures may have been carried out in maternity units or in hospitals that no longer exist. An exercise is ongoing, in conjunction with the SOS group, to profile patients in order to assist in formulating a needs assessment for each individual. Independent counselling services are available to all patients where requested. An information leaflet has been prepared in consultation with the SOS group and is expected to issue from the ERHA and health boards to general practitioners and patients shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2259">Independent clinical advice is available, on request, to patients who have undergone symphysiotomy. This has already been availed of by a number of members of the SOS group. Discussions are ongoing with the SOS group regarding the setting up of an information line which would be staffed by appropriate healthcare personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_2260">The chief medical officer of my Department has contacted an international expert with a view to undertaking an external review of the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland and discussions are continuing in this regard.</p>

In effect, the RIA is to a very significant extent reliant on the accommodation and related facilities offered to it on a contractual basis by private sector operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_2436">Notwithstanding these difficulties, the RIA's policy in relation to accommodation procurement and placements is to ensure, in as much as possible, the maintenance of a sensitive, balanced and proportionate approach nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_2437">In procuring direct provision accommodation and ancillary facilities, specific regard is had to the following: type of accommodation being offered — hotel, guest house hostel etc.; location; local population and numbers of asylum seekers, if any, already residing in the area; local infrastructure — transport, schools, hospitals, shops etc.; facility being offered by proprietor — recreation, communal rooms, en suites etc.; facilities for other agencies — health boards, refugee legal services etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2438">Finally, the RIA does not place asylum seekers in the private rented sector. Any such accommodation arrangements are made by asylum applicants themselves on foot of rent supplement payments made by the health boards. The RIA has no role in this regard nor in regard to where individual asylum seekers who are in receipt of any such payments take up accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2440">I assume the Deputy is referring to the optional period of eight weeks additional maternity leave provided for in section 14 of the Maternity Protection Act 1994 which may be taken immediately after maternity leave. Section 22(2) of the 1994 Act provides that during additional maternity leave the employee is still in an employment relationship with the employer and retains rights in relation to that employment. However, the period of additional maternity leave is not counted as reckonable service and, therefore, there is no entitlement to any right based on reckonable service during the additional maternity leave period. Consequently, some employees may have their annual leave entitlement reduced on a <i>pro rata</i> basis in respect of an absence on additional maternity leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_2441">As the Deputy knows, the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 is currently progressing through the Oireachtas. Section 14 of the Bill addresses this issue by providing that an employee's absence from work on additional maternity leave will count for all employment rights associated with the employment, except remuneration and superannuation benefits such as annual leave. I am hopeful that the Bill will be enacted during the current session.</p>

            <p eId="para_2443">The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 1994 applies to all female employees regardless of the nature of their employment contract who have notified their employer of their condition and to male employees on the death of the mother following the recent birth of the child.

            <p eId="para_2444">Furthermore, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 provides that an employee on a fixed-term contract cannot be treated less favourably in relation to conditions of employment including pay and pensions and maternity protection than a permanent comparator employed by the same or associated employer or an employer in the same industry or sector and doing the same or similar work or work of equal value as that permanent comparator.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_768">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_2446">I understand that an application from the first group for a substantial capital grant of over €2.6 million and an associated staffing grant was submitted some time ago. An application from the second group for a substantial capital grant of almost €1.5 million and an associated staffing grant was also submitted some time ago. This was a revised application and my Department had previously made a feasibility grant available to the group to enable it to develop the project. My Department cannot trace the third group named as no reference number was supplied but I will be happy to give the Deputy an update if the full name of the third project can be given.</p>
            <p eId="para_2447">The day to day administration of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, EOCP, is undertaken by Area Development Management Limited, which has been engaged by my Department to carry-out thorough assessments against the programme criteria of all applications for grant assistance under the programme, on my behalf. All large scale capital projects such as these applications from Ballyfermot, are referred by ADM Limited, to an independent external building specialist to assess the suitability of the proposal and its value for money. On completion of the assessment process, applications are considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, which makes a funding recommendation to me before I make a final decision on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2448">The EOCP is a seven year development programme, the progress of which was commented upon very favourably by the mid-term evaluators of both the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Expenditure under the programme covers the period to end 2007 and must take place in a planned manner as must grant approvals to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_2449">There has been considerable demand from community based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community based child care facilities and indeed to support capital developments in the private child care sector. ADM on behalf of my Department is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date, numbering over 1,100 and at a value of €114 million, to ensure that grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed and, if they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project.</p>
            <p eId="para_2450">In addition, my Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP including the capital programme to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme's objectives. Some transfers between measures were recommended and require the approval of the regional assemblies. I expect that this technical process will be completed shortly and that it will bring to at least €157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present EOCP. This amount includes an element for the administration by ADM Limited of the capital programme. At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which currently amounts to about €35 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2451">I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government's commitments to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline, including these Ballyfermot projects, are being reviewed again by ADM Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority. The review process will be repeated as necessary to maximise the benefits deriving from this phase of the EOCP.</p>
            <p eId="para_2452">I do not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the EOCP and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing work force will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Indeed, should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I would expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2453">I am also very much aware that participation in or preparation for employment is an important step towards social inclusion and self reliance for persons who may have ended their formal education before achieving a school certificate and therefore social disadvantage is another key element of the EOCP, which makes grant assistance available towards the staffing costs of many community based child care facilities which provide child care for disadvantaged families. The projects mentioned by the Deputy are being reviewed as part of this prioritisation process and it would be premature of me to comment further on specific applications for grant assistance at this time.</p>

        the position regarding the talks with the disability groups; and if the Government has decided on a date for the publication of the disability Bill.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_2455">The agreed programme for Government established the Government's commitment to complete consultations on the disability legislation and to bring an amended Bill through the Oireachtas. As the deputy will be aware, the Government has facilitated extensive consultation nationally in relation to disability legislation, giving disability groups and the disability legislation consultation group, DLCG, in particular an opportunity to present their proposals for a disability Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_2456">In April 2002 the Government appointed an expert consultation team to oversee the national consultation process. This comprised experts in legal, economic and social affairs. The team met and received the views of the stakeholders, including the DLCG, the social partners, the community and voluntary sector and relevant Departments before completing its task in February 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_2457">Many Deputies will know that the DLCG is a group representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers which was brought together by the National Disability Authority, NDA, to facilitate dialogue at national level, both within the sector and with the consultation team. Broad ranging consultations took place in 2002 and early 2003 following which the DLCG presented the document Equal Citizens — Proposals for Core Elements of Disability Legislation in February 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_2458">Last year, the DLCG had meetings with a number of members of the Government, including the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley. The discussions at these meetings covered such matters as assessment of need, standards, service provision, the need to build capacity in key sectors of the public service so as to allow provision of disability accessible services in a cost effective way and workable redress mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_2459">Earlier this year, meetings took place between officials and the DLCG at which it was given an outline of the proposals for legislation. Its views about these proposals were discussed and noted for consideration by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion. At present, contact is continuing between the group and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, with a view to a further possible meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_2460">The disability Bill is a key part of the framework being put in place by the Government to underpin the equal participation by people with disabilities in Irish society. The framework includes the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003, which is currently on Report Stage; the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill which is being prepared in the Department of Social and Family Affairs dealing with the provision of advocacy; sectoral plans for key public services; and equality legislation, to be updated by the Equality Bill 2004, which is currently on Second Stage in the Dáil.</p>
            <p eId="para_2461">The Government is conscious of the complexity and cross-cutting nature of the issues involved and, to support ministerial engagement throughout the process, referred oversight of the Bill and other elements of the framework to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion. The Government and the sub-committee are giving particular attention to the Bill and to the views arising through the consultation process. The Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation and will be published as soon as the Government has completed its work.</p>

            <p eId="para_2464">As the Deputy may be aware, while the Government actively makes supports available for the development of child care and for its delivery in areas of disadvantage, it is not directly involved in the provision of child care. The equal opportunities child care programme provides capital grant assistance to community-not for profit organisations and to private child care providers to increase the supply of child care places and to enhance the quality of existing places. It offers staffing grants to community based-not for profit organisations which have a focus on disadvantaged families. It is open to community based not-for-profit groups and to private child care providers to apply for funding under the programme and all applications will be considered in the light of the available funding and in keeping with the criteria of the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2475">On 12 February 2004 I attended the AGM of Nutley Residents' Association with the person referred to by the Deputy. The meeting was also attended by Deputies and other local representatives and election candidates for the area. During the course of the meeting the chairman of the association indicated to those present that the local community garda, who is usually in a position to outline the level of crime and police activity in the area, was unable to attend. The chairman, and not the person referred to by the Deputy, then asked me publicly whether I would be able to obtain the figures for the Nutley area and make arrangements to have any such information conveyed to the residents. I undertook to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_2476">The day following the meeting I wrote as promised to the superintendent in Donnybrook Garda station from my constituency office in Ranelagh and told him that I had been asked by the residents' association for crime figures and general information which would have been available to the association if the community garda had been able to attend. The superintendent acknowledged my letter on 19 February and supplied the information in question in early March. I asked my party's local representative, the person referred to by the Deputy and who attended the meeting with me, to ensure that every resident in the area was given the information, and I understand that she arranged for it to be distributed to all relevant households.</p>
            <p eId="para_2477">The information sought related to the Nutley area only. It was sought by me solely at the request of the chairperson of Nutley Residents' Association. All information received is now in the public domain as requested at a public meeting attended by local representatives and candidates from all political parties. None of those representatives or candidates asked me subsequently to give them the information which was distributed. However, if they had asked me, I would have been glad to give them the same information as I arranged to be given to the householders.</p>
            <p eId="para_2478">I released the information requested by the association in exactly the same format as I received it. The person referred to by the Deputy has not asked me for any other information regarding Irishtown, Donnybrook or any other area as suggested.</p>

My request for information was made at the expressed request of the chairman of a meeting at which that local election candidate was present. That candidate heard the undertaking both to seek the information and to distribute it to residents. That candidate made no objection publicly or privately to that request or to my undertaking in response.</p>

            <p eId="para_2496">I have been informed by Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength, including all ranks, of Tallaght Garda station as at 10 May 2004 was 164. That compares with a figure of 133 as at 31 December 1997 and represents an increase of 31, or 23.3%, since that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2497">A divisional crime prevention officer attached to Tallaght Garda station operates within the boundaries of the Dublin metropolitan region (south) division.</p>
            <p eId="para_2498">At present 20 community gardaí are allocated to ten specific neighbourhoods in Tallaght covering 43 neighbourhood watch schemes. One sergeant and four gardaí are assigned to JLO duties in the Tallaght Garda district. The strength of all community policing units is reviewed periodically.</p>
            <p eId="para_2499">Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the Tallaght area with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_2500">The situation will be kept under review, and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Tallaght Garda station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2501">There are three Garda youth diversion projects in the Tallaght Garda district namely: KEY, or Key to Engaging Youth, Killinarden, Fettercairn and Glenshane; JAY, or Jobstown Action for Youth; and YEW, or Youth Enhancement in Whitechurch.</p>
            <p eId="para_2502">Garda youth diversion projects are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seek to divert young persons from becoming involved — or further involved — in anti-social or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2503">A total of €296,420 was made available in 2003 to the three projects in the Tallaght district. Funding of €5.318 million has been allocated for the Garda youth diversion projects in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2504">The probation and welfare service has established a dedicated youth justice team covering the south side of Dublin, including the Tallaght area. A probation and welfare officer based on that team is currently working with offenders under 18 years residing in the Tallaght area. In addition, it is also intended that a member of the youth justice team work closely with a designated probation and welfare officer on the Tallaght court team to implement family conferencing which is a new disposal under the Children Act 2001. Probation and welfare officers working with young offenders in the Tallaght area endeavour to access all suitable projects and facilities that would minimise the marginalisation of the young person.</p>
            <p eId="para_2505">An extension of Lions Villa Hostel, Chapelizod, was completed in 2002 costing over €1 million. This is a residential facility for young offenders, some of whom may come from the Tallaght area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2506">Currently the probation and welfare service, through the Office of Public Works, is in negotiations with a developer in the Tallaght area to secure a large purpose-built building to be used by the Tallaght probation project and as an assessment centre under the Children Act 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_2507">In addition, the Garda Síochána Bill 2004 proposes a formalised consultation process in the form of local policing committees which will formulate and oversee the implementation of measures of co-operation between the local authority and the gardaí aimed at reducing crime and disorder and combating the misuse of alcohol and drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2508">The Deputy may also be aware of the sanctions and procedures, including family conferencing and so on set out in the Children Act 2001. Furthermore, there are a wide range of support services available through the Department of Education and Science for children with difficulties, such as the National Education Welfare Board and the National Education Psychological Service.</p>

            <p eId="para_2576">I understand that an application from this group in County Limerick for a substantial capital grant of almost €1.35 million was submitted some time ago and that there has been considerable dialogue between the project and Area Development Management Limited on aspects of the proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2577">The daily administration of the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006 is undertaken by Area Development Management Limited which has been engaged by my Department to carry out thorough assessments against the programme criteria of all applications for grant assistance under the programme, on my behalf. All large-scale capital projects are referred by Area Development Management Limited to an independent external building specialist to assess the suitability of the proposal and its value for money. This external appraisal has been completed. On completion of the assessment process, applications are considered by the programme appraisal committee chaired by my Department which makes a funding recommendation to me before I make a final decision on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2578">The EOCP is a seven year development programme, whose progress received favourable comment from the mid-term evaluators of the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Expenditure under the programme covers the period to the end of 2007 and must take place in a planned manner as must grant approvals to ensure that it can meet its financial commitments at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_2579">There has been considerable demand from community-based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community-based child care facilities and to support capital developments in the private child care sector. Area Development Management Limited on behalf of my Department, is carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date, numbering more than 1,100 and at a value of €114 million, to ensure that grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed and, if they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project.</p>
            <p eId="para_2580">In addition, my Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP, including the capital programme, to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme's objectives. Some transfers between measures were recommended and require the approval of the regional assemblies. I expect that this technical process will be completed shortly and that it will bring to at least €157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present EOCP. This amount includes an element for the administration by Area Development Management Limited of the capital programme. At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which currently amounts to about €35 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2581">I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government's commitments to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline, including this Limerick project, are being reviewed again by Area Development Management Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered and the capacity of a group to complete a project before the end of the programme. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority. The review process will be repeated as necessary to maximise the benefits deriving from this phase of the EOCP.</p>
            <p eId="para_2582">The success of the present strand of the EOCP and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing workforce will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, the programme would again benefit from transfers. Pending the outcome of the Area Development Management Limited review, it would be premature of me to comment further on specific applications for grant assistance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2670">An application from this group for a substantial capital grant of almost €2.8 million and an associated staffing grant was submitted in February 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2671">The daily administration of the equal opportunities child care programme 2000 — 2006 is undertaken by Area Development Management Limited which has been engaged by my Department to carry out thorough assessments against the programme criteria of all applications for grant assistance under the programme on my behalf. All large scale capital projects are referred by Area Development Management Limited to an independent external building specialist to assess the suitability of the proposal and its value for money. This external appraisal has been completed. On completion of the assessment process, applications are considered by the programme appraisal committee chaired by my Department which makes a funding recommendation to me before I make a final decision on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2672">The EOCP is a seven year development programme, whose progress received favourable comment from the mid-term evaluators of the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Expenditure under the programme covers the period to end 2007 and must take place in a planned manner as must grant approvals to ensure that it can meet its financial commitments at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_2673">There has been considerable demand from community-based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community-based child care facilities and to support capital developments in the private child care sector. Area Development Management Limited on behalf of my Department, is carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date, numbering more than 1,100 and at a value of €114 million, to ensure that grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed and, if they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project.</p>
            <p eId="para_2674">In addition, my Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP including the capital programme to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme's objectives. Some transfers between measures were recommended and require the approval of the regional assemblies. I expect that this technical process will be completed shortly and that it will bring to at least €157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present EOCP. This amount includes an element for the administration by Area Development Management Limited of the capital programme. At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which currently amounts to about €35 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2675">I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government's commitments to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline, including this Limerick project, are being reviewed again by Area Development Management Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered and the capacity of a group to complete a project before the end of the programme. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority. The review process will be repeated as necessary to maximise the benefits deriving from this phase of the EOCP.</p>
            <p eId="para_2676">The success of the present strand of the EOCP and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing workforce will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, the programme would again benefit from transfers. Pending the outcome of the Area Development Management Limited review, it would be premature of me to comment further on specific applications for grant assistance.</p>

The visa appeals officer who examined the application took into account the information provided in support of the application, the applicant's ties and general circumstances in her country of origin, her immigration history, as well as the relative attractiveness and feasibility of the applicant remaining in the State. The Department's approach in these matters is informed by past experience, including experience of abuse of the system. In this instance, the visa appeals officer formed the opinion that it would not be reasonable to conclude that the applicant would observe the conditions attached to the visa and the decision to refuse the application was upheld. It is open to the applicant to make a fresh application with up to date supporting documentation and the matter will be considered anew.</p>

            <p eId="para_2748">The scheme is fourth in the list of sewerage schemes submitted by the council in response to my Department's request to local authorities in 2003 to produce updated assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The assessments were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2004-2006 published last week. Given the rating afforded to the scheme by the council, it has not been possible to include it in the programme.</p>

Of this, the cost of the voting machines themselves is some €40 million, including VAT. Recoupment has been advanced from the control fund by the Department of Finance to returning officers who are also responsible for the testing and storage of the equipment for their constituencies in relation to virtually all of these costs. Some €1.15 million to date has been paid on the voter education and awareness campaign. My Department does not have details of estimated storage costs for the voting machines. Where these costs will arise, these are a matter for returning officers.</p>

            <p eId="para_2798">Landlords are required under the Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations 1996, to register with the local authority private rented accommodation to which the regulations apply and pay a fee of €50 per annum in respect of each registration application. Registration fees are payable to the housing authorities in respect of their functions under sections 17, 18 and 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 relating to rent books, standards and registration of private rented accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2800">The Residential Tenancies Bill 2003, which is currently before Dáil Éireann, provides that landlords must register details of their tenancies with a Private Residential Tenancies Board and provides, accordingly, for the repeal of the 1996 regulations. This board will proactively pursue compliance and unregistered accommodation will also come to notice when tenants bring cases to the board. Landlords must be registered in order to avail of the board's dispute resolution service and a double fee will apply to late registrations. Conviction for an offence under the legislation, including contravention of the registration requirements, will carry a fine of up to €3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both, along with a daily fine, of up to €250 for continuing non-compliance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2803">I propose to take Questions Nos. 385 and 386 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2804">The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993 prescribe minimum physical standards of private rented accommodation, including maintenance of dwellings in good repair, and require common areas, yards, forecourts and items such as walls and fences to be kept in good repair and clean condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_2805">Housing authorities are responsible for enforcing the regulations, including inspection of premises, notifying landlords of necessary improvements and, where appropriate, instituting court proceedings. Conviction for an offence in respect of accommodation standards carries a fine of up to €1,270 and up to €127 for each day of a continuing offence. It is proposed to update these penalties under the Residential Tenancies Bill, which is currently before the Dáil. That Bill also prohibits landlords taking retaliatory action against tenants who make complaints to public authorities. It is proposed, in tandem with the operation of the new legislation, to undertake further action to promote improvement in standards of private rented accommodation, including measures to maximise the effectiveness of enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2806">Where a requirement of the standards regulations is not complied with, the housing authority can have any necessary repairs carried out and recover the cost, which may be secured against the property, from the landlord. Housing authorities also have further powers to require the repair, closure or demolition of houses that are unfit for human habitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2807">The Litter Pollution Act 1997 requires owners of residences let in two or more dwellings to keep areas visible from a public place free of litter. Local authorities are responsible for enforcement of this legislation, which carries a fine of up to €3,000 on conviction for an offence and up to €600 for each day of a continuing offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2808">The registered owner of property, including rented dwellings, can be ascertained from the Land Registry. Complaints relating to the standard or condition of particular properties can be made to the relevant local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2809">Action to deal with anti-social behaviour generally is primarily a matter for the Garda Síochána. The Residential Tenancies Bill prohibits tenants engaging in anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, dwellings to which the Bill applies. It allows landlords to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing others to engage in such behaviour with a notice period of only seven days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour or 28 days in the case of less serious, but persistent, behaviour. The Bill also obliges landlords to enforce tenants' obligations where a person, such as a neighbour, would be adversely affected by a failure to do so. It gives third parties that are affected a right to take a case against a landlord who has failed to enforce a tenant's obligations to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, which will be established under the legislation to deal with disputes in the private rented sector. The board can direct the landlord to ensure that the tenants comply with their obligations and if necessary, enforce compliance through the courts.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2825">The shared ownership scheme is designed to facilitate access to full home ownership in stages by persons who cannot afford this immediately. The applicant initially acquires a share, minimum of 40%, in a house and rents the remainder from the local authority, with an undertaking to acquire the remaining equity within a 25 year period. The applicant's share in the ownership of the house is normally paid for by way of a cash deposit and a local authority mortgage loan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2826">Under these arrangements, loan repayments relate not to the full equity value of the house but only to the amount purchased through the mortgage. Applicants are also expected to take out mortgage protection insurance in respect of their share, which in the event of death, would pay off the associated outstanding mortgage commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2827">In most cases site subsidy does not arise in shared ownership transactions and therefore a clawback does not apply. Where, however, the local authority has originally provided the house at a discount from market value through payment of a site subsidy and the purchaser proposes to purchase the remaining equity from the local authority or sell or dispose of his or her equity in the house within 20 years of the date of the shared ownership lease, the purchaser must refund to the local authority a percentage of the proceeds of the sale of the house, that is, a clawback. The percentage of the proceeds to be repaid will be related to the proportion of discount originally received from the local authority. A full refund must be paid if the house is sold within the first ten years of occupancy. A reduction of 10% per annum is given for each full year of occupancy between ten and 20 years and after 20 years of full occupancy no refund would be due to the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2828">The general terms of the shared ownership scheme, as outlined above, are governed by the 1992 and 2002 Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts. The application of these in individual cases is dealt with through the terms of the particular leasing agreement between the local authority and the householder. Detailed questions regarding individual circumstances under the shared ownership scheme may therefore be appropriately addressed to the local authority.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2830">The National Development Plan 2000-2006 estimated that housing demand would translate into a requirement for an additional 500,000 houses to be built in the ten years to 2010, that is, 50,000 per year. The measures introduced by this Government to boost supply are having effect. The NDP targets are being met with almost 229,000 units built in the four years since 2000. The year 2003 was the ninth successive year of record housing output with house completions at 68,819 units, up 19.3% on the previous year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2831">Last year also saw a 14% increase in house completions in Dublin, to 14,394 units, and an increase of 10.5% in the greater Dublin area, to 22,852 units.</p>
            <p eId="para_2832">The Government is committed to continuing with measures to boost the supply of housing and ensuring that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner. The Government is also concerned to ensure that the broad spectrum of housing needs is met, and remains committed to continuing with measures to assist low-income groups and those with social housing needs by means of a range of targeted social and affordable housing programmes. There has been substantial growth in investment in housing. The capital spending provision in 2004 at over €1.8 billion is four times the level of investment in 1997. It is anticipated that the housing needs of around 13,000 households will be met in 2004 through the full range of social and affordable housing measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2833">Local authorities, including those in Dublin, have been asked to develop new five-year action plans to deliver across the full range of social and affordable housing programmes and supporting measures for the period 2004 to 2008. The action plans will be based on the overall analysis of need and should be consistent with the relevant housing strategy, subject to any necessary updating. The plans will outline the proposed response in terms of new social and affordable housing, Traveller accommodation, and the housing needs of the elderly, people with a disability and the homeless. They will also address regeneration and remedial works together with the proposed arrangements for management and maintenance of the local authority housing stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_2834">The plans are to be submitted to my Department by the end of this month and will be agreed later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2847">Decisions on the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts moneys are currently a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. The board has engaged Area Development Management Limited to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf which involves the disbursement of up to €30 million from the fund.

            <p eId="para_2871">Given that my Department provides a fully bilingual service across a wide range of the services its provides to the general public, it is not expected that significant additional costs will arise in the implementation of the Act within the Department. A number of the public bodies for which the Department has responsibility, such as Údarás na Gaeltachta and Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge, for example, already provide all services through the Irish language and the Act should have no cost implications for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2872">As the Deputy is aware, the Act provides for the preparation by my Department, and individually by each of the bodies under its aegis, of a scheme on the delivery of services to the general public in the Irish language. My Department is finalising the drafting of its scheme under the Act and is preparing guidelines to assist other public bodies in preparing their schemes. It is anticipated that the scheme and the guidelines will finalised in the near future. The first tranche of other public bodies will be asked to prepare schemes for approval once the draft guidelines have gone through the necessary statutory consultation procedure. The Department's draft scheme has yet to be finalised and those other public bodies under the Department's aegis for which the Act has service delivery implications, such as ADM and the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, have to prepare schemes. Estimates of the costs involved are not available but it is envisaged that they will not be substantial. The costs that arise will be met from within the framework of existing administrative budgets.</p>

            <p eId="para_2878">Since 1 May 2004, applicants for a range of social assistance payments have had to satisfy the condition of being habitually resident in Ireland. The purpose of the HRC1 form is to enable persons making a claim for social assistance payments to outline the circumstances of their residency. This allows the Department to make a decision in their case. The person in question claimed unemployment assistance on 4 May 2004. He was asked to complete the HRC1 form so his entitlement for payment could be determined. Other conditions for the receipt of this payment include being available for and genuinely seeking work, as well as satisfying a means test. His application is under consideration and he will be advised of the outcome immediately after a decision is made.</p>

            <p eId="para_2880">Subject to certain conditions, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs and who do not have accommodation available from any other source. The North Eastern Health Board, which was contacted about this case, has advised that an application for rent supplement from the person in question was refused because her means exceeded the relevant income limit. The board has further advised that it needs to be satisfied that the person has explored other possible solutions to address her difficulties and that no other more appropriate options remain open to her. The person is expected to pursue the possibility of obtaining a barring order to secure the family home for occupation solely by herself and her child. This could provide a better long-term outcome for the family in question. The circumstances of the case as they have been presented to the board do not justify, in the opinion of the board, the payment of rent supplement. The person has been advised of her right to appeal against the decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_2882">Recruitment of all persons, including persons with disabilities, in the main Civil Service grades is the statutory responsibility of the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. The commission uses two competition methods to recruit persons with disabilities; the standard open competitions and confined competitions held specifically for persons with disabilities. The entry requirements and the standard necessary to pass the confined competitions are identical to those pertaining to the open competitions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2883">My Department is directly responsible for recruitment at the services grade level. Recruitment for these grades is conducted by means of advertisement with FÁS. Persons with disabilities are encouraged to apply for the positions. My Department also engages in some direct recruitment of temporary staff outside Dublin to cover short-term absences such as the summer term time period or maternity leave. As is the case with all appointments to the Civil Service, the appointments are subject to the person's being suitable for the duties of the position being filled. As part of my Department's commitment to staff with disabilities, a group was established in 2003 under its workplace partnership process to examine issues relating to the needs of staff with disabilities and to make recommendations about appropriate changes and improvements. The group recently produced its report and its recommendations, including some relating to aspects of recruitment, are being examined.</p>

The case has been referred to an investigative officer of my Department for a means assessment and to establish if the conditions necessary for receipt of carer's allowance are satisfied. In the meantime, the medical evidence in support of his application has been forwarded to the Department's chief medical advisor for consideration of medical eligibility. His entitlement to carer's allowance will be further considered in light of the reports of the medical adviser and the investigative officer. He will be notified directly of the outcome. Under social welfare legislation, decisions about claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. The officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_2934">Deserted wife's benefit is a payment made to a woman deserted by her husband. Entitlement to payment is based on social insurance contributions paid by the wife or her husband. An earnings limit was introduced for deserted wife's benefit in 1992. The limit, which applied only to new claims after August 1992, is currently €12, 697.38 a year, in terms of gross earnings. Where earnings are in excess of that figure, there may be entitlement to a reduced rate of payment of deserted wife's benefit, provided earnings do not exceed €17,776.33 a year in gross earnings. A no earnings limit applies where the claim was made on or before 30 August 1992.</p>
            <p eId="para_2935">A further change was introduced in 1997 when the scheme was closed to new applications with effect from 2 January 1997, on the introduction of the one-parent family payment. With the introduction of that scheme, the condition of desertion no longer applied. A parent with dependent children is eligible for benefits under the scheme, irrespective of gender or the circumstances that gave rise to the lone parenthood. Lone parents are encouraged under the scheme to maximise their income from different sources and the means test for the scheme makes provision for the exemption of earnings and maintenance payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2936">With regard to employment, lone parents may earn up to €146.50 per week without affecting their payment. Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50%, up to a maximum of €293.00 per week. Lone parents are also eligible to avail of the full range of employment support schemes operated by my Department. The schemes for deserted wives under social insurance have been retained to the extent that existing entitlements already acquired in August 1992, when the earnings limit was introduced for new claimants, and in 1997, when the one parent family payment scheme was introduced have been preserved. All new claimants, irrespective of gender, who seek income support as lone parents, are treated equally.</p>

            <p eId="para_2944">The back to work allowance scheme consists of two strands. These are the back to work enterprise allowance for people going into self employment and the back to work allowance for employees. Information on the type of employment or self employment of back to work allowance scheme participants is not recorded on the computer systems through which back to work allowance payments are made. However, evaluations of the scheme carried out by independent consultants indicate that about 13% of back to work enterprise allowance participants are engaged in the carriage of goods and people. This category includes taxi/hackney drivers and couriers. There are currently 8,451 participants in the self employed strand of the scheme and a further 6,011 participants in the employee strand. These data suggest that there are approximately 1,000 participants in the self-employment strand of the scheme engaged in the carriage of goods and people, including participants in the taxi industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_2945">No record is kept of the numbers of taxi drivers who surrender their licences on completion of the allowance. However, the numbers involved are likely to be small, in that experience has shown that the great majority of enterprises supported through the scheme are successful. Evaluations of the scheme indicate that almost 80% of participants in the back to work</p>
            <p eId="para_2946">enterprise allowance remained in business or in other forms of employment when their participation in the scheme had ended.</p>
            <p eId="para_2947">Applications for the self employed strand of the scheme must be approved by either the Department's locally based facilitators, or, in partnership areas, by the enterprise officer. In all cases the facilitator or enterprise officer must be satisfied that the business will survive beyond the four years during which the allowance is payable. The back to work scheme is kept under regular review to ensure it retains its focus in assisting the long term unemployed and other vulnerable groups into sustainable employment or self employment while also ensuring that participants do not displace enterprises already in existence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2948">The question of displacement is specifically considered before claims are approved. As both the facilitator and enterprise officer are familiar with supply and demand for services in their area, they are best placed to decide if displacement will occur. If this is the case the enterprise will not be approved and the allowance is not awarded. This applies to all businesses including the taxi business.</p>

            <p eId="para_2955">My Department recognises the rights of customers to be dealt with in Irish if they so wish and makes every effort to ensure that service through Irish is available and of a high standard. The policy in relation to the use of Irish is informed by the principles of quality customer service which were adopted by the Government in 2000, the Department's statement of strategy 2003-2005 and customer action plans since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_2956">It is not possible to quantify the precise amount of money spent specifically on Irish in any given year, whether arising from the requirements of the Official Languages Act or otherwise. Providing services to customers through Irish involves translation and printing of forms and leaflets, training of staff in written and spoken Irish, and providing public area signage with both directions and information on the availability of service through Irish. The cost of the Irish element is, in many instances, included in the total cost and cannot be separately identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_2957">The Official Languages Act provides for preparation in due course by my Department, and individually by each by the bodies under its aegis, of a scheme in relation to the delivery of services to the public in the Irish language. It is not possible at this stage to specify what services through Irish will be provided for in the scheme. The Department will be assessing costs as part of the process of preparing for the delivery of services through Irish.</p>
            <p eId="para_2958">A similar situation pertains to the four statutory agencies under the aegis of my Department — Combat Poverty Agency, Comhairle, the Pensions Board and the Family Support Agency.</p>
