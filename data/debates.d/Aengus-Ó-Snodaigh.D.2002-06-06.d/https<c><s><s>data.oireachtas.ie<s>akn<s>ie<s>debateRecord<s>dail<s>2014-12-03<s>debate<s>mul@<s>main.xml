            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Michael McGrath</b> asked the <b>Minister for Finance</b> his plans for the future of the State's ownership of AIB; the reason for his recent comments in relation to the price of AIB shares; his plans to dispose of a stake in the bank in 2015; how the proceeds of any such sale would be used; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2">The purpose of my first question is to establish the Minister's intentions regarding the State's ownership of AIB in view of the appointment of a panel of professional advisers to assist in the possible sale of a stake in the bank and the Minister's recent comments about the share price. I am hoping the Minister will give some clarity on his intentions in the short and medium term regarding our holding at AIB.##</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">AIB's return to profitability is good news from the perspective of the Irish taxpayer, as it enhances the value of the bank for the taxpayer. The last valuation of our AIB shares, which was carried out by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, NPRFC, at the end of 2013, valued the State's ordinary and preference shareholding at €10 billion. Including the contingent convertible capital notes, or CoCos, that we hold, this brings the value of the State's shareholding to €11.6 billion. Since then, bank stocks in many eurozone countries have performed well, and with AIB itself performing strongly I would be confident that the current value of AIB is greater than the NPRFC valuation at the end of 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> Now that the bank has returned to profit, is on a stable path and has passed the ECB's comprehensive assessment, my officials will engage with the management team to explore how we can reconfigure the bank's capital structure to make it fit for purpose. The regulatory rules and expectations have changed dramatically in the past couple of years and we need to lay out a plan to position the bank for this new environment. As part of this process we hope to agree a roadmap that will see the bank start to return cash to the State so that we can begin the process of repaying the taxpayer's large investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> With respect to the State's shareholdings or ownership in the banks, Government policy remains unchanged - namely, that we do not wish to hold these investments in the banks over the long term. Subject to market conditions, therefore, we are willing to exit in a manner that maximises value for the taxpayer. In the last 18 months the State has exited successfully from some debt investments with the sale of our CoCos and preference shares in Bank of Ireland, in addition to the sale of Irish Life. Given the significant cash resources we hold, we are not under any immediate pressure to exit our remaining investments. However, given where our national debt is, neither do we have the luxury of holding on indefinitely.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> We are not making any decisions with regard to reducing our ownership in the bank now, because, as I have just outlined, we have important decisions to make about how we should best reconfigure our existing investments in a way that benefits both the bank and the taxpayer. That is our main priority in the coming months. If we can deliver on this work programme next year and everything else develops as we would like, then we may be at a point at which we can consider selling some of our shares.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_7">I thank the Minister for his reply. Does the Minister believe that the State will recoup all of the €20.8 billion that was injected into AIB? He has just said that he believes the current valuation of AIB is in excess of the €11.6 billion figure that the NPRFC put on the bank at the end of 2013. When I quizzed the CEO of AIB, Mr. David Duffy, at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, he expressed the belief that within a ten-year period all of the money should be repaid to the State. I would like to hear the Minister's views on that issue. My view on the State's shareholding is that while I would not necessarily be opposed to selling a minority stake in the bank, I believe there is real long-term value for the State in holding at least some equity interest in AIB. It is a recovering bank in a recovering economy and is making significant progress. The best prospect for the State in terms of recouping all the money is to at least retain a significant shareholding in the bank for a number of years. I would welcome the Minister's views on that issue.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_8">I have given the values as estimated by independent valuers. Since the valuations were made at the end of 2013, the bank's position has improved in terms of both profit and market share. Things are going quite well for AIB. It is hard to say exactly what it is worth, but I believe, as does the CEO of the bank, that taxpayers will get all their money back in due course, although it is difficult to say over what period of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> No firm decisions have been made about the sale of AIB or a minority shareholding in AIB. We will do the preparatory work first, and then there may be a possibility of a sale towards the back end of 2015 or in the course of 2016. We do not have an agreed timeframe for that. We will appoint an adviser, take the advice, reconfigure the bank's shares and move on then. There are issues such as the preference shares and CoCos that must be dealt with, as well as the normal equity. There is a series of issues on which we need to take advice and to make decisions, but we are not rushing it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_10">I am glad to hear that the Minister is not rushing it, because there is no need to rush it. The State came to AIB's rescue in its hour of need and injected an absolutely colossal amount of money to save the bank - almost €21 billion. People will be glad to hear that over time, albeit an indefinite amount of time, the State will recoup all of that money; the sooner the better, of course, for the sake of taxpayers and our national debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> If a decision is made to sell some of the State's stake in AIB on the open market, to what use would the proceeds be put in terms of coming into the central Exchequer?</p>
            <p eId="para_12">Would they be used to pay down debt, improve the State's capacity to invest in employment initiatives and so forth? The Minister indicated he is preparing the ground for a possible sale of some of the bank next year and given that he believes it is worth in excess of €11.5 billion at this stage, a 20% or 30% stake sale could raise significant moneys for the State. I appreciate it is early days yet but to what use would such moneys be put?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">It is the intention of the Government and there is a Government decision that it would be used to pay down debt but if it goes to 2016 it will be for the Government in 2016, whoever composes it, to make the decisions. We are doing the preparatory work now. We have a valuation on the bank but the real valuation will be after some shares are sold. If, for example, the State was to sell 25% of it, we would have market valuation on the other 75%, so we would be in a better position. Once there is a market value, we would not be relying on estimates any longer.</p>

            <p eId="para_14">2. <b>Deputy Pearse Doherty</b> asked the <b>Minister for Finance</b> if junior bondholders who refused to share in Anglo Irish Bank's losses are likely to receive payments as a result of the liquidation process at Irish Bank Resolution Corporation. [46338/14]</p>

            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">The liquidation process of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, the former Anglo Irish Bank, and Irish Nationwide Building Society, is ongoing. It has been reported recently by Joe Brennan in Bloomberg that once more bondholders may get paid around the same time as water bills will drop through the letterboxes of families across this State. Can the Minister reassure us that it is unlikely that junior bondholders in the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society will be paid from the liquidation, that any surplus assets from the liquidation process will come to the Irish State and therefore the Irish people and will he outline his expectation in this regard when the matter comes to a conclusion?</p>

            <p eId="para_16">The special liquidators continue to implement the orderly and efficient wind down of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited (in Special Liquidation) in accordance with the provisions of the IBRC Act and the instructions issued by me under the IBRC Act 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> In April 2014, the special liquidators announced that the loan sales process had concluded. The sales process of the IBRC loan assets, including their segmentation to meet demand from international buyers, delivered a very positive result with over 90% of the loan assets - with a par value of €21.7 billion - sold.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> Following instructions from myself as Minister for Finance, NAMA was no longer obliged to purchase the unsold IBRC assets at their independent valuation as previously envisaged, as the expected proceeds to be raised from the sale of the IBRC loan assets will be sufficient to fully repay the IBRC debt to NAMA. The special liquidators have therefore devised a further sales process in respect of the unsold loan assets so as to maximise the return to all remaining creditors of IBRC, including the State. This sales process is currently under way and the special liquidators are unable to quantify at this stage the total sales proceeds that will be achieved from this process. </p>
            <p eId="para_19"> In tandem with the further sales process, the special liquidators have published advertisements and written to those known creditors in order to finalise their claims in the liquidation. Creditors in the UK and Ireland have until 31 March 2015 to submit their claims and those creditors in the US have until 31 May 2015. Once all claims have been submitted, they will be reviewed in detail and adjudicated on by the special liquidators. In order to finalise this process, further information may be sought from some creditors in order to validate their claims. Should the junior bondholders submit a claim and it is found to be valid then they will be legally entitled to a dividend provided there are sufficient funds available for distribution. The special liquidators are unable to comment at this stage on the level of dividends that each creditor will be entitled to until such time as the sales processes are completed and the total level of adjudicated creditors is finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_20">We should always remind ourselves that we are talking about €35 billion that was injected into both the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, which now form IBRC, which crippled the State. One of the Minister's first actions on taking office in 2011 was to pay over the promissory note of €3.1 billion that was due on 31 March. Then we had the winding down of the bank but not the winding down of the debt. When the bank was placed into liquidation on that special night here that was called "prom night", it was stated in the Department of Finance briefing - I have that presentation and it was all very rushed - to finance spokespersons in February 2013, under the heading "Transaction Costs &amp; Unsecured Creditor impacts", that: "It is not expected that any assets will be available to repay subordinate liability holders". Despite the fact that I did not agree to what happened that night because the debt still remains and is just stretched out, has the position changed in terms of that sentence? Is it still not expected that any assets will be available to repay the subordinate liability holders? There is a genuine fear as a result of what we have seen from Bloomberg that seven years on from the banking crisis the Deputy will be the Minister for Finance who will oversee the repayment to unsecured junior bondholders in the former Anglo Irish Bank who will receive millions of euro despite the fact the State has injected €35 billion into this bank and is also a creditor of it. Will the Minister outline the position the State takes in terms of the €1.1 billion due to it from the assets of the IBRC?</p>

            <p eId="para_21">In the course of 2010 and 2011 a number of liability management exercises were conducted by the covered banks for the purpose of generating additional core tier 1 capital and to strengthen the quality of the capital base of the banks. Since this Government came into power the cash required for the recapitalisation of the banks was reduced by €5.8 billion through burden sharing with subordinate bondholders. The contribution from burden sharing with bondholders of this type amounts to approximately €15 billion since the banking crisis with almost €3.7 billion of that number coming from IBRC alone. That said, despite the significant efforts taken over the course of 2010 and 2011, there was a number of subordinate bonds with a nominal value of €280 million that continued to remain outstanding at the time of the liquidation of the IBRC in February 2013. These bonds remained outstanding both as a result of a refusal by investors to participate in IBRC's liability management exercise in 2010, that is to take a voluntary loss, and also as a result of an unfavourable English High Court ruling against the bank in July 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">There is an important sentence here if I could read it. It is important to note that it remains to be seen if there will be proceeds available for the repayment of these creditors as they rank behind both preferred and senior unsecured creditors in priority. Unsecured creditors will get paid if there is money but there is a ranking order and it is not clear yet whether the €280 million worth of junior bondholders will pursue their claim as creditors, whether they can validate their position as creditors and, if so, if there will be any money left over when all other unsecured creditors are paid in full.</p>

            <p eId="para_24">The question before the Minister is quite simple. I appreciate that we still do not know what amount will remain when the entire IBRC is liquidated. However, that briefing provided to finance spokespersons contained the statement that: "It is not expected that any assets will be available to repay subordinate liability holders". Does the Minister stand over that statement? I take from what he said here today that this may not be the case and it is likely that subordinate bondholders in the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society could be paid from the assets of the liquidation. That is very different from what was stated clearly and is down in black and white in this statement, that "It is not expected that any will be available".</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> With regard to the €1.1 billion the State is owed from IBRC, and this is in regard to the repayment of the senior bondholders who were covered under the guarantee in respect of the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, where does that fall in regard to the line of creditors who are now lining up? Is the Minister anticipating any payment or recoupment of that money to the State as a creditor of IBRC? The fact that we have lost that €35 billion is one of the great shames but there is still a possibility within the liquidation process that we will recoup a substantial amount of money and where does the State rank in terms of the line of creditors?</p>

            <p eId="para_26">The sentence the Deputy quoted was the expectation at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">The expectation at the start of the liquidation process was that we would be fortunate if the liquidation of IBRC covered the secured creditors. It transpired that the liquidation had gone better than expected, resulting in a surplus, which surplus will now be used to cover some of the unsecured creditors. As the State represents 70% of the unsecured creditors, this means that there will be money available for it. There are other complications, including many legal cases, and I am sure the Deputy is aware of one of the bigger ones. The liquidator in prudence must set money aside, rather than distribute to unsecured creditors to cover legal liabilities or damages that might occur. The position is unclear. The liquidator is advertising for any person who believes he or she is an unsecured creditor to make a claim which he or she will have to validate. As preferred and senior unsecured creditors have a priority over junior bondholders, it is not clear whether there will be any money left. The expectation when the question was previously answered was that there would not be any additional money for unsecured creditors. That was the view at the time.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">Very often when some of us on this side of the House rail against unfair water charges, property taxes or what we believe is the Government's failure to adequately fund public services such as housing, health and education, the Minister regularly cites the phrase "there is no pot of gold" in terms of there being an alternative source of funds that could be taxed to avoid this unfairness and give us the resources we need to invest in public services. The Credit Suisse report suggests there is a large pot of gold in the hands of a tiny group of people. I would like to know if the Minister has seen the report and, if so, his views on it and whether he believes it indicates the need for a wealth tax.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_30">The Credit Suisse global wealth report 2014 provides a broad range of data in the area of global household wealth and its composition and distribution in the period 2000 to 2014 for over 200 individual countries.  The authors of the report acknowledge that the study of global household wealth is still at an early stage of development and that no country has completely reliable information on personal wealth. This obliged them to assemble and process information from a variety of sources.  The authors state much work remains to be done to refine estimates of wealth by country and improve the estimates of wealth distribution within countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> I note that the report indicates that Ireland lies in the group of developed economies where the top decile or the wealthiest 10% of adults share greater than 50% of the wealth. This places Ireland towards the lower end of the wealth inequality index in the developed world. As I have stated on a number of occasions, wealth can be taxed in a variety of ways, some of which are in place in Ireland.  Capital gains tax, CGT, and capital acquisitions tax, CAT, are, in effect, taxes on wealth, in that they are levied on an individual or a company on the disposal of an asset or the acquisition of an asset through a gift or an inheritance. Deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, is charged at 41%, with limited exemptions, on interest earned on deposit accounts.  The local property tax, LPT, introduced in 2013 is a tax based on the market value of residential properties.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> To estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax, it would first be necessary to identify the wealth held by individuals.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they currently have no statistical basis for compiling estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax. Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to Revenue in a number of specific circumstances, for example, after a death, this information is not a complete measure of financial assets in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> I am advised that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, institutional sector accounts do not give an indication of the number of households or persons classified by the categories of wealth they hold.  These statistics are based on aggregate information collected from financial institutions and do not contain the demographic details which would enable such a breakdown of the statistics to be given.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">When the Government wants to impose a property tax or force people to pay unjust water charges or the Department of Social Protection wants to means-test them, it is possible to put in place an invasive process to find out the value of people's property and so on, yet when it comes to finding out about the personal wealth of the super rich, we are told the process of compiling accurate information in that regard would be very complicated and difficult. That is not acceptable. We should find that accurate information. If the Credit Suisse report is even 50% right, it is shocking that the top 5% of people in this country hold 40% of the wealth, which amounts to just under €250 billion. Even a 0.5% tax on that amount could provide an alternative to unfair water charges, property taxes and other austerity measures. There are 88,000 millionaires, including 5,000 who have between €5 million and €10 million and 3,000 who have between €10 million and €50 million. This is extraordinary wealth, yet we are being told the imposition of a wealth tax would be too complicated a process.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">Socialists all over the world are in favour of property taxes. There is, therefore, a contradiction in the Deputy's position.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> Following a discussion between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Central Statistics Office and the Central Bank, the Central Statistics Office undertook a household finance and consumption survey, HFCS, to obtain information on household wealth. The results of the survey are expected to be available in early 2015. The main aim of the HFCS is to provide structural information on household assets and liabilities based on a representative sample of households. This will address gaps in knowledge about the economic well-being of households, the distribution and type of wealth and liabilities among households and individuals, as well as factors that affect financial planning for households and individuals. The data collected by the CSO as part of its household finance and consumption survey are not being collected for the purposes of calculating the potential yield from a wealth tax but to collect general information on the financial position and behaviour of households. The Government has no plans to introduce a wealth tax, although all taxes and potential taxes are, of course, constantly reviewed. There is work in progress that will provide the data about which the Deputy speaks.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">In terms of a tax on the family home and a tax on wealth - in other words, people who have multiple homes or commercial investment property and large cash reserves and other financial assets - it would not be that difficult to work out the difference between the two. The Central Bank's view is that wealth is half financial and half asset related. For 90% of the population, a significant amount of their wealth would be accounted for by their house, if they had one. On the 5% of the population who hold 40% of the wealth, it is fair to assume that the vast bulk of this wealth which amounts to €250 billion is not accounted for by their family homes. Most of it is multiple property assets that are revenue producing and financial assets, shares and so on. A distinction, in terms of a wealth tax, must be made between the family home in which people need to live and revenue producing commercial property and other assets which are generating, on average, profits of 3%, 4% or 5% per annum. Even a 1% tax on this wealth would not impact on those involved. They would still be super rich, but we would have a lot of revenue to offer alternatives to unfair water charges and property taxes.</p>

            <p eId="para_40">The Deputy is correct that a lot of wealth in Ireland is represented by family homes. However, very often there is no strong connection between the asset value of a family home and the income of the people in the household. Once one passes Newlands Cross a lot of the wealth in the country is represented by farm land. While a person with 100 acres of land worth approximately €10,000 an acre would have an asset worth € 1 million, that is the asset value. The income stream for the person concerned, in particular if involved in dry stock or beef production, would be low. Also, as the asset passes from generation to generation, to deem people like that to be extraordinarily wealthy-----</p>

That leads me to the next question of whether it is still the Minister's intention to change the pay and file date in the future. We do not want to have a constant threat hanging over the sector, which is vital to the economy, that the pay and file date may change. The press release issued last year indicated that there would be no change in 2014, but it made clear that the Minister's intention was still to bring forward the date. The Minister has now rolled on the process for another year and indicated that this will not happen in 2015. Is it still his underlying intention to change the date, as it is important for us to have clarity in that regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_48">The purpose of the proposed change was purely pragmatic; it was to ensure budget estimates could be forecasted accurately. Once the budget date was moved from the first week of December to the middle of October, it gave rise to a difficulty in forecasting. In 2014 the departmental forecasts have been very accurate and this remains true for 2015. There were no data to predict the November figure, but, as published yesterday, the profile was exceeded by approximately €38 million. When we are considering a sum of €6.2 billion, coming within €38 million of the amount brought in is indicative of very accurate forecasting. I do not now see the necessity, for budgetary reasons, to bring the dates forward. I do not expect any change in the life of this Parliament. What future Ministers will decide will be up to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">I thank the Minister for providing clarity. The experience in the past 12 months or so bears out the point that we and many others raised at the time that the income stream from self-employed returns was in the region of €1 billion. Even if the estimate was out by 15%, the difference would be €150 million. In the overall context, such a sum would be somewhat immaterial and not have justified the massive inconvenience that would have been caused by changing the pay and file arrangements. There would have been cash-flow issues for businesses and consequences for professional advisers, who are responsible for putting together and filing returns. It would have brought the process back to the summer season and August, the normal time for examinations and study leave, as well as holidays and so forth. As that would have caused problems, I am glad that the Minister has committed to not making a change in the lifetime of the Government. It is a welcome clarification and the sector will appreciate it. As the Minister indicated, it will be a matter for future Ministers to decide on future policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">I am aware of the price changes that have taken place in the residential property and private rental markets. Nationally, residential property prices rose by 16% in the 12 months to October 2014 according to the Central Statistics Office. The most recent <i>daft.ie</i> national rental index indicates that rents nationally were 10.8% higher on average in the third quarter of 2014 than a year previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> The Government's view is that the impetus for recent price and rent developments comes from a shortage of supply, particularly in Dublin and, to some extent, in the other major cities. As part of economic recovery, there is an increased level of housing demand, particularly as a result of the growth in the number of people at work. However, thus far, supply has not responded adequately to match demand, leading to increased prices and rents. The Deputy will be aware that Construction 2020: A Strategy for A Renewed Construction Sector sets out the Government's strategy to address these issues and remove blockages from the system in order to get the market moving and increase supply. Some 75 time-bound actions are included in the strategy. My Department is party to a range of actions which, among other issues, focus on appropriate and sustainable development financing, transparent and sustainable mortgage lending, the application of the tax code to the construction and property sectors and addressing legacy issues associated with the property bubble.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> I have introduced a number of targeted initiatives in various budgets since 2011 to aid in revitalising the property and construction sectors and help to increase the supply of suitable residential housing stock in certain urban areas where supply limitations are most pronounced. The Finance Act 2013 introduced the real estate investment trust, REIT, tax regime. The acquisition of properties by REITs is part of a broader effort to have a more sustainable, professionalised, long-term property rental market for the benefit of both investors and tenants. More recently, as part of budget 2014, I introduced a number of measures, including, subject to state aid approval, the extension of the living city initiative to include Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin and the broadening of eligibility criteria to include all buildings built prior to 1915.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_56">In the budget I extended the home renovation incentive to rental properties whose owners were liable to income tax. In the coming months I will launch a public consultation process to examine if owners of zoned and serviced land are hoarding land and delaying development. I have also signalled that the capital gains tax exemption introduced at the bottom of the market will be discontinued from January.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> Access to development finance is a key issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the proper functioning of the property market. It is clear from work undertaken by my Department that the funding model for development is fundamentally changed from the previous mainly debt-based model, with more equity now needed.  In this context, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, under the auspices of the NTMA, is exploring ways, through its commercial mandate, to support financing projects that will enhance the supply of housing. In addition, NAMA has stated it expects to fund the delivery of 4,500 houses and apartments to serve the greater Dublin area in the period from 2014 to the end of 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> There are encouraging signals to indicate that policies introduced by the Government are having an effect. In particular, there has been a large increase in housing commencements in the first half of 2014, while applications for planning permission have exceeded 2013 figures each month and are up by almost 20%. Increases in housing supply should lead to a moderation of price and rent rises in the property market, in turn improving access to affordable accommodation. In addition to the measures I have outlined, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, has recently published the Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform which sets out to address issues of social housing provision, as well as accessibility and affordability. The strategy proposes to provide 35,000 social housing units in the next six years through a combination of construction and acquisition and to meet the housing needs of up to 75,000 households.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> On the Deputy's question around the increasing concentration of property ownership, historically the private rented sector has been characterised by small-scale landlords. Attracting large-scale investment in professionally managed residential property, for example, using REITs and other options for long-term investment, can have an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high standard sector tenants deserve. As part of Construction 2020, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, with the housing agency, is developing a national policy towards professionalising the private rental sector, to include issues such as investment, standards and regulation.  A key element of their research is to assess the policy treatment of the sector, with a view to making recommendations to encourage more and larger scale investment in order to increase the supply of good quality, secure and affordable rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> In summary, my Department continues to monitor developments in both the purchase and rental property markets. In line with the Construction 2020 strategy, the Government will continue to work on addressing remaining challenges in the property and construction sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">There is a rapidly spiralling housing and homelessness crisis. A major proportion of the income of ordinary people is going towards keeping a roof over their head, which is adequate proof that the Government's policy in this regard has failed dramatically and that radical action is required. Construction 2020 and other pie in the sky projects will not cut it any more. People just cannot afford to put a roof over their head. This is because the process has been left to the market and the Government made a critical decision to allow NAMA and other bailed-out financial institutions with property portfolios and so on to flog them to big corporate investors who do not give a damn about affordability; they only care about how much money they can make. The State should intervene in the market; it should control rents, take back some property and charge affordable prices, instead of charging on the basis of making a profit, as the people involved in the market are doing. If we do not do this, the issue will get out of control. As the National Competitiveness Council has indicated, workers will be forced to go on strike in order to have their pay keep pace with accommodation costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">Although rents have risen rapidly throughout the country and particularly in Dublin in the past 12 months, they are still not where they were a couple of years ago. There was a collapse in the rental market similar to the collapse of housing values. As the economy is being restored, rents are going up again, although they are still not back where they were a couple of years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> There is not a shred of evidence to support the Deputy's theory that rising rents are connected to NAMA's policy of selling assets, which it is required to do. The problem is there is a lack of supply which sometimes is connected to regulation. One of the issues to which one can point is the regulation introduced some years ago that all apartments or flats should have en-suite facilities. This compares to the bedsit arrangements where there was a bathroom in the corridor that served two or three bedsits. That took 5,000 bedsits out of commission as they could no longer be rented.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">That is why I extended the home extension scheme to landlords. I am allowing them to restore bedsits that are out of commission by carrying out the work needed to provide en-suite facilities, thereby enabling them to abide by the regulation. It is a supply side problem. When an economy that had been sinking begins to rise, it is very difficult to switch on construction, but it is now happening extensively around Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I accept that there is a supply problem. We should immediately use €4 billion of NAMA's cash reserves to start a massive public works programme involving the construction of affordable housing. It is not that NAMA is creating this problem but that it has no interest in solving it. More to the point, the people to whom NAMA sells these assets have no interest in the problem. I am not making a moral judgment; I am simply making a statement of fact. Big corporate investors in property do not give a damn about affordability or the housing and homelessness crisis. The Minister's job is to give a damn about these things. They will charge market rents or what they can get, even if it makes property unaffordable for significant numbers of people. Those who increasingly control the private rented sector and the property sector do not give a damn about whether ordinary people on low and middle incomes can afford property. As long as they can rent stuff to the people who can afford it, they will make money. The Minister's job is to make sure housing is affordable. That is basic. The economy cannot function if substantial numbers of people in the economy cannot put a roof over their heads. That is elementary. The State has failed to intervene by taking control of rents, prices and enough property to make sure rents and prices are kept down.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">As I said, there is no evidence to support the theories the Deputy is propounding. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, made a major announcement last week on housing, including social housing. He set out a number of initiatives, which are fully funded by the Government's decision, to deal with this problem. It is a very progressive and far-seeing programme and NAMA is playing its part. The Deputy will have noted that there was a big residential element to yesterday's announcement of the development of Boland's Mill, although I accept that the emphasis is on commercial offices. NAMA is working through its client developers to supply houses and apartments in Dublin. My contention that supply is coming back is supported by a survey conducted by one of the specialists in this area, as published in yesterday's newspapers, which found that there had been 370 multiple starts - groups of houses or apartments - to date in 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">7. <b>Deputy Pearse Doherty</b> asked the <b>Minister for Finance</b> the numbers of times State-backed banks have vetoed proposals in the personal insolvency process in cases in which they were the majority creditor.  [45944/14]</p>

            <p eId="para_71">In recent exchanges with the banks at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform a very stubborn approach to struggling families has been taken, particularly by Bank of Ireland. Its approach has become clear once more. Mr. Boucher of Bank of Ireland has claimed he is not aware of a single case in which his bank wrote down mortgage debt. He has suggested the bank has voted in favour of personal insolvency arrangements in 45 cases. The committee asked him to supply information on whether any of these cases involved the write-down of mortgage debt. Two weeks later we are still awaiting the information. It is clear that Bank of Ireland has a policy of not supporting any personal insolvency arrangement that involves a write-down of mortgage debt. The Taoiseach said in the House two weeks ago that "there is, as yet, no definitive evidence of banks vetoing proposals." To what degree are the banks playing ball with the legislation introduced by these Houses?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_72">The information I am giving the House has been provided by the particular institutions. So far this year, AIB has been the controlling voter in 78 cases of personal insolvency process proposals. It voted in favour of the proposal in 51 of the 62 personal insolvency arrangement cases and against it in the other 11. AIB voted in favour of the proposal in all 16 debt settlement arrangement cases. When representatives of AIB appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in October, they noted that the bank exercised its veto only if too much of a dividend was going out to unsecured debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> When representatives of Bank of Ireland appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in October, they confirmed that the bank had voted in favour of personal insolvency arrangements in 45 cases, or 76% of all such cases, in which it was a participant in the 12 months since the launch of the insolvency service. When representatives of the bank appeared before the joint committee in April, they confirmed that the bank's policy was to veto proposals where secured debt was to be written down.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> Permanent tsb has informed me that since inception of the insolvency service, seven personal insolvency proposals have been vetoed in cases in which it was the majority creditor. It has voted in favour of the proposal in 13 instances in which it was the majority creditor.  With regards to debt settlement arrangements in which permanent tsb held the majority vote, it voted in favour of three and against one.  Permanent tsb has noted that each case is assessed on the basis of its individual merit. I have been informed that the bank generally decides to use its veto because it can offer the customer a long-term sustainable and affordable treatment without the need for a personal insolvency arrangement, or because of financial reasons such as proposed fees or dividends.</p>

            <p eId="para_75">I thank the Minister for giving that information. It is probably an understatement to say the personal insolvency system is clearly not functioning as it was intended to do. Representatives of the Insolvency Service of Ireland are travelling around the State to inform people and try to raise awareness, which is to be welcomed. I am aware that the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 is to be revised soon. I have not seen any indication from the Government that the major flaw in the system, which was identified by Sinn Féin and those who work at the coalface with people who are struggling to pay their mortgages when the personal insolvency legislation was debated here, will be addressed. I refer to the section of the 2012 Act which allows a bank that is a major creditor to veto any proposal made by a personal insolvency practitioner. The problem is that the Minister can bring the banks to water, but he cannot make them drink it. It is clear that Bank of Ireland, in particular, has set its face against the spirit of the legislation. The Minister who owns 15% of Bank of Ireland has confirmed in his reply that it is the policy of the bank to veto personal insolvency arrangements proposed by personal insolvency practitioners "where secured debt is to be written down." As a 15% shareholder in Bank of Ireland, can he say this policy is simply not acceptable and should be reconsidered by the bank? Will he emphasise that the personal insolvency system is intended to deal with both secured and unsecured debt? Will he make it clear that Bank of Ireland should co-operate fully with it?</p>

            <p eId="para_76">While the initial take-up of insolvency solutions has been low, it should be noted that the number of cases in the system has increased to over 850. These cases will be worked through in the coming weeks and months. The fact that the Insolvency Service of Ireland is now in place has acted as a catalyst in encouraging debtors and creditors to reach bilateral deals to address insolvencies. In the absence of bilateral agreements, the new statutory framework mechanism will require all relevant creditors to engage with and respond to insolvency arrangements proposed by debtors. One of the features of the relationship between the Department of Finance and the banks in which we hold shares is that we do not interfere in commercial decisions. As the banks operate in accordance with law, they are entitled to do what they do. I will not interfere with their commercial decisions. There is some tweaking required in the legislation. The regulatory regime has already been changed somewhat in respect of fees, etc. and a review is being conducted. As the Deputy knows, the legislation was principally driven by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Minister for Justice and Equality will introduce proposals in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">The take-up of the personal insolvency arrangements has been pathetic when measured against the expectations this Government had to deal with the mortgage crisis. The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, said that approximately 15,000 applications for debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements would be applied for each year plus a further 3,000 to 4,000 applications for debt relief notices. As the Minister mentioned, there are 850 in the system and at the end of quarter three of this year there were only 1,200 applications in total since the very start. It is not working.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> If other banks took the same approach as Bank of Ireland to veto every proposal that requires a debt write-down of secured mortgage debt it would be dead in the water. Some banks are engaging with the spirit of it but no personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, should put forward a proposal to write down debt with the Bank of Ireland because the bank will veto it.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> The Minister mentioned the need for tweaking but is this core area of the legislation up for tweaking or will he allow the Bank of Ireland and other banks deal with it at their leisure? </p>

            <p eId="para_80">The take-up was slow initially but there was an expectation that there would be a slow start to this new legislation in this jurisdiction. The recent Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, quarterly statistics were published in October and in summary, during quarter three, 61 debt relief notices, 22 debt settlement arrangements and 48 personal insolvency arrangements were approved. In addition, there were 137 bankruptcy adjudications in the third quarter of 2014 following the reduction in the duration of bankruptcy to three years. In the year to the end of the second quarter there were 301 bankruptcy adjudications compared to 58 in the whole of 2003. Steady progress is being made. As the new staff settle in the new legal framework is proving to be quite effective and helpful. Its very existence is giving an impetus to bilateral arrangements between banks and persons in mortgage difficulty. The Department of Justice and Equality is carrying out the review, which will consult with the Department of Finance but as yet I have no clear indication of that.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">The Minister’s budget and particularly its changes in income tax and universal social charge, USC, disproportionately favoured those on a higher income. People on €70,000 or more gained between four and six times more than people on the lowest incomes. I have probably made this point since the budget was announced. How can the Minister possibly justify and stand over this unfair budget, given the staggering levels of child poverty, homelessness and the expressions of anger shown on the streets against water charges by those who cannot pay them?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_83">I thank the Deputy for allowing me the opportunity to once again, answer this question which he also put to me at my previous appearance before the House to answer parliamentary questions. It is simply not true that the income tax and USC changes in the budget disproportionately favour those on higher incomes. However, I do not mind once again explaining our position as it is important that people realise what it is we are trying to achieve here.</p>
            <p eId="para_84"> A fair, efficient and competitive income tax system is essential for economic growth and job creation. I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it as soon as it was prudent to do so. The measures announced in the budget are the first stage of a reform plan, to be undertaken over a number of years, to address this issue, particularly for middle-income earners who have borne the greater share of the cost of the economic downturn.</p>
            <p eId="para_85"> In budget 2015 I announced a reduction in the top rate of income tax from 41% to 40%. I also extended the standard rate band on which income tax is chargeable at the lower 20% rate by €1,000. In addition, I have reduced the two lower rates of USC from 2% and 4% to 1.5% and 3.5%, respectively. Furthermore, I have also increased the threshold before which the 7% rate of USC becomes payable to €17,576, so that those on the minimum wage will now only be liable to a maximum 3.5% rate of USC.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> The budget also provides for the retention of the exemption from the top rates of USC for medical card holders with incomes that do not exceed €60,000. These individuals will now only be liable to pay a USC rate of 3.5%, down from 4%. This reduced rate will also apply to the over 70s, with incomes that do not exceed €60,000, again down from 4%.</p>
            <p eId="para_87"> Ireland already has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the developed world. To preserve that progressivity, the budget also contains USC measures which have the effect of limiting the maximum benefit from this package of tax measures to approximately €14 per week for any individual taxpayer, which means that those with very high incomes will only benefit to the same extent as those with more modest incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_89">While the benefits from the changes introduced in budget 2015 are broadly proportionate to the level of income earned for those on low and middle incomes, the reality is that because of the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system those on lower incomes pay very low levels of tax, particularly when compared to their counterparts in Europe. </p>
            <p eId="para_90"> Currently, a single individual employed on the standard minimum wage of €17,542 per annum pays income tax of €4.01 and USC of €10.51 per week. Furthermore, someone on the standard minimum wage is also exempt from paying pay related social insurance, PRSI. As a result of the changes introduced in budget 2015 the weekly USC charge of €10.51 per week will fall to €7.19 per week. This means the individual's tax bill will be reduced by just over 20%.</p>
            <p eId="para_91"> In contrast a single individual earning €70,000 per annum currently pays €25,531 per annum or €490.98 per week in income tax, USC and PRSI. After budget 2015, this individual's tax bill will be reduced by about 3%. Contrasting these two examples, I cannot agree that the income tax budget measures disproportionately favour those on higher incomes. In fact, the highest proportionate benefit as a percentage of net income from the budget tax changes occurs at an income level of just over €12,000. This is a result of my decision to extend the USC exemption threshold from €10,036 to €12,012, which also has the effect of removing 80,000 low earning individuals from the charge entirely.</p>
            <p eId="para_92"> The changes announced in the budget will ensure that all those currently paying income tax and-or USC will see a reduction in their tax bill in 2015. I propose to continue this reform in future budgets, subject to the required economic growth and the consequent fiscal space available to the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_93">According to Social Justice Ireland, an unemployed couple got €1.51 a week or €78.52 a year back in the budget while a couple with two earners on €125,000 will receive an extra €23.57 a week or €1,255 a year. A couple on €125,000 each, very wealthy and comfortable, got 12 times more in the budget than somebody on the lowest income. How can the Minister say that is fair? One can argue on some sort of technical grounds that we have a progressive tax system. Even the Minister’s budget examples showed that somebody on very low earnings was getting back a quarter of what somebody on €70,000 or more was getting. I do not know how the Minister can say that is a fair distribution of whatever extra resources he had for tax breaks or concessions in the budget.</p>

Furthermore, someone on the standard minimum wage is also exempt from paying pay related social insurance, PRSI. As a result of the changes introduced in budget 2015 the weekly USC charge of €10.51 per week will fall to €7.19 per week. This means the individual's tax bill will be reduced by just over 20%.</p>
            <p eId="para_100"> In contrast a single individual earning €70,000 per annum currently pays €25,531 per annum or €490.98 per week and that individual's advantage is 3% whereas the advantage to the lower paid is 20%. </p>

            <p eId="para_101">The Minister should not be disingenuous. The question is very clear. Why did the Minister’s proposals for income tax and USC, as they stood when the question was tabled, disproportionately favour those on higher incomes? With what moneys the Minister had available to give back to people, why did he disproportionately favour those on higher incomes over those on the lowest incomes? It is a very straightforward question and the figures come from Social Justice Ireland to suggest that the Government decided to give 12 times more per week to a couple, both earning €125,000 a year, than it gave to a couple struggling on the poverty line. The Minister’s examples in the budget document showed that the people on the lowest earnings who are paying tax got back one quarter of what somebody on €70,000 got. I do not see how the Minister can say that is fair when the people who for the most part are out on the street or expressing their outrage about their inability to pay water charges are saying they cannot pay these bills. That is the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">The Deputy is challenging me on tax. I do not handle the social welfare budget. As people earn more, they pay more in tax. When one starts to unwind it and give relief, those that earn more will be advantaged when it comes to reducing the tax imposition, because they pay more tax. To avoid what the Deputy is challenging me with, I put a cap at €70,000. The maximum is €14 per week at €70,000, but the person on €120,000, €200,000 or €300,000 only gains €14 per week as well. For the first time we are targeting the low and middle incomes. The benefits to the low paid were delivered principally through universal social charge reductions and the benefits to the middle income earners were a combination of USC and, principally, income tax.</p>

            <p eId="para_107">Following our successful exit from the EU-IMF programme of financial support on 15 December last, we are now subject to EU post-programme surveillance and IMF post-programme monitoring. Twice-yearly review missions are conducted by the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF as part of post-programme monitoring and surveillance.  In this context, the second post-programme review mission took place between 17 and 21 November last.</p>
            <p eId="para_108"> Post-programme reviews have long been a feature of IMF programmes. In the European context, Regulation No. 472/2013, which is part of what is known as the two-pack, now provides for a similar arrangement for euro area member states in a post-programme situation. This regulation also provides for post-programme surveillance to be conducted by the Commission in liaison with the ECB. This is a different form of monitoring from that which applied during the programme. The objective of post-programme surveillance and monitoring is to assess Ireland's economic, fiscal and financial situation following the completion of the EU-IMF financial assistance programme. The focus of the assessment is on Ireland's ability to repay.</p>
            <p eId="para_109"> The meetings ranged from technical to policy discussions and were conducted by officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency, along with other relevant Departments and agencies. They covered the key areas of macroeconomic outlook and financial sector developments, with particular reference to the recently concluded European comprehensive assessment, the budgetary outlook, structural reform measures and the proposed early repayment of a portion of our IMF loans.</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> Following the mission, the IMF, the European Commission and the ECB issued statements setting out their preliminary conclusions. The IMF executive board will consider the final conclusions of the review mission in December, with EU consideration expected in January.</p>

Was the new regime that the Government announced, which is unacceptable to the Irish people, discussed with the troika members? Did they raise any concerns about, for example, the water conservation grant that has nothing to do with water conservation? Did the Minister inform the representatives that since the troika left the Government's support has plummeted and the Irish people have taken to the streets to reject some of the proposals the Government is introducing? In particular, what was the troika's position in respect of water, or are the reports wrong and water charges were not discussed?

I do not know what supplementary questions the troika members asked, if any, but it was a question of briefing rather than an attempt by the troika to advance a policy position from its perspective. The main issues were the macroeconomic situation, growth in the economy, the budgetary position and the earlier repayment of IMF loans. In other words, they were the types of issue one would expect to be raised by people whose primary concern was to assess Ireland's ability to repay not only the IMF loans but also the loans from the European institutions.</p>

We sometimes learn more about these matters from the media than we do in this Chamber. It is suggested that the mortgage crisis is another area that was discussed. Obviously, the Minister has changed his tune on how to deal with those seeking mortgages and restrictions on lending. The Central Bank has intervened very clearly and undermined the efforts of the Government with regard to Construction 2020 with its decision to decrease the maximum loan-to-value ratio for those applying for mortgages to 80%, although it might roll back a little on that. The Minister indicated that measures would be brought forward in the Finance Bill relating to mortgage insurance and that an assessment would be carried out before that Bill was introduced. None of that has happened and, as a result, the Minister has asked the finance committee to deal with the issue. Did this issue arise with the troika? What was the troika's view on the Government's intention of increasing mortgage availability by increasing loan-to-value ratios through a mortgage insurance scheme?</p>

The 80% ceiling is a controversial announcement and people have different views on it. Different organisations are making submissions, including the Department of Finance. We will provide our submission in the next couple of days.</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> I do not know whether the troika raised this with the Central Bank. Its members had meetings with the Central Bank and might have raised it. There was a statement from the Commission, separately from the troika visit, saying it supported the actions being taken by the Central Bank so that Ireland would not again encounter the problems it had previously. This is unresolved, but the Central Bank is independent.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">It is clear that interest rates in this State are out of sync with what they should be. The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, suggested that at the finance committee meeting last week, and also that he intends to do nothing about it. The Minister's response is that the Government is at arm's length from this and that it is due to commercial decisions by the banks. It is interesting that when the former Minister of State leaves these shores to take up residence in Brussels he has no problem returning here and telling us that the rates are a disgrace compared with the rates in other banks in continental Europe. He continues to lash out at the banks he oversaw up to a couple of months ago. Why can the Minister not have the courage of his convictions and state, as he did in the past, that variable interest rates are out of sync with what is happening across the water and that the variable interest rates in the State-controlled banks, at least, should come down? He should at least say that.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">The Minister does not have to introduce legislation, as the Taoiseach threatened at one stage, to provide the Central Bank with this power. He should be able to stand up on behalf of the people who put him in this position and say the rates are out of sync.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">The lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a shareholding, are independent commercial entities. I have no statutory role in whether regulated financial institutions pass on the ECB interest rate or in the mortgage rates they charge. They are commercial matters for each institution. The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of commercial decisions by the institutions concerned. This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including ECB base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_121"> The Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last week, stated that the banks' drive to restore their profitability, combined with the lack of sufficient new competition, has meant that, far from lowering their standard variable rates over the past three years as ECB rates have fallen, they have increased their standard variable rates. He also acknowledged that, until very recently, bank competition has been too weak in Ireland to result in any substantial inroads on rates. The Governor also stated that in most advanced economies, including Ireland, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants. In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost-effective banking services. In this regard, there has been some movement on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions, which suggests that the market may be entering a new and more competitive phase.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_123"> The Government has taken steps to ensure that the Irish financial market is accessible to any financial institution that is considering establishing itself in Ireland. In seeking to reduce the barriers to entry which are specific to the Irish banking market, section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, as amended, which provides for the regulation of bank fees and charges, has been disapplied for the first three years in the case of new financial service providers setting up in Ireland. This arrangement was provided for in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013. The imposition of regulation on the interest rates that commercial banks may charge will not assist in the development of competition in the banking sector and I have not seen any reasoned argument for such an imposition.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">There is clearly a lack of competition in the banking sector, and a number of banks are bogged down by loss-making tracker mortgages. Despite what some may think, not all tracker loan books are loss-making. I welcome AIB's move to reduce its variable interest rate. In continental Europe the average variable mortgage interest rate is 2.64%, compared to 4.5% here. We must consider what will happen when the ECB rate begins to increase, as it inevitably will, and how it will affect those who are struggling to pay their mortgages. It is only a matter of time before the rate increases.</p>
            <p eId="para_125"> We are not living in normal banking times. The State owns 99% of AIB, 99% of Permanent tsb and 15% of Bank of Ireland, and this puts an onus on the Minister to stand up and say the rates are out of line. The Minister had no problem intervening in AIB's share price, which is a dodgy issue for a Minister for Finance who owns the bank. He had no problem warning people that AIB's shares were overvalued and that they should not buy them. At least he should stand up and say the rates applied by banks that we own or in which we have a substantial shareholding are out of line with those in continental Europe and ask them to reduce their rates if they can.</p>

            <p eId="para_126">Three years ago, the banks were insolvent and an enormous amount of State funds had to be injected into them. Since then, the banking industry, particularly the banks the Deputy mentioned, have improved and secured their positions. However, the banking system is still in difficulty and is not operating like a mature banking system in a European country. The repair work continues, and they are doing well and providing much of the lending necessary. Competition is the best solution to the problems the Deputy has outlined. Now that there is banking union across the European Community, we encourage banks from abroad to establish branches here to increase competition in the banking sector. This is the only way to drive down interest rates.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">The former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Brian Hayes, said it was a disgrace. Either he was playing politics or he genuinely believes it. There are people in Fine Gael - maybe even the Minister, or the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, who is sitting beside him - who believe the variable interest rates are a disgrace and need to be reduced in line with the ECB reductions. Could they please find it in themselves to state that they agree with Mr. Hayes's statement that the interest rates are a disgrace? At least say something.</p>
            <p eId="para_128"> The Minister was correct when he said the banks were insolvent. They were rescued by the Irish people. The reason they are returning to profit is not some magical potion that is being concocted in the headquarters of AIB or Bank of Ireland but the exorbitant rates they are charging, the fact that they have not written off debt for struggling mortgage holders, the increased fees they charge and the fact that they have sacked thousands of workers and closed branches. Given that the banks have returned to profitability, they should be asked to consider reducing their variable interest rates, as the Government did when it first took office, when it was in tune with the Irish people. In the first year of the Government's term, it called the heads of the banks into Government Buildings and spoke to them about this matter, and they responded. Now, the Government has done a Pontius Pilate and washed its hands of it.</p>

There is no standard interest rate across the European Community from which we vary. There are variations in every country. There are different rates in different countries, depending on circumstances. In our circumstances, as a result of the impairment of the banks and the fact that they were insolvent, we are at the upper end of the spectrum. I hope that competition in the system will drive interest rates down and make the banks more competitive. It would suit the economy and job creation.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_131">That, pursuant to Standing Order 177, Standing Order 131 is modified to permit an instruction to the Committee to which the Social Welfare Bill 2014 may be recommitted in respect of an amendment, for which it has power to make provision in the Bill in relation to the payment of moneys by the Minister for Finance in respect of liabilities which may arise in relation to certain defined benefit pension schemes and to change the title of the Bill to take account of these provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">The amendments I am bringing forward will enable the Minister for Finance to draw moneys from the Central Fund to discharge liabilities which may accrue to the State in the event of the wind-up of a defined benefit pension scheme where both the employer and the scheme were insolvent, known as a double insolvency; where the date of the wind-up of the scheme was on or after 25 January 2007 and before 25 December 2013; and where the resources of the scheme are insufficient to fund a minimum level of benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">The issue of a potential liability on the State arises following the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the UK case of Carol Marilyn Robins and others <i>v.</i> the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, known as the Robins case, which was delivered on 25 January 2007, and in the Irish case of Hogan and others <i>v.</i> the Minister for Social Protection and others, known as the Hogan case, which was delivered on 25 April 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> Both of these cases were concerned with the transposition of Article 8 of EU Directive 2008/94, the insolvency directive. The original insolvency directive 80/987/EEC was transposed by Ireland via the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency)<i>
						</i>Act 1984. The consolidated directive 2008/94 did not amend Article 8 of the earlier Directive 80/987/EEC.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> The insolvency directive requires members states to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to protect the interests of employees and also the interests of persons having already left the employment of the employer, at the date of the employer's insolvency. This protection is in respect of rights conferring on them immediately or prospective entitlement under supplementary or occupational pension schemes. In a ruling on the Robins case on 25 January 2007, the European Court of Justice found that where the measures in place to protect the interests of scheme members fail to secure at least 49% of the member's entitlement then this level of protection was not sufficient to secure compliance with the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> In 2010, a case was brought on behalf of ten members of the Waterford Crystal staff and factory pension schemes against the Minister for Social Protection, the Attorney General and Ireland for the alleged failure by the State to properly transpose the insolvency directive and for consequent financial losses suffered. In 2011, the High Court referred certain matters to the European Court of Justice seeking clarification on provisions in the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> The European Court of Justice delivered its ruling in the Hogan case on 25 April 2012 and reaffirmed that where the measures in place to protect the interests of scheme members fail to secure at least 49% of the member's entitlement then this level of protection was not sufficient to secure compliance with the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> Deputies may recall that I amended the Pensions Act last year to change the manner in which the resources of a defined benefit pension scheme are distributed in the event of the wind up of a pension scheme where both the employer and the scheme is insolvent. The purpose of this was to ensure that all beneficiaries of the scheme - this includes pensioners, current employees and former employees who have not yet retired - receive at least 50% of their benefits and protect pension benefits in payment up to €12,000 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> The amendment at that time provided that where the resources of a defined benefit pension scheme are not sufficient resources to meet that level of liabilities then the State will provide funding from the Exchequer to address this shortfall in the resources of the scheme. In budget 2014 and in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 the Minister for Finance provided for changes to the pensions levy to provide funding to meet potential State liabilities emerging from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties. The legislation in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 is not retrospective and applies to double insolvencies arising after the date of the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 on 25 December 2013. </p>
          <p eId="para_140"> The amendment I am now bringing forward allows for payment from the Central Fund to be made by the Minister for Finance in situations where the State may need to address any liabilities that could arise between the date of the Robins judgment which was delivered on 25 January 2009 and the date of the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 - 25 December 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> The aim of the changes I introduced last year and the package of measures supporting those changes was to ensure as far as possible that the benefits of scheme members will be more secure; poorly funded schemes will become more sustainable and in the medium and long term achieve a fully funded position; and, the exposure of the State in the case of the wind up of a scheme where the employer is insolvent is minimised.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> It is considered that the amendments which I made to the Pensions Act last year secures Ireland's compliance with the insolvency directive. One of the key mechanisms for securing the solvency of a pension scheme is the funding standard requirement as set out in Part IV of the Pensions Act. This is a "wind-up" standard: it looks at the benefits that a scheme is obliged to provide should the scheme be wound up and defines the minimum assets that the scheme must hold in order to cover those liabilities. The funding standard was in abeyance since the end of 2008 until I reintroduced it in June 2012. The reintroduction of the funding standard has provided a clearer indication of the funding position of pension schemes. The reintroduction of the funding standard has provided an environment where the Pensions Authority can fully engage with schemes and, in particular, with poorly funded schemes to advise and support schemes achieve a more sustainable funding position.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> In advance of the reintroduction of the funding standard, I introduced legislation to require pension schemes to maintain additional funding in the form of a risk reserve to protect scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. It is the objective in the short term to support weaker schemes to achieve a more sustainable funding position, and in the medium term support all schemes to meet the requirements of the funding standard. Ultimately, pension schemes need to get to a place where they have provided for additional funding in the form of a risk reserve in order to protect the interest of scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. The application of the funding standard which the OECD report, Review of the Irish Pension System, which was published in April 2013, considered "undemanding" is key to achieving this level of scheme funding. Some 96% approximately of defined benefit pension schemes either satisfy the requirement of the funding standard, or have agreed, or are in the process of agreeing a funding proposal with the Pensions Authority. The remaining schemes are in dialogue with the Pensions Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> The number of defined benefits pension schemes in Ireland has reduced from 2,500 schemes in 1991 to 1,500 in 2003 and to 933 schemes with some 189,644 active scheme members at the end of 2013. The vast majority of defined benefit pension schemes are now closed to new members. However, while this change is in line with international trends it does not lessen the resolve of the Government to ensure that the funding levels in defined benefit schemes are sustainable, that measures are in place to secure compliance with the insolvency directive and that the system operates in a manner consistent with the public interest in ensuring the future sustainability of a system of private pension provision in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> Deputies will be aware that a number of changes have been made to the Pensions Act in recent years. The rationale behind these changes was to ensure that appropriate measures were put in place to balance the interests of all parties and ensure the sustainability of the defined benefit pension model. These measures included the reduction in the cost of providing pension benefits through the establishment of the pensions insolvency payments scheme and the introduction of sovereign annuities-bonds, the requirement to maintain a risk reserve in order to protect the interest of scheme members against future volatility in financial markets, and broadening the options available to employers and the trustees of defined benefit pension schemes to restructure scheme benefit in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme. All these measures have been underpinned by a range of measures introduced by the Pensions Authority to ensure that schemes comply with the pension scheme funding requirements as set out in the Pensions Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> I acknowledge that many schemes are making great efforts to ensure their ongoing viability and employers and members have often made significant financial contributions over and above those required by their particular trust rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">This process is generally managed through dialogue between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability. This may include a mix of measures, such as increased employer and member contributions, longer working and amended benefits. I am pleased to inform the committee that I have not received any application for funding to meet a shortfall in resources in a defined benefit pension scheme arising in the case of a double insolvency as provided for in the 2013 Act. In the event, however, that a scheme does become insolvent, the measures introduced have been designed to strike a fair balance between the interests of all members of the schemes. The 2013 (No. 2) Act, for example, ensures that 100% of defined benefit pensions in payment will be protected up to €12,000. Based on research in 2007 by the Society of Actuaries in Ireland showing that the average defined benefit pension being paid directly from scheme funds was €10,718 per annum, this measure ensures substantial protection for the majority of persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> I am hopeful the structures now in place will eliminate any recourse on the State to support schemes that wind up in a double insolvency situation. I expect that any liabilities that might exist prior to the 2013 Act will be resolved in the short term.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">Perhaps the Tánaiste can tell us why the amendment or change did not appear in the original legislation and has only appeared on Committee Stage. It seems to be an important amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> This is an amendment to private pension provision. I tabled a number of amendments on Committee Stage in regard to private pension provision, such as one to provide for an appeal against the decision of trustees and that no defined benefit pension scheme can close unless it is 90% funded. These amendments were ruled out of order as being irrelevant to the legislation. It seems beyond comprehension that this amendment can be relevant to the Social Welfare Bill and how those amendments are not, which were ruled out again today. The Tánaiste will say she does not make these decisions. Is it not peculiar that when we propose amendments to enable us to discuss the deferred pensioners of the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS, they are ruled out of order on the basis of being irrelevant, while something that changes private pension provision is ruled in because the Tánaiste wants to get it through today?</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> The Minister referred to the Robins case and Article 8. The decision was that if the provision is not at least 49%, it contravenes the relevant European directive. This legislation provides for 50%, which is the bare minimum. The Tánaiste mentioned a number of minor aspects relating to defined benefit pension schemes and concedes that the number of defined benefit schemes has diminished dramatically from 2,500 some years ago to 933 at the latest count. Has the Tánaiste considered substantial changes to the defined benefit pension scheme? All existing schemes are closed to new members. The demography of the country ensures that in 20 or 25 years we will not be able to maintain the State pension system at its present value in relation to the value of money. We should be doing everything possible to encourage people to provide for themselves. One way in which they could do so with a certain level of security is through defined benefit pension schemes, if we can resurrect them and reverse the trend. The Tánaiste will be aware that one of the major problems with defined benefit pension schemes is the method by which liabilities are calculated. It is artificial and gives a distorted view of the actual liabilities of the defined benefit pension scheme. Does the Tánaiste have proposals in that regard?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_77">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_158">Deputy Willie O'Dea mentioned the process of tabling amendments. Last week we were dealing with the Social Welfare Bill whereas this week we are potentially dealing with a social welfare and pensions Bill. This is not the way to do business. While I am not saying we should not deal with the amendments, if we had been aware of substantial changes to the nature of the Bill, we would have put more time into preparing amendments on the issue of pensions. While we introduced some amendments on Committee Stage, most of them were ruled out on the basis of putting a charge on the Exchequer or on the people. The same will happen later today. In many ways, the amendment comes out of the blue and, by its nature, changes the Social Welfare Bill to make it a social welfare and pensions Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> It is consequential on the 2013 Act, which introduced a provision to guarantee a portion of the pension entitlements in the case of double insolvency, when the pension scheme and the company have been declared insolvent. The Act guarantees 50% of pension benefits and, in the case of pensions in payment, 100% of the first €12,000. In the case of double insolvency arising after the passage of the 2013 Bill, the State is on the hook for the difference between what the scheme covers and the level of payment guaranteed. We had a long debate at the time, although not as long as we should have had, about the priority and order. I will not rehash that debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> The Department and the Tánaiste were not ready to propose this amendment on Committee Stage, which is the more appropriate time to deal with the amendment and tease out some of its peculiarities. When there is a major change to legislation, we receive an explanatory memorandum that explains the consequences. Seeking leave to introduce this amendment was done with one line at the committee. We did not have the text or a proper explanation.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">However, it was at this late stage when my office got to grips with it. An explanatory memorandum of some sort should have been provided not just to social welfare spokespersons but to every Deputy. This has the potential to impose a substantial charge on the Exchequer. Accordingly, every Member should have been entitled to some prior information on the effects of these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> When the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 was debated and we dealt with the priority order, questions were asked about the retrospective application of the legislation to the Waterford Crystal pensioners. I was informed then that a priority order could not be retrospectively applied to companies that were already insolvent. Today, we are introducing legislation which seems to address this very issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> I hope the Minister does not mind my pointing out problems with her amendment. It states that the proposed new section 4 refers to section 10 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013. Section 10 of that Act has nothing to do with pensions. It should read section 10 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013. This is a simple mistake but I hope the Minister has the time to check it and rectify it before we look silly. However, that is the nature of rushed legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> Why, in view of the delay in acting on this matter before, is there now a rush? In the debate on this legislation in 2013, I argued for the need for retrospective provisions. However, the relevant provisions of that Act have not been used at all since it was passed. At the time, I argued the relevant double insolvency that was being protected against in the future was that of Waterford Crystal. That predated the Act, as the company had become insolvent since 2009 and would be covered by the legislation. The Robins judgment in Britain, which found that the State had an obligation to protect a portion of workers’ pension entitlements where their employer had become insolvent, had been made in 2007. At that stage, we were also aware that the Waterford Wedgwood workers in Britain had received 90% of their pension entitlements, but nothing like that was offered in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Opposition Members do not have any figures before them, yet the Minister is asking us, as well as her backbenchers, to allow the State to write a blank cheque. How much in hock will we be to subsidise the State’s portion of the Waterford Crystal workers’ pension scheme? Will it be €100 million or €200 million? We deserve to have some kind of estimate. I understand there is an ongoing process with the Waterford Crystal workers which could be choreographed to resolve issues through mediation rather than going back to court. This is to be welcomed. These workers ended up with nothing in their pension entitlements and, regrettably, some of them have died since. That is the scandal of this system. This and the former Government did not act quickly enough when the European Court of Justice judged that the State had a liability to protect pensions in such circumstances. How many other similar cases are there? We know of Waterford Crystal because that was one of the large companies that folded at the time. The Department’s officials advised there are not many, but exactly how many other cases could potentially arise? It covers a long time, from 2007 to 2013. Could liabilities emerge if other workers in similar circumstances want to get their entitlements? Could this add substantially to the cost of this proposal? In the case of Waterford Crystal, it affected 1,300 members of the pension scheme, which had a deficit of over €100 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> In his 2014 Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance stated that the pension levy would pay for the cost of the guarantee. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton - maybe even the Minister herself - repeated this. The pension levy has been used to promise the earth, moon and stars, but it is unlike the bank levy, which is ring-fenced for a particular fund. The pension levy is supposed to pay for the jobs initiative and close the Exchequer deficit. How will the Minister guarantee that the pension levy will pay over €100 million for Waterford Crystal and other double insolvency defined benefit schemes in the future if it is not ring-fenced?</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> The pension levy is paid by those with defined contribution pensions, but this State guarantee is extended only to those with defined benefit pensions where the employer is insolvent. The reality is that the cost of this guarantee will come from general taxation. The Minister must make clear to Members what the implications will be for the State’s finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> It was made crystal clear by the Robins judgment in 2007 that action was required to protect pensions. For four years, the previous Government failed to act on this. With the 2013 Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act, the Minister dealt with future liabilities from double insolvencies but did not address the Waterford Crystal issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> This legislation barely scratches the surface of the pension crisis. We will be back to this again, regrettably, to ensure that inadequately protected pension schemes get better protection. Many schemes are in difficulties. On Report Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, we will try, given the restrictions on tabling amendments, to address the likes of the Irish aviation superannuation scheme. Changes to pension provisions were rushed outside the House to force workers and pensioners to accept a change to that scheme. The Abbey Theatre pension scheme is another one which did not get a full hearing as to why it was changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Changes were made a number of years ago to companies that were in difficulties with defined benefit pension schemes. The view was that they would not be in difficulties if things improved in the future but some employers took the opportunity presented by the downturn and the underfunding of these schemes to chance their arms and force defined contribution schemes on workers and deferred members. This group of people is not often mentioned in the debate because those involved do not have as many rights as active members or pensioners. Pensioners receive a pension and need greater protection and this is reflected in the priority order introduced by the Minister. My input on this issue has been with a view to guaranteeing a fair distribution in all circumstances to all contributors to pension schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> I am not opposing the introduction of this; I merely think this approach is strange as it comes many years after the European courts made the State aware that it has a liability in this area. We will address this further on Report Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">Like the previous speaker, I do not oppose the Minister's amendment but I think more debate is required. Some offices are fortunate to have the staff and support to tease out these issues but some of us do not have this support so it is difficult to grasp how changes can impact on people's lives. This discussion is on the legitimate expectations men and women have regarding pensions that were paid for over a long period. These people have discovered that problems with legislation mean they are not protected when a pension scheme collapses and in such circumstances they end up out of kilter and without the income they had expected. This matter arises due to decisions of the European courts and challenges in the UK and other countries. Workers have a legitimate right to be protected from pension fund crises and more debate is required on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Many of the amendments that were tabled have been ruled out of order, as usual, but it is good to see the amendments we tabled on the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS, and those on pensions remain to be debated. This has happened only because the Minister has decided to make a particular change to pensions relating to double insolvency. I welcome the opportunity to debate these matters in a more detailed way.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> The amendments tabled seek the introduction of a six-month check on how the rent supplement impacts on people's lives. I wish to put on the record of the House the details of an e-mail I received from people in an apartment block in Crumlin. The developer went into receivership and the apartments were in NAMA but were taken over by a vulture capital company. Tenants received notice that rent was to increase from €1,300 per month to €1,600 within 28 days and this will have a big impact on whether they can afford to pay the rent. It is outrageous that this is allowed to happen. Landlords are allowed to increase rent once a year, irrespective of inflation, wage levels or anything else. Rack-renting landlords wish to make quick profits and I think the points made earlier by Deputy Boyd Barrett to the Minister for Finance are apt. A rent cap should be introduced and if landlords have difficulty maintaining such a cap they should be dealt with individually and make their cases to the relevant person. At the moment people must find themselves almost homeless before their individual cases for rent supplement are considered. The Government should take the approach I mentioned rather than oblige ordinary people who find themselves homeless to seek an increase in rent supplement. Sometimes these increases are not given because they are considered individually. There should be rent controls and if landlords find them difficult they should talk to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, for support. It could be the case that landlords cannot pay their mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> I wish to mention another matter that was ruled out of order. We were asked by the Northside Civic Centre to examine the 15% deduction relating to people with historical payment problems. These problems may be the fault of the tenant, the Department's mistakes or something else. People can find themselves below the €186 threshold that is supposed to protect people. People with a property tax rate of €240 cannot have an income of below €186 because it is deemed the minimum necessary to live. Community Law &amp; Mediation asked us to table amendments to return this area to how it was at after the 2005 Act. There should be a six-year cap on the investigation of historical matters relating to this issue and a human rights standard should be applied. It was found that seeking the recovery of an overpayment could be a violation of constitutional rights. We wanted to address these issues through amendments but they were ruled out of order.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_181">I know that some of the things I wish to say are in order and I will find out if the other things are in order when I say them. The substantive issue here is the Minister's amendment. I understand that this amendment will give power to the Minister to authorise payments from the Central Fund to pension schemes that were insolvent but predate the passing of the 2013 legislation. If I am correct, the aim is to address the problems that arose at Waterford Crystal but I did not see a copy of the Minister's speech and I did not hear all of it. If I am correct about this amendment the workers will welcome it. I spoke to some of the workers before coming into the House and I believe negotiations are going on to resolve the terrible situation in which they find themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> It is appropriate that this should be discussed in the Dáil today because I was informed of another tragedy this morning. One of the Waterford Crystal workers died this morning. He had 40 years of service at the company but, because this matter dragged on for six years, he will never get his pension entitlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Whatever changes are made or whatever deal is concluded in respect of Waterford Crystal will not benefit him. I was informed by the same Waterford Crystal worker that in total 20 Waterford Crystal workers have died since the closure of the plant in 2009 and, equally, none of them will benefit. Their widows are distraught after the deaths of their partners and so on. Whatever comes out, they will not benefit from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> What they got on the basis of what was left in the scheme was in the region of between 18% and 28% of what they were entitled to, far short of what they should have got. These people worked for years, contributed to the scheme and had an expectation of their pension entitlement at the end of it. However, for six years now they have got only a fraction of it and some will have got nothing because they have passed away since. That is a rather tragic and awful situation for workers who worked hard all their lives with a legitimate expectation of a decent pension at the end of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> As I understand it, this amendment tries to deal with this situation retrospectively. It relates to the primary legislation and involves what the worker I was talking to this morning described as the miserable and cynical figure of 50%. That is the limit in terms of what can be paid out. Perhaps the Minister can clarify the matter in her response because the legislation passed at the end of 2013 referred to a figure of 50%. This legislation refers to the same figure and, therefore, I assume in so far as the Minister is attempting to deal with situations that predate the legislation, the 50% figure still holds. The Waterford Crystal worker put it to me that this was cynical given the Robins case ruling, in which a 49% payout was deemed inadequate by the European courts in respect of discharging the requirements of the directive. These requirements are not specific but when the courts were asked to rule on the matter they determined that 49% was inadequate. In response, the British Government introduced a figure of 89%. By contrast, we have picked a figure 1% over the 49% which the European courts deemed inadequate. The worker I was talking to today asked why was it that our Government seems to have less respect for the people of Waterford Crystal or for that matter any defined benefit pensioners and why does it deem them worthy of less decent treatment than the treatment of pensioners across the water by their government. That was the point made to me on the telephone by a Waterford Crystal worker this morning. Perhaps the Minister can come back to me on the matter. I am passing it on from the horse's mouth.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Certainly, we must deal with these issues and I am keen for clarity. I accept the bona fides of the person I was talking to who, by the way, is one of the pensioners affected. At the very least this deserves a proper discussion. The appeal he asked me to pass on to the Minister was to the effect that the Waterford Crystal workers should be treated decently in the negotiations which, I understand, are ongoing. As far as the pensioners involved are concerned 50% is not good enough. We should be considering something approximating the British figure of 89% of entitlements in respect of the support the Government should give for insolvent funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> There is another amendment I wish the Minister had included in the Bill. We will probably get a chance to discuss it later. I am keen to see an emergency measure to deal with the area of rent allowance. This is an emergency. The Minister has brought in late amendments to deal with other matters and I am keen to see similar emergency measures to deal with the crisis of rent allowance, since the associated caps are directly leading to the homelessness crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">I wish to reiterate a point for Deputy Collins. Understandably, amendments in respect of pensions are rather technical and complicated. This is because they are based on the law of trusts and the law of trusts is rather complex.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> The amendment I am bringing forward today will enable the Minister for Finance to draw down moneys from the Central Fund to discharge liabilities which may accrue to the State in the event of the wind-up of a defined benefit pension scheme. I set out the conditions earlier. As has been said, this stems from the Robins case in the United Kingdom and the case of Hogan and others <i>v</i>. the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, in respect of which the judgment of the European Court was delivered in April 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> I believe there is a fundamental misunderstanding on the part of Deputy Boyd Barrett. In the legislation we adopted there is a broad framework to protect 100% of defined benefit schemes up to €12,000. To put this in context, in 2007 the Society of Actuaries in Ireland showed that the average defined benefit pension being paid directly from scheme funds was €10,718. Deputy Boyd Barrett seems to be under a misapprehension. Our legislation protects up to 100% up to €12,000. I cannot remember if Deputy Boyd Barrett took part in the debate when that legislation was going through. Anyway, Deputy Boyd Barrett will appreciate that almost all workers who are members in whatever category of defined benefit schemes are people who have paid PRSI. Therefore, in addition to their defined benefit pensions, they have access to the State contributory pension. Deputies will remember that the discussions last year were in the context of 100% or nearly 100%, since there can be slight differences in how negotiations go. For example, sometimes people want an upfront lump sum and may then seek a smaller pension subsequently. Often in the case of a wind-up it is a matter of negotiation.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> Our structure envisages €12,000 from a defined benefit scheme and a further €12,000 to €14,000 in terms of the value of the State contributory pension. Deputy Boyd Barrett referenced the United Kingdom. I imagine the Deputy is aware that our State contributory pension is significantly higher than the State contributory pension paid in the United Kingdom. I imagine Deputy Boyd Barrett has taken that into account in his comments. The Deputy should not always be downing Ireland, because in many cases we have-----</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_200">Let me say this: it has been my objective as Minister for Social Protection to protect and safeguard as many defined benefit pension schemes as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Defined benefit schemes have been subject to enormous difficulties at certain stages due to collapses in various international equity markets. We have discussed on many occasions in the House the problems around the cost of buying German bonds. Thankfully, much of the crisis has at least begun to recede, if it has not receded fully. Deputy Boyd Barrett should not fail, as he frequently does, to acknowledge that Ireland has a strong social protection system, so much so that all the international and national evidence shows that poverty risk is reduced in Ireland by the greatest amount in the whole of the EU. That is a result of the strong protections in our social welfare system. I see the Deputy shaking his head as though he cannot believe the facts, but those are the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> I note that the function of this particular scheme is to enable the Minister for Finance to draw down moneys from the Central Fund to discharge liabilities which may accrue to the State on the winding up of a defined benefit scheme. This was discussed on a previous occasion in the context of other changes. In this case, the context is protecting as far as possible workers' pension entitlements. That is the purpose of what I am asking Deputies to do in the very unusual circumstance of a double insolvency. A question was asked - perhaps by Deputy Ó Snodaigh - on the potential number of double insolvencies. From the information I have, there are a number of Waterford Crystal schemes, including the one that is currently under the pension insolvency payments scheme, or PIPS. There are 610 pensioner members of the scheme. In terms of the discussions on the Hogan case and its consequences, I am advised that there are 1,774 people who were employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> In a case of double insolvency, which is thankfully a rare event generally, the company and, separately but at the same time, the pension fund became insolvent during the lifetime of the previous Government. The workers exercised their legal right to take a case through the Irish courts arising from what happened in 2007. It was their right to do that. I have been endeavouring to see the former Waterford Crystal workers obtain a settlement which benefits them and I would appreciate the support of Members in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> I offer my condolences to the family and friends of the former worker who died today. I do not know what the circumstances of the particular individual were, but I note the normal rules to reassure the Deputy in relation to Irish law. If a person has a spouse, the pension rules in particular may or may not provide for that. However, it has been a feature of these cases that the estates of deceased members may well qualify for proportionate shares depending on their particular personal circumstances and the rules of the relevant scheme. I wish to be clear about that, although the Deputy may know more about the individual's circumstances than I do. If the Deputy wants to give me the particular details, we can certainly make inquiries.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> Pension schemes are ruled by the trustees under trust law, not centrally by government. The Government oversees public service pensions, but private pension schemes are subject to regulation by laws from the Oireachtas rather than being run directly by the Government, as the Deputy seems to suggest. The amendment is intended to allow the draw-down of funds. I hope it receives the support of the Members here.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_209">In page 3, line 5, after "Acts;" to insert "to amend the Pensions Act 1990;".</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Amendment No. 22, which we have just discussed, will allow the Minister for Finance to draw down moneys from the Central Fund to discharge liabilities which may accrue to the State in the event of the winding up of a defined benefit pension scheme where both the employer and the scheme were insolvent, the date of the winding up of the scheme was on or about 25 January 2007 and before 25 December 2013 and the resources in the scheme were not sufficient to fund a minimum level of benefits. That situation is referred to as a double insolvency.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> The issue of a potential liability on the State arises following the European Court of Justice judgment in the Robins case, delivered on 25 January 2007, and the Irish case of Hogan &amp; Ors <i>v.</i> Ireland, in which judgment was delivered on 25 April 2013. Both cases were concerned with the transposition of Article 8 of EU Directive 2008/94, known as the insolvency directive. The insolvency directive requires member states to ensure that necessary measures are taken to protect the interests of employees and also the interests of persons having already left the employment of an employer at the date of the employer's insolvency. This protection is in respect of rights conferring on them immediate or prospective entitlement under supplementary or occupational pension schemes. In its decision in the Robins case on 25 January, the European Court of Justice found that where the measures in place to protect the interests of scheme members failed to secure at least 49% of their entitlement, the level of protection was not sufficient to secure compliance with the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> In 2010, a case was brought on behalf of ten members of the Waterford Crystal staff and factory pension schemes against the Minister for Social Protection, the Attorney General and Ireland for the alleged failure by the State to properly transpose the insolvency directive and for consequent financial losses suffered. In 2011, the High Court referred certain matters to the European Court of Justice seeking clarification on provisions in the directive. The European Court of Justice delivered its ruling in the Hogan case on 25 April 2012 and reaffirmed that where the measures in place to protect the interests of scheme members failed to secure at least 49% of the members' entitlement, the level of protection was not sufficient to secure compliance with the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> Deputies may recall that I amended the Pensions Act last year to change the manner in which the resources of a defined benefit scheme would be distributed in the event of a wind-up of a pension scheme where both the employer and the scheme were insolvent. The purpose of the change is to ensure all beneficiaries of the scheme, including pensioners, current employees and former employees who have not yet retired, receive at least 50% of their benefits and to protect pension benefits in payment of up to €12,000 per annum. As I indicated, this measure has been introduced against a background where many, if not all, of the members of a scheme have an entitlement to a contributory retirement pension. At the time the amendment provided that where the resources of a defined benefit scheme were not sufficient to meet the level of liabilities, the State would provide funding from the Exchequer to address the shortfall in the resources of the scheme. </p>
          <p eId="para_214"> In budget 2014 and the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 the Minister for Finance provided for changes to the pension levy to provide funding to meet potential State liabilities emerging from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties. The measures in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 are not retrospective and apply to double insolvencies that arise after 25 December 2013, the date of enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2013. The amendment allows for payments from the Central Fund to be made by the Minister for Finance in circumstances where the State may need to address liabilities that could arise between the date of the Robins judgment which was delivered on 25 January 2009 and 25 December 2013, the date on which the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2013 was enacted. I am hopeful the regime now in place will eliminate any recourse to the State to support schemes which wind up in a double insolvency. I expect liabilities that may have arisen prior to the 2013 Act to be resolved in the short term. </p>
          <p eId="para_215"> As a consequence of the changes to the Pensions Act 1990 proposed in amendment No. 22, it is necessary to amend the Long and Short Titles of the Bill and make some other technical changes. Amendment No. 1 changes the Long Title to provide that the Bill amends the Pensions Act 1990, as well as the social welfare Acts. Amendment No. 29 changes the Short Title from the Social Welfare Bill 2014 to the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2014. This amendment is also in line with amendment No. 30 tabled by Deputies Aengus Ó Snodaigh, Joan Collins and Clare Daly. In addition, amendment No. 29 provides for the collective citation of the amendments to the Pensions Act 1990 contained in the Bill with the Pensions Acts 1990 to 2014.</p>

In circumstances where the average pension is €10,000 we have sought to provide 100% protection for pensions of up to €12,000, save for arrangements that may apply in particular circumstances, for example, lump sums. That is what the legislation seeks to achieve. <i>Pro rata</i> protection is provided in respect of higher levels of pension provision.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">The view taken by the authorities in the United Kingdom was that in all cases the amount to be guaranteed would be up to 89%. The Minister has correctly noted that the State pension system is much more generous than the system in place in the United Kingdom and that 100% protection is being proposed for pensions of up to €12,000 per annum. Notwithstanding this, it is valid to point out that there is a hell of a difference between 50% and 89% protection. It could be argued that because sums of up to €12,000 are being fully guaranteed and we have a more generous social welfare and pensions system than in the United Kingdom, the Government would be justified in providing less than 89% protection, for example, 75% or 70%. The reality, however, is that it is providing the bare minimum because, to use the Minister's phrase, the signpost was 49% protection and the Bill provides for 50% protection.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">If the tragic death of Mr. Jonathan Corrie is to mean anything, it has to be a catalyst for change. Anyone who saw the place where he had tragically passed away could not have been untouched. One cannot be untouched by the sense of desolation, loneliness, coldness and sadness he must have experienced in the hours before he passed away on Sunday night or Monday morning. If that does not make us angry, touch us and make us determined as a people to address the issue, absolutely nothing will. The measure of the Government's response and ours as a people is not the holding of an emergency summit, welcome though that is, or a special Dáil debate on homelessnes; rather, the measure of our response will be what changes will be made and what will be done differently to prevent something like this happening ever again. That is where the focus needs to be. The alarm bells on the issue of homelessness have been ringing for some time. In the past two years alone, the number of people sleeping rough in Dublin has doubled. This year the number has increased by about 30% and it is not just a Dublin problem. The annual report of the Cork Simon Community refers to the fact that in the past three years there has been a fourfold increase in the number of homeless people in Cork city. Not only is homelessness an immediate issue but State policy is also resulting in a pipeline of people who could well become homeless in the months ahead. Homelessness is a complex problem. We all accept that it is not all about money. I heard Mr. Mike Allen of Focus Ireland confirm on "Morning Ireland" today that there would not be enough emergency beds in Dublin tonight if every homeless person was willing to take one. What short-term actions is the Government committed to taking to address the immediate crisis and what longer term steps does it intend to take to ensure the pipeline of people who are on the way to becoming homeless will be cut off immediately?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_116">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_236">Nobody can disagree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy. I am sure nobody in this House could describe the feelings of a person who has to fend for himself or herself on the streets of this city or others around the country. How can one describe the feelings of Mr. Corrie in the years, months, weeks and days before he passed away? The same applies to the families who find themselves homeless and who have to move to bed and breakfast accommodation or hotel rooms, or who end up on the streets. The situation to which the Deputy referred has been brought to light by the death of Mr. Corrie, but there has been a categorisation of the different elements involved, from those who are homeless and sleeping rough to those who have become homeless because of rent increases or a lack of space in terms of the availability of rooms, apartments and houses. </p>
          <p eId="para_237"> The longer term solution is as I outlined yesterday for the Deputy's party leader. The Government has reflected on and made decisions on this issue for some time. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has outlined the allocation of €2.2 billion for social and affordable housing, including direct provision accommodation by local authorities, voluntary housing agencies and so on, to deal with the issue by 2020. He also set out the timelines and targets for what was to be achieved. </p>
          <p eId="para_238"> In the shorter term for some months Dublin City Council has been working on bringing back into use over 1,000 rooms and facilities which are, as it calls them, "voided". I understand 265 are being worked on and that targets have been set for others to be brought back into use. I outlined yesterday the number of emergency rooms which would be brought back into use between now and Christmas. In cases in which individual circumstances warrant an increase in rent supplement local authorities can deal with the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> The answer in the medium and longer term is not a general increase in rent supplement. We have to deal with the question of supply. That requires taking into account the processes for planning, as well as income streams for contractors and those who will buy affordable housing. We need to be able to drastically increase the supply, which is why the Government has made decisions and allocated money in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> I agree with the Deputy that an emergency debate will not answer this question, nor will committee meetings, but they are part of a process in making decisions to put things into effect. As I said yesterday, in this day and age the vast majority of people in this city and others who sleep rough should not have to do so. Deputy Michael McGrath will be aware that some cases are very complex and that the circumstances that apply in each individual case are different. As he knows, Mr. Corrie was offered accommodation on many occasions, but, as was his right, he chose not to accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">They are, of course, factors in many cases but not all. The reality is that the rental sector is completely dysfunctional and in crisis. The policy of the Government of not allowing an increase in rent caps is resulting in many families not being able to rent privately and no council houses are available for them. Such families are living in emergency accommodation and many of them are, in effect, homeless. That is what it happening. None of us knows what is going on in the mind of somebody who is homeless, but I have listened to those who are at the coalface, who represent people who are homeless and are dealing with them day in and day out. They have said this is a national crisis. The Government could reconsider the issue of rent supplement caps, but it has dismissed the idea. A change would allow many people who are locked out of the private rental accommodation market to access a home, but the Government has refused to do this. Will the Taoiseach, please, explain why?</p>

          <p eId="para_244">Rent supplement plays an important part in the provision of accommodation. There are 71,800 persons in receipt of rent supplement, of whom 19,000, or 26% of the total, were awarded it this year. At the end of November, approximately 29,000 rent supplement recipients were on the live register, representing 8.2% of the total number. The Government committed funding of €344 million to the rent supplement scheme in 2014. It is not true to say money has been not been forthcoming. The current limits came into force on 17 June 2013, introducing some increases in Dublin and Galway. The limits in Dublin were increased by a weighted average of, I understand, about 9%.</p>

Those are the words of Jonathan Corrie two months ago. I am glad to see the unemployment figures have dropped to 10.7%, but that is still too high.

          <p eId="para_256">On 12 November I raised with the Taoiseach allegations made by a whistleblower from within the ranks of the senior Civil Service. The whistleblower in question was the authorised officer appointed to examine a scheme of tax evasion through Ansbacher accounts. He has come forward with allegations of tax evasion by senior political figures and of obstruction in the investigation and exposure of these wrongdoings. The whistleblower says his investigation into Ansbacher accounts, offshore accounts and tax evasion was terminated by then Minister, Mary Harney in 2004, once Mr. Desmond O'Malley was discovered to be one of the holders of these accounts.</p>

He further reports that agencies of the State have failed to investigate all of these matters thoroughly, including tribunals of inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> On 12 November, the Taoiseach directed me to the Committee of Public Accounts and said that was the proper place to have these matters investigated.

These are serious allegations. Will the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, allow the person in question to complete his investigation?

          <p eId="para_281">A law was introduced for whistleblowers to bring forward certain matters of information they feel are relevant, important and in the public interest. The law is framed to protect the whistleblower, which is an important reform and a central element of the law that must be maintained. The whistleblower must be protected.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">The Deputy is well aware of the reasons it was delayed. The Minister pointed out why it had been delayed and confirmed that the witness statement, as requested, had been forwarded to the fraud investigation unit, an arm of the State with particular and specific responsibilities and powers. I expect it to follow through and act on the witness statement forwarded to it. Clearly, the advice given to the Committee of Public Accounts is that this issue is outside its remit. I am sure that is the formal legal advice to it, although I have not seen or read it. The Deputy is a member of the committee. There is now an opportunity in the process of the law for the fraud investigation unit to act on the witness statement forwarded to it by the whistleblower and sent through the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for its examination. This is not an opportunity to send it on a journey from which it will never come back. This was a formal request from the fraud investigation unit that has now been acted on. The witness has had his statement forwarded, as has been confirmed.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">The Government is dealing with a number of legacy issues that were neglected by previous Governments. Progress is being made, which makes it all the more vital to get it right. The concerns and issues I want to address are those which arise for the ladies who suffered the most appalling procedure of symphysiotomy. Many of us have met them; we have listened to their stories and had a debate here when some of them were present in the Visitors Gallery. I acknowledge the work of Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin who chairs the Oireachtas group in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> The ladies in question had so many expectations and hopes the payments scheme would lead to justice for them, but, most regrettably, that is not their view of the scheme that has emerged, in which they have identified serious shortcomings and defects, the most serious of which is that the scheme is not in keeping with the concluding observations and recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Committee. For example, there are oppressive timeframes. There is a deadline of 20 days, from 10 November, which, in exceptional circumstances, to be decided by the assessor, can be extended by a further 20 days. This is very different from the scheme for hepatitis C and residential institution survivors. In addition, there is no right to appeal to the courts when the assessor decides a sum, the levels of payment fall far short of what has been awarded in the few cases decided through the courts and there is no reference to a thorough and independent investigation of the practice of symphysiotomy.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> All of us who have listened know about the inhumane, cruel and degrading treatment the ladies in question suffered. It is made all the worse by the fact that it was a treatment that was needless, a treatment about which they knew nothing and a treatment in which they had no hand, act or part during the entire procedure. The pain did not finish with the procedure; it continued and continues to this day for them. It is vital, therefore, that we get the scheme right for them in the interests of justice. How can the Taoiseach say they are receiving justice when 99% of the survivors are objecting to the scheme? Will he support their call for it to be withdrawn and replaced by one that meets the recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Committee?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_290">This is an issue of great personal concern to the women who had to go through this procedure. The Deputy is right on that point. I know Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin is one Member who has raised this issue on many occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> The options were stark. Every individual would have the opportunity to go to court to be involved in an adversarial conflict, the outcome of which could not be determined in advance. To avoid this, the Minister appointed a justice of the court to look at what the options for a scheme might be. She made very particular recommendations for payments of €50,000, €100,000 and €150,000, without the necessity of having to go to court but leaving open that option, if it were to be the choice of any woman involved. The figures were not determined by the Minister; they were brought forward by the justice in her fine report. The intention was to provide an option for women who had gone through this procedure to apply and receive prompt payment as determined and outlined by the justice in her report. That does not take away from their right, if they do not want to accept payment under the symphysiotomy scheme, to take a court case.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> I know that there are a number of groups involved and that one particular group does not accept the terms of the scheme, while others do. It is a choice that was followed through on the principle that the Minister had decided we should have a scheme because this matter was sensitive and personal and had to be dealt with. The justice set out a scheme that, in a non-adversarial way, will deliver the payments promptly to the women involved. It is their right, individually, to accept or reject them.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> As Deputy Marueen O'Sullivan will recall, we had the same in the case of the Magdalen scheme, when there was a lot of legal advice that people should take a different route and ended up in adversarial positions, in particular, women who had been through very difficult circumstances. That scheme, again determined by a justice, worked out well and payments have been followed through, with the provision of other facilities also. This scheme was determined and set out by the justice in her report, with the payments to be made promptly, while keeping the right for any individual woman to say: "I do not accept that. I want to take my case to court."</p>

          <p eId="para_294">I have to make the point that 99% of the known survivors do not accept that the scheme is meeting their need for justice. On that aspect, there is no reference to the perpetrators of this most cruel treatment. If a survivor accepts the payments, she has to waive irrevocably all rights and entitlements and "indemnify and hold harmless" the people responsible for imposing this suffering on them. I do not know how we can expect survivors to be willing to accept this, as it goes against what the United Nation's Human Rights Committee advocated. The chairperson of that committee said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_295">I simply don’t understand how the State can look the other way at what seems to have been a systematic assault on people who weren’t in a position to resist or even give consent in many cases. We called for prosecutions explicitly and I would hope, I have to hope, that the recommendation won’t be ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The ladies in question are not getting justice and it seems that the State is complicit in allowing the individuals, groups and institutions that were involved in this treatment to escape any sense of justice. I do not know what the Taoiseach thinks about restorative justice, but it is a very powerful tool. The ladies in question are being denied restorative justice and, if they take the payments, they will be denied the opportunity to go to court. They are being put in a very difficult position. At the very least, can there be a withdrawal of the waiver because there is an understanding that it is unlawful and a three-year entry period for those who want to make a claim?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_297">The Deputy quoted from the letter, but the State is not looking the other way. Actually, in response to claims made in the House by many Deputies, the State has responded by asking a justice of the court to look at the nature and scale of what was involved and set out a scheme to allow for prompt payment, depending on the nature and scale of the procedure women had to go through, while keeping the right and entitlement of every individual to have her case taken to court. Justice is determined by the courts on some occasions. I recently met Louise O'Keeffe who had her case taken to the High Court and the Supreme Court and who eventually, after 16 years, had a determination made by the European court. The rights and entitlements of the women who went through the symphysiotomy procedure are not infringed by the scheme set out by the justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">It is their opportunity, right and option to apply and have a prompt payment made to them relating to the scale of the procedure they went through. I do not know what purpose would be served by the extension of the waiver for three years if they do not lose their right to take their case to court if they wish. They know about the scheme and have voted on it in some cases. Two groups accepted it and a majority of the other one does not, which is its right, but the scale of payments are there and they do not lose their right or entitlement to have their case taken to court if they wish. I hope that they make a determination personally as to whether to apply under the scheme or take a longer and more adversarial route to court. </p>

          <p eId="para_304">I object to the proposal that there will be no Topical Issues tomorrow. It seems to me that the reason it is proposed that there will be no Topical Issues tomorrow is to lash through the Water Services Bill over Thursday and Friday with no vote until Tuesday to allow the Government side to be away from the debate on Friday down the country or whatever and not take part in it just like it did with the first round of the Water Services Bill. It is extremely important that there would be Topical Issues tomorrow. For example, the key Topical Issue yesterday was homelessness and no doubt, there will be other ones tomorrow. There should be a resumption of Topical Issues and the Government should stop lashing through the Water Services Bill. If it needs to be extended next week, it should be extended.</p>

We are allowing the House to sit until 8 p.m. tomorrow and 8 p.m. on Friday to give everybody an opportunity to have their say on Second Stage of the Water Services Bill. Members have been demanding this and they will get the time they need. For Deputy McDonald to come in here and say that we should have Topical Issues tomorrow when she sat over there for five hours, held up the work of this House and did not allow Topical Issues to take place at all means that she is either suffering from amnesia or is very selective in the points she makes.</p>

The Taoiseach is probably aware that there is significant concern among the survivors of the Westbank orphanage and some of the other Protestant institutions that they will be excluded from the terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> Could the Taoiseach tell us the progress of the Adoption (Tracing and Information) Bill? I understand it is due for publication some time in 2015 but it is a very urgent piece of legislation. I understand that it is complex but could the Taoiseach give a more concrete indication of when we might see it? </p>

          <p eId="para_316"> In respect of the mother and baby homes and the Westbank orphanage, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has almost completed work on the terms of reference. As they will have to be approved by this House, everybody will have an opportunity for debate. I know he is conscious of the Westbank orphanage but I cannot give details on the stage he has reached in that regard. I will ask him to advise Deputy McDonald on the progress made. He will also be in a position to indicate when he expects to bring the terms of reference, through the Government, for debate here.</p>

In view of the facts that one in five children under the age of 17 years and one in six adults lives below the poverty line, and that 130,000 children have fallen below the poverty line in the last four years according to the recent UNICEF report, does the Taoiseach think the Government's objective will be realised by the end of its term?</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_256">
            <from>Deputy Joe Carey<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_427">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important matter for debate. Major floods have taken place in Ennis through the years. Townspeople will recall serious floods in 1989, 1994, 1995, 1999, 2004 and late 2009. I welcome the fact that phase one of the Ennis flood relief scheme has stood up to the challenges posed by extreme weather events over the past couple of years. I look forward to the completion, in the next couple of months, of phase two of the scheme from Bank Place to Doora Bridge. Without the successful implementation of a flood relief plan in Ennis, there is little doubt further serious flood events would have taken place, with disastrous outcomes for local residents and business owners. Therefore, I welcome the serious flood alleviation work which has taken place in Ennis over recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_428"> The matter I raise today is the third and last substantial element of flood alleviation works required for Ennis. The project is known as the lower Ennis flood relief scheme or the St. Flannan's and Ballybeg flood relief scheme. Few will forget the scene of flood waters pouring over the boundary wall at St. Flannan's College in late November 2009 in floods which were said to have been the worst in 800 years. Householders in housing estates off the Clare Road, on Clonroadmore and Tobartaiscain had their houses invaded by flood water, with devastating consequences. I thank God we have not had a similar weather event since. However, we need to prepare for such an event by providing this vital flood alleviation scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_429"> The lower Ennis flood relief scheme involves the construction of a flood overflow culvert from St. Flannan's stream to the Clare Abbey flood plain, with associated overflow structure. It also involves the provision of a second flood overflow culvert from Ballybeg to the Clare Abbey flood plain, together with upgrading of the existing flood defence embankments between the Quin Road and the Clarecastle tidal barrage, including rehabilitation and construction of sluices and upgrading of the existing back drainage system. The St. Flannan’s and Ballybeg streams continue to pose serious flooding issues for householders in both Ennis and Clarecastle. Each winter, these streams are overwhelmed with water and at times of heavy rainfall, flooding is caused to houses and public roads. Much credit is owed to the outdoor staff of Clare County Council who battle against the elements with pumps to keep houses and roads free of water. However, this is an unsustainable solution. A permanent solution is required, namely, the provision of the lower Ennis flood relief scheme. It is essential that work commences on this important scheme in the coming months. People have waited patiently since 2009 for this problem to be finally tackled.</p>
            <p eId="para_430"> While much work has taken place on reports, planning and cost-benefit analysis by engineers in both the OPW and Clare County Council, people continue to ask me when work will start on the scheme. I have raised it many times with previous Ministers and I welcome the opportunity to ask the Minister of State when contractors will be appointed, when work will start on this long-anticipated scheme and how long the construction period is expected to be. Could the Minister also indicate how many construction jobs will be created during the construction phase of the project?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_431">I thank Deputy Carey for raising this important matter and for giving me the opportunity to address the House and update the Deputy and the people of Ennis about it. During November 2009, following an exceptionally prolonged and intense wet spell, Saint Flannan's College in Ennis, County Clare, and built-up areas in its environs, experienced severe flooding from Flannan's stream. This flooding, which was reported to have been the worst in living memory, forced the college to close for several days in addition to flooding or cutting off access to a number of homes in nearby estates. Furthermore, important town access roads in the area were impassable and an electricity supply substation at the college was switched off as a precaution due to the high flood levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_432"> It was agreed that Clare County Council would commission consultants with a view to bringing forward proposals to address the problem in this area, with funding from my office, the Office of Public Works. The project, which is referred to by the council as Ennis south flood relief scheme, will complement the Ennis upper scheme, which was completed some years ago, and the Ennis lower flood relief scheme, which was completed this year. Clare County Council engaged Hydor Environmental Ltd. to produce a feasibility report on St. Flannan's Stream with a view to implementing a flood alleviation scheme. Following from this report, the preferred option consists of very substantial upgrading of approximately 2 km of embankments and the construction of two culverts approximately 1.4 km in length, together with a pump station and associated works.</p>
            <p eId="para_433"> All flood relief schemes that are funded by the OPW must meet certain criteria, including acceptability on cost-benefit grounds. The OPW and Clare County Council engaged in discussions over some months regarding aspects of the cost-benefit analysis of the scheme completed by the council's consultants. Arising from these discussions, the OPW has recently notified the council that it is now satisfied that the scheme is economically justifiable and has advised the council of its agreement that the project should proceed. I know that will come as great relief to Deputy Carey and others in Ennis.</p>
            <p eId="para_434"> Clare County Council is at present conducting a tender competition to appoint contractors to carry out the works. It is expected that a tenderer will be selected in the coming weeks, and the council hopes to be in a position to award the contract in late January or early February 2015. The council expects that works will then commence in late February or early March 2015. I am pleased to be able to provide that definitive timeline to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_435"> I want to assure the Deputy that I and the OPW are fully committed to supporting Clare County Council in implementing the scheme for Ennis south in the shortest possible timeframe. I can further confirm that the OPW has made provision for the scheme in its multi-annual budget profiles to 2017. Funding for this scheme is in place, and I hope and expect that Clare County Council will now appoint a tenderer as quickly as possible and that construction will commence in February or March 2015 to provide much-needed assurance, relief and confidence to the people of Ennis.</p>
            <p eId="para_436"> Regarding the number of construction jobs, I will ask my office to revert to the Deputy on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_437">It is very welcome news that this scheme will finally get off the ground. It is welcome also that contractors will be appointed in late January, with construction to commence in February or March. This is a much-needed scheme, the need for which I have outlined. I compliment the engineers in Clare County Council and the OPW on the work they have done to date. I compliment also the outdoor staff of Clare County Council for their work in the interim in keeping houses and public roads free of water.</p>
            <p eId="para_438"> This scheme is vital. I look forward to its moving to construction early in February or March. I hope that timeline is adhered to and that construction will commence on those dates. I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and this positive news.</p>

            <p eId="para_439">I am delighted to be able to provide Deputy Carey with this information and good news for Ennis. It is an issue he has pursued for some time with me and my predecessors.</p>
            <p eId="para_440"> It might be useful to inform the Deputy and the House that Clare County Council has estimated that the all-in cost of the scheme, inclusive of all professional fees and other costs, will be in the region of €3.6 million. As I have already outlined, it is expected that the scheme will commence in either February or March of 2015. The next significant date in terms of timelines is the appointment of a contractor, which I hope will happen very soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_441"> It is also worth noting the other flood relief projects that have been undertaken in the Ennis area. The Ennis lower flood relief scheme works were substantially completed in September of this year; there is a bit of routine snagging going on. The estimated outturn for that scheme is approximately €11.2 million. We also have the Ennis Fior Uisce scheme, the contract for which Clare County Council expects will be awarded in early January, with works commencing in early February. The works will consist of embankments and flood walls, along with a surface water pump station and associated works to the surface water and sceptre pipes.</p>
            <p eId="para_442"> Regarding Thomond Villas, Clare County Council is currently carrying out preparatory investigations with a view to submitting an application under the minor flood works and coastal protection scheme. That scheme is very useful to councils, because local authorities can apply to my office for funding of up to €500,000 to carry out minor flood relief works - minor in terms of cost but major in terms of the impact on people in communities across Ireland. That is something Clare County Council is considering with regard to Thomond Villas, and should we receive an application, we will endeavour to process that as efficiently as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_443"> I look forward to the commencement of the Ennis south scheme in 2015 and to being there with Deputy Carey when the scheme is completed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_444">I thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this most important topical issue. Yesterday, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, review of pre-hospital care emergency services was published. While there have been many positive developments in our ambulance services in the past ten years, the HIQA review of pre-hospital care emergency services is a cause for great concern. It found that the National Ambulance Service, and many hospitals, struggle to routinely meet their targets. Additionally, it found a lack of effective leadership, clear strategic planning and ongoing constructive co-operation between management and staff in the National Ambulance Service. This must be acted on with the greatest urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_445"> Alarmingly, the report tells us that a number of staff reported that they did not have appropriate technical knowledge for their positions. HIQA also says it is unacceptable that, owing to the lack of clinical audit in the National Ambulance Service, quality assurance of clinical care is very limited, especially for staff who have completed training.</p>
            <p eId="para_446"> The review also highlights the deficiencies in dispatch and response. Three different computer-aided dispatch systems were in use at the time of HIQA's review. Those systems are not integrated, which means the National Ambulance Service continues to operate as six different services within defined geographical areas rather than as one national entity. That means there appears to be limited visibility of ambulance resources outside the geographically defined areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_447"> The most disquieting finding is that there is a lack of effective leadership, clear strategic planning and ongoing constructive co-operation between the management and staff of the National Ambulance Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_448"> This must be acted on with the greatest urgency. It is alarming that a number of staff reported that they did not have the appropriate training knowledge. </p>
            <p eId="para_449"> The disjointed relationship between the National Ambulance Service and the Dublin Fire Brigade is also highlighted in the review. Both bodies should move swiftly to publish the joint action plans that HIQA is recommending.</p>
            <p eId="para_450"> It is clear there is a need for more resources in our ambulance services, just as it is clear that there is a need to better manage those resources. The Government must act on the former and the National Ambulance Service must act on the latter. It seems from the reports today that the HSE has admitted that urgently needed improvements to the ambulance service will have to be delayed because of a lack of resources. The HSE is indicating now that longer target response times may be introduced for ambulances in rural areas compared with those operating in cities.</p>
            <p eId="para_451"> With regard to first responders, the National Ambulance Service seeks to have one on the scene of an emergency call within seven minutes and 59 seconds in at least 75% of cases. The best monthly results for ECHO calls involving immediately life-threatening cardiac and respiratory arrest was 58%. The best result for DELTA calls involving other life-threatening situations was 34%, just over one in three.</p>
            <p eId="para_452"> HIQA says that the National Ambulance Service demonstrated consistent underperformance in the efficiency of call taking and the processing of emergency calls. That has contributed to poor response times to ECHO and DELTA calls.</p>
            <p eId="para_453"> I am glad the Minister for Health is in the House to take this important item. What action does the Government plan to take in light of this report?</p>

            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Leo Varadkar)<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_454">I very much welcome the HIQA report on the ambulance service, which was requested by my predecessor, the former Minister, Deputy Reilly, some time ago. The report provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the progress made in pre-hospital emergency services and to acknowledge the challenges and opportunities ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_455"> I am aware there are shortcomings in the current service provision. However, I assure the House that I am committed to improving services and performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_456"> The National Ambulance Service is modernising and reconfiguring its services so they are delivered in an appropriate and timely manner. A significant reform programme is under way for a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system supported by improved technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_457">The emergency services have come a long way in recent years, from providing basic care and transport to advanced and sophisticated treatment for people in crisis. While the report confirms that we are on the right path in terms of service reform, it also sets out much of what remains to be done. Many issues identified in the report have been dealt with or are prioritised to be dealt with in 2015. A key component of reform of the ambulance service is the single national control centre in Tallaght, with backup in Ballyshannon. This will be completed in 2015 and, with the single computer aided dispatch system, provide the opportunity to further improve call taking and dispatching.</p>
            <p eId="para_458"> With the recent transfer of the Limerick control centre to the national platform, call taking and dispatch functions are now separated in all National Ambulance Service control rooms. The ambulance turnaround framework, to address ambulance delays at hospitals, is being implemented. The national service plan provides for 47 new ambulances next year. In addition, the 50 plus intermediate care vehicles are doing a lot of the work that previously fell to be done by the emergency fleet.</p>
            <p eId="para_459"> The HIQA report highlights a lack of clinical audit in the National Ambulance Service and this is of great concern. However, I am pleased that funding is provided in the 2015 service plan to initiate effective clinical auditing for the first time. Funding is also provided to expand the number of community first responders and to go a long way towards ending on call in the west.</p>
            <p eId="para_460"> While an extra €5.4 million has been provided for the National Ambulance Service in 2015, it is not all about resources. One of the most valuable matters identified in the HIQA report is how much more could be done with current resources. An example is dynamic dispatch. Too many ambulances spend too much time waiting in fire stations, ambulance control centres or at hospitals when they could be dynamically dispatched like so many other fleets. From where ambulance calls are going to come is predictable; they rarely come from next door to the ambulance station. We must examine alternative models of care, given that every patient who calls an ambulance does not need one and certainly does not need to go to an accident and emergency unit. In many countries, as little as 60% of the people who call an ambulance are taken to an accident and emergency unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_461"> The report is particularly critical of the relationship between the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade. This is a long-standing issue which has not been addressed to date. The HIQA report, with the awaited capacity and Dublin ambulance review, will give us a clear evidence base to finally establish a fully integrated service in the Dublin area. When we have the reports, I will consider them and request the HSE to prepare an action plan which I will bring to the Government. Taking the findings of the three reviews together, we will develop a comprehensive and coherent response. My Department will work with the HSE to ensure the development of an action plan, with timelines, to realise a new vision for ambulance services in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_462">Every month the HSE management data report provides figures for the percentages of incidents responded to by a patient-carrying vehicle in 18 minutes and 59 seconds or less. It does not supply figures for first responders. Can we see the figures published on a monthly basis?</p>

            <p eId="para_463">I am not sure if the figures are calculated or available, but I will look into the matter. I am not sure if the Deputy has had a chance to read the report from cover to cover, but, for anyone who has, it is abundantly clear that an overemphasis on crude response times is not a good idea. In other parts of the world overemphasis on response times has caused ambulance services to pull out of rural areas because the times set were not achievable. This effectively handed services over to helicopters, which is not the right or the best thing to do. We must be careful, therefore, about how we address the issue of response times. The Deputy knows rural Ireland well and that a call time of less than eight minutes would be very difficult to achieve in many parts of the country, short of having an ambulance in every parish or firm. We want to move towards a clinical audit to actually find out what happens to patients. Where someone is not reached by an ambulance in eight minutes and 30 seconds, he or she may be defibrillated, intubated and recover in hospital. That is considered to be a failure, yet someone could be reached within three or four minutes and die in the ambulance, but it is considered a success, which is absurd. That is why we must move towards having a proper clinical audit to find out exactly what happens to patients from the time they call a ambulance to the time they reach the hospital. I am glad that we are moving towards a clinical audit for the first time in 2015. The Dublin Fire Service does some of this work already.</p>

            <p eId="para_464">This issue is by no means the most important before us, but it is a regular niggle. I have been approached by one of the many groups in my constituency involved in the Tidy Towns competition. In Clondalkin, Palmerstown and Lucan there are active Tidy Towns groups which have done a great deal to improve the public ambiance of our area and I greatly appreciate their work. In other parts of the greater Dublin area various groups, including businesses, have done a great deal to improve the layout of their areas. However, one scourge that affects a great number of places in Dublin and other parts of the country, with which I am not so familiar, is graffiti which undermines the work of the many people who have done so much to deal with the litter problem in Dublin and its environs. It also damages the reputation of the city. The Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, previously held the tourism brief and knows how important it is to present ourselves in the best light. In asking that the graffiti issue be tackled, I am doing something that will be of general benefit to the city and the country as a whole. It costs the four Dublin local authorities €600,000 per year to tackle the problem. This money could be better spent on other things.</p>
            <p eId="para_465"> Other cities around the world have a problem with graffiti and some have come up with innovative ideas to tackle it. I would appreciate it if this information could be passed on to the relevant Minister, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly. In Chicago the sale of aerosol cans is restricted to those over 18 years and people must provide pictorial evidence of identity and sign for the cans purchased. That would help to tackle the issue, although I assume legislation or by-laws would help to deal with it also. I would be grateful if we could make some moves toward sorting out this problem.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_265" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_466">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly. I assure the Deputy that I am fully aware of the blight on communities which graffiti causes, both in the greater Dublin area and nationally, and that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is totally committed to tackling the issues of graffiti and vandalism.</p>
            <p eId="para_467"> Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009, primary responsibility for management and enforcement responses to litter pollution, including the defacement of structures by writing or other marks, lies with local authorities. The role of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is to provide the legislative framework within which they can perform this task. It is a matter for each local authority to decide the most appropriate public awareness and clean-up actions for graffiti, taking account of local circumstances and priorities. Each local authority must determine the level of expenditure on individual local services as part of its annual estimates process and prioritise its resources accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_468"> Section 19 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 makes it an offence to deface property visible from a public place without the written authority of the relevant owner, occupier or person in charge. A local authority or its agents may, on such terms and conditions as may be agreed by it with the occupier, enter and take remedial action to remove or otherwise remedy the defacement.</p>
            <p eId="para_469">Section 20 is a complementary provision that enables a local authority, in the interests of amenity or of the environment, to take remedial action against graffiti, irrespective of whether it has been put up with the consent of the owner or occupier. The local authority may serve a notice on the occupier requiring steps to be taken to remove or otherwise remedy the defacement in a specified period of not less than seven days. Failure to comply with a notice is an offence. In the case of an offence, the local authority may give effect to the notice and recover costs. The local authority may also, by arrangement with the occupier, take steps to remedy the defacement. It is an offence to obstruct or impede a local authority in its actions under sections 19 and 20.</p>
            <p eId="para_470"> Maximum penalties attaching to littering and graffiti offences are substantial and include an on-the-spot fine of €150. The Protection of the Environment Act 2003 introduced the possibility of conviction on indictment for litter and graffiti offences with a maximum fine of €130,000. The maximum fine for summary conviction in the District Court is €3,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_471"> In addition to the Litter Pollution Acts, the Criminal Damage Act 1991 also provides for the offences of damaging or defacing property. The Garda takes the defacing of and damage to property very seriously and, when such offences are detected, perpetrators are processed through the courts or via the juvenile liaison system, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_472"> As part of the overall response in dealing with graffiti, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government operates an anti-litter and anti-graffiti awareness grant scheme whereby local authorities can apply for funding for projects aimed at raising awareness of litter and graffiti issues in their functional areas. Under the scheme, the maximum grant allowed per project may be up to 70% of the cost involved. Local authorities are asked to focus their activities under the scheme on young people and in particular on schools and community groups with an emphasis on encouraging long-term behavioural change.</p>
            <p eId="para_473"> Grants can cover a broad range of measures to raise public awareness and to stimulate anti-litter and anti-graffiti activity at local level. Measures such as local clean-ups, primary and secondary school competitions, the provision of anti-litter and anti-graffiti materials, videos, posters, information leaflets, and anti-litter and anti-graffiti exhibitions are eligible for grant aid. In excess of €840,000 was allocated to local authorities from the environment fund under this scheme in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_474"> The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, is aware of the issues arising for communities where graffiti presents a significant challenge. In addition to the measures outlined earlier, there is also the website, <i>www.fixyourstreet.ie</i>, a service launched in August 2011 whereby non-emergency issues can be reported to a local council. <i>Fixyourstreet.ie</i> consists of a publicly accessible website with associated mobile technologies on which issues such as graffiti, road defects, street lighting, water leaks, drainage issues and litter or illegal dumping can be reported.</p>
            <p eId="para_475"> The solution to graffiti lies in a combination of different approaches, including education to promote individuals taking responsibility for the behaviour and anti-graffiti initiatives supported by the Department, as well as enforcement through the Litter Pollution Acts and, where appropriate, the Criminal Damage Act. The Minister is satisfied local authorities have adequate powers under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 and 2009 to tackle the problem of graffiti and have adequate resources to discharge their responsibilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_476">The Minister has a slightly longer version of the circulated reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_477"> I appreciate the reply. I know anyone putting up graffiti is breaking the law with measures in place that can be taken against them and there have been cases where this has happened. However, an alternative approach is needed such as restricting access to aerosols. Not having access to the materials used to put graffiti up would have a positive and beneficial impact on our environment. There are two ways in which this problem could be addressed; one is the legal route in terms of the application of fines, etc., and the other is to restrict access to the materials used by graffiti - I should not say artists - but the Minister knows what I mean. That would have a beneficial impact on the city and indeed the country. I would appreciate if this could be passed on to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_479">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise an issue of paramount concern to the 360 employees of Lisheen Mine, County Tipperary, the entire community of Moyne and the wider region, and for allowing me to discuss what stands to be one of the most devastating losses of employment ever seen in the premier county.</p>
            <p eId="para_480"> Lisheen Mine is a lead and zinc mine located in Moyne-Templetuohy outside of Thurles. It is in its second decade of operations and is one of the largest producers of zinc concentrates in Europe. Since its opening, it has proved to be the lifeblood of the small rural economy, providing quality employment, state-of-the-art infrastructure, invaluable community supports and delivering a degree of security in an area that is otherwise devoid of industry. After 17 years of employment and income for countless families, Lisheen Mine has confirmed it is progressing with its phased wind-down of operations with a voluntary redundancy programme that will facilitate the exit of almost 40 employees by March 2015. Further scaling back of operations is expected in the new year with the remaining 300 jobs being lost by October 2015. A small number of staff will be maintained after October for the final closure and site remediation.</p>
            <p eId="para_481"> While it was always known this was a finite resource and a fully funded mine closure and redundancy plan has been agreed, the commencement of the wind-down has sent alarm bells ringing across the entire region. The reality is that with less than a year to go until the complete shutdown of operations on the site, the Government is woefully unprepared for the imminent redundancy of 360 individuals, as no alternative company or industry has been identified for the Lisheen site.</p>
            <p eId="para_482"> The impact of the loss of Lisheen Mine, not just to the Moyne-Templetuohy area but to Thurles and the surrounding areas, is unquantifiable both in monetary and other terms. The mine is a key local employer and provides much of the employment in the wider area, being one of the largest employers in Tipperary. While the company has taken considerable steps to provide training and education to its employees, we are now facing a situation whereby 360 people are becoming unemployed with 70% of these being from the local area. This will have a devastating impact on the countless families who relied totally on Lisheen for employment and whose income will now be decimated.</p>
            <p eId="para_483"> This loss of income in turn will have a potentially ruinous effect on the local economy. Lisheen Mine puts a huge amount of money into the local economy in the form of wages to staff and expenditure on goods and services. Once the facility ceases operations there will be a mammoth reduction in income to the region and an unimaginable loss of spending power in the villages and towns. Lisheen's employees support the local businesses and services, whether it is only in buying milk or the newspaper on the way home, dropping into the local pub for a drink, having a car serviced or even having children enrolled in the local national school. Aside from direct employment, Lisheen Mine has also supported many secondary and support jobs in the local communities through the supply of transport, mining supplies, security and catering. The consequences of the closure of Lisheen are far-reaching and touch on every aspect of day-to-day life.</p>
            <p eId="para_484"> Lisheen Mine is not alone an employer but has put itself at the heart of the local community through its support for sporting, educational and cultural initiatives. The site's contribution to the economic and social life of the area is greatly valued and appreciated and the Lisheen management team developed excellent relationships with the local community. Since 2008, Lisheen Mine has donated close to €2 million towards sustainable projects for the area including donations to various organisations in the fields of arts, sports, health and education.</p>
            <p eId="para_485"> Where do we go from here? This is a strategically placed, turnkey condition development with unrivalled infrastructure and facilities. It offers enormous potential for additional or alternative industrial development boasting a land bank of 1,125 acres, an on-site 110 kV substation grid connection, 30 wind turbines, and an on-site fresh water supply of 50 million litres per day along with a water treatment plant.</p>
            <p eId="para_486">It is conveniently located close to the M8 motorway, almost equidistant from Dublin and Cork and the port and airport facilities they offer, not to mention the fact that there is a highly skilled and experienced local work force.</p>
            <p eId="para_487"> While a task force has been established to identify opportunities for alternative employment creation, I feel there must be a more concerted, visible effort by the Government and the IDA to attract an alternative industry. At present the future of Lisheen is shrouded in uncertainty and doubt and a concerned community is being left in the dark. We are entering the 11th hour and the time to save these jobs or provide alternatives is running out. In the next four months the first casualties will be felt and I am urging the Minister of State to step up efforts to ensure that Moyne is not forgotten.</p>

            <p eId="para_488">I thank Deputy Lowry for raising this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_489"> The confirmation by Vendata that Lisheen Mine is progressing its phased wind-down of operations at the lead and zinc mines outside Thurles, in accordance with plans agreed with employees in 2009, is of course to be regretted. I appreciate that the closure, although planned well in advance and not unexpected, will have a devastating impact on the 360 employees and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_490"> Since 1997, the company has provided valuable employment in the area. As everybody involved in mining knows, each mine is a finite resource that eventually becomes exhausted. In the case of Lisheen it was expected to be exhausted by 2013 but the success of mineral recovery at the mine has extended its life by two years to October 2015. The company, in the exercise of its corporate social responsibility, has initiated a comprehensive out-placement programme for all staff members to provide them with a competitive edge in the jobs market.</p>
            <p eId="para_491"> In 2012 the Tipperary county manager approached Lisheen to initiate a task force to look at replacement industries post-closure. That task force was made up of representatives of Tipperary County Council, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Lisheen Mine. The task force was sidelined when BEET Ireland approached Lisheen with a view to setting up its beet processing and ethanol plant at the site. Unfortunately, despite lengthy discussions, this project did not proceed. The task force has been re-activated under the chairmanship of Liz O'Donnell, with the full support of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly. It now includes the head of the Tipperary local enterprise office, LEO, in addition to representatives from IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Tipperary County Council. The enterprise development agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Tipperary local enterprise office, are working closely with one another and with local stakeholders, including Lisheen Mine management, with a view to finding a replacement industry for the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_492"> As the Deputy said, the Lisheen site is comprised of 1,125 acres and is strategically located adjacent to the M8 motorway. The site is well placed for both national distribution and export. It has its own electrical substation, ample water supply, a water treatment plant and other logistical and infrastructural benefits that make it attractive for investment. The nearby town of Thurles is on the main Dublin to Cork intercity railway line. I know from speaking to him that the Minister, Deputy Kelly, engaged with the IDA, officials in my Department, interested parties and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, prior to my appointment, to scope out opportunities for potential investors.</p>
            <p eId="para_493"> IDA Ireland is actively marketing the Lisheen Mine site to potential clients and I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that, following a presentation made by IDA Ireland to a potential client in the United States, the potential client made a preliminary site visit to the Lisheen site in recent weeks. Of course, it is very early days and the Deputy will appreciate that I am unable to elaborate further at this time but it is very positive news that illustrates the Government's commitment to ensuring we identify investors for the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_494"> Meanwhile, the Tipperary local enterprise office has delivered start your own business boot camps and held mentor clinics on site to assist employees contemplating starting their own businesses. This type of intervention will continue up to and after the closure of the mine. I am hopeful that the area will attract the sort of industry its location merits.</p>

            <p eId="para_495">I must remind the Minister of State that the creation of a task force does not absolve the Government of responsibility in this matter. It is barely credible that we still do not have an alternative four months from the first termination of employment in this matter. I appreciate that the task force is very committed, has worked hard and is using its best endeavours to attract alternatives but we need more input from IDA Ireland, led by the Government. This is an exceptional site with all of the attributes, services and facilities required by major manufacturing industries. We must ensure we do not give up on the idea of attracting a major industry and settle for small industries instead, just so we can say the site is still open.</p>
            <p eId="para_496"> I appreciate the response of the Minister of State but I ask that he and the Government be conscious of the fact that this issue has enormous consequences for the economy and the lives of many people in the Tipperary area. We need a positive and active response.</p>

            <p eId="para_497">I appreciate Deputy Lowry's remarks and reiterate the Government's commitment to working with the task force, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and other relevant agencies to ensure we can continue to attract employment and industry to the area. The aim is to address the issues that will emerge after the closure of the Lisheen site. It is an attractive site and I have learned more about it in recent days. The site has huge potential and the IDA recognises this - that is why the area has been marketed to potential US clients. There was a site visit in recent weeks and this is a significant development upon which I hope the IDA will build.</p>
            <p eId="para_498"> Ireland has had success in recent months in continuing to attract the sort of foreign direct investment, FDI, we seek. A day does not pass without a significant jobs announcement made by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and me. The IDA has contributed in terms of FDI and Enterprise Ireland helps indigenous exporting businesses. We are in a positive place and I am passionate about the need for balanced regional development. It is very important that the economic revival we are experiencing is felt across the country and we must ensure there is significant investment in areas like Tipperary, my constituency and across the country. People must have access to the opportunities to which they are entitled. I assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to work with the IDA on this site as it is significant. It is important that we create opportunities for the people currently working in Lisheen.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_500">As we discussed earlier, this Government amendment relates to defined pensions and cases of double insolvency.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The Government amendment is broadly to be welcomed. It is rather technical and, therefore, the Minister of State should feel free to correct me if I am wrong. As I understand it, the amendment allows the Government to discharge moneys from the Central Fund to assist in situations that arose prior to the passage of the legislation in 2013 in which a pension fund or company became insolvent and the pensioners were left without proper pension entitlements. In particular, by allowing for this to apply in cases prior to the passing of the legislation in 2013, the Government can support or top-up insolvent pension funds in cases such as Waterford Crystal. Broadly, that is a good thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> The problem is not so much with the amendment but the whole situation, since there is a limit of 50%. This means if a pension fund does not have the assets to give people the pension entitlements they had expected, then the State will top up payments to the level of 50% of those entitlements. This is on foot of a judgment in a case taken in the United Kingdom, Robins <i>v</i>. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, in which 49% was offered. The relevant European Union directive does not specify the percentage but the complainant in the case claimed 49% was inadequate and on foot of the judgment the UK Government passed legislation which meant that the figure covered would be 89%.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> I spoke to former workers of Waterford Crystal this morning. The deal is still in negotiation. They maintain the 89% figure in the UK is far superior to what people are being given here. I made this point to the Minister earlier. She responded that the figure was 100% up to €12,000. The Minister of State or the officials can correct me but I assume the figure is 100% up to €12,000. Let us consider the example of the worker with whom I spoke this morning. His pension expectation and entitlement was €20,000 per year. The Minister said that qualifying pensioners would also get the State pension and that this makes a major difference. She suggested that the Irish State pension was far superior to the British pension and, therefore, if we total everything it is not such a bad deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> On foot of the Minister's comments I talked to the Waterford Crystal workers again. They pointed out that the judgment or the directive stated specifically that in arriving at an acceptable top-up level state pension entitlements were not to be considered and that they were irrelevant. The Waterford Crystal workers were categoric on the matter. They maintain the directive stated that the level of the State pension was irrelevant and that the case had to be judged on its own merits. Against this background 50% is rather miserable because it is only 1% above the figure deemed unacceptable in the Robins case, as against the decision in the United Kingdom where a figure of 89% has been agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> Let us remember these workers worked for 30 or 40 years while paying pension contributions in good faith and in the belief they would get a decent pension at the end of it. However, for the past six years they have been left high and dry not knowing what they will get but probably only a fraction of what they had hoped for. They maintain that the 50% figure is rather miserable compared with their legitimate expectations.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> The amendment is positive in that it maintains we can secure an agreement retrospectively. However, the 50% figure remains and the workers want the Government to be fairer and more reasonable in any deal. The decision will be taken elsewhere and I understand the negotiations are ongoing. The workers asked for that point to be made in the context of this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett. The Tánaiste is not aware of any schemes other than the scheme relating to Waterford Crystal. Deputy Boyd Barrett rightly pointed out this arrangement is under mediation at the moment. Therefore, I have no wish to comment until the mediation has been concluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> Before the break, Deputy Boyd Barrett made the point to the Tánaiste and she has undertaken some research on the matter. I will raise the point further following Deputy Boyd Barrett's contribution. I hear what he is saying but I do not wish to go into the matter too deeply because we hope that through mediation a solution can be found. I hope the Deputy will forgive me but I cannot comment further on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_509">I have another brief point. I explained to the Minister that one of the Waterford Crystal workers died this morning. A total of 20 have died since the factory closure. The Minister said their estate or entitlements in respect of pensions would probably remain, although she was a little uncertain about it. She reckoned their widows would still be entitled to these things.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> I seek two points of clarification. There is nothing we can do now for the workers themselves. It is a tragedy. Even if their spouses are entitled to whatever is finally agreed, the workers did not benefit from all those years of contributions. Furthermore, I was talking to the workers over lunchtime. They sought some assurances because the matter is still a little unclear for them. I am unsure of the details and perhaps the officials know better, but they have concerns that this will be the case and that whatever package is finally agreed, there will be no difference between what the spouse gets and what the worker would have got if he were still alive to get his pension entitlement. They are hoping they will get assurances on these matters and they were somewhat concerned that this might not be the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">I am unsure whether it is relevant but this morning the Minister made the point that it would be 100% up to €12,000 of a pension. Is that it? Is there provision for 50% over €12,000? If so these people would completely depend on the contributory pension or non-contributory pension, which would be very small and based on a means test. Is that the case? I seek clarification on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">I join Deputy Boyd Barrett in expressing sympathy to the families of those who have passed away, especially at such a period. It is always a difficult time when there is financial uncertainty. The Deputy has my commitment that I will seek clarity on the matter as soon as I can. Will he give me or the officials the name of the family? As soon as the matter becomes clear we will get correspondence to the family to allow them to know exactly what the entitlement is and how it is being treated. We will also copy the Deputy on that correspondence.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> Before Deputy Collins entered the Chamber I was explaining the position to Deputy Boyd Barrett. At this stage we hope a solution will be mediated with the Waterford Crystal pension scheme. Mediation is ongoing and I have no wish to be drawn on what percentage, where and why.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I hope the mediation is successful, satisfies both parties and gives certainty to workers and their families. I will not comment further on a mediation which is ongoing.</p>

          <p eId="para_515">That is fine. I have a question on the amendment and double insolvency. The Minister said that up to €12,000 of a pension would be 100% covered. Is there a progressively reducing percentage in cover above that threshold?</p>

          <p eId="para_517">Can the Minister of State set out the timescale to which the Government is working given the last minute manner in which these amendments were brought forward? Is it expected that a resolution is imminent? Other speakers have made the point that the State has dragged its heels incredibly in this matter. Not only have we had the situation that arises today as a result of the unfortunate death of one of the pensioners, but there have been several deaths over the past while. People have been put through the ringer due to huge uncertainty about their futures. It is very hard to take from a Government that was not prepared to put in place the protections it should have following the Robins judgment and forced very vulnerable Waterford Crystal pensioners to take legal action at considerable expense. At this late stage, can the Minister of State provide an indication that we will have a resolution shortly?</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> To respond to the point made by the Tánaiste before lunch, it is cold comfort to say to people that protections are in place now up to €12,000 and to talk about average pensions. People worked their entire lives with a reasonable expectation that they would get the pension they were promised. While 50% is better than nothing, it is cold comfort to people who had a legitimate expectation that they would be better provided for and who had been promised and guaranteed better pension provision during their retirement years. There is no more time to be lost. We need a satisfactory resolution as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_519">A number of matters arise from this. We had a motion in the House earlier, but the Minister did not answer most of the queries I put to her during that debate. She started to tell the House how many other groups would be affected and mentioned the Waterford Crystal group covers 1,774 people. The officials indicated that there were 11 schemes altogether, most of which have much smaller numbers. I understand that nine companies are involved. Those companies in which a defined benefit scheme was insolvent at the same time as the company had different agreed arrangements. Are they likely also to be able to avail of the new retrospective provisions which are being put in place? If so, has there been any attempt to work out a ballpark figure on the State's potential liability or is that a top secret given the ongoing mediation in respect of Waterford-Wedgwood pensioners and their beneficiaries?</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> I asked the Minister about the following but did not get a satisfactory answer either. Why has there been a delay? It appears today that the Government can deal with some of the issues around pensions, which is to be welcomed, but where is the money to come from? There is mention of a pensions levy, but that is thrown around every time money is needed. The pension levy is the saving grace, but that money has been committed three or four times to other projects. Will a Supplementary Estimate be required next year in the event of this legislation passing and agreement being reached with the pensioners? If it is not budgeted for and we have not seen it, it appears such an Estimate would be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> Earlier, I highlighted the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 and the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act. While the Minister said it was not necessary to make a change, it would be bad practice to fail to acknowledge that a change needs to be made to amendment No. 22. If the 2013 Act were to be amended, the Government would be dealing with the supplementary welfare allowance rather than the pensions aspect of things, which is what we are discussing.</p>

          <p eId="para_522">The Minister is asking for permission to put this motion, but unless I have missed something we have had no briefing document on it to explain how the change will impact on groups of workers. I requested to speak on this yesterday believing information would be provided. It seems we are no closer to knowing how it will affect important groups of workers. The Waterford Crystal workers are foremost in all of our minds. They are skilled craft workers who worked for 40 years in a very important company. I have not heard from the Minister or the Minister of State how the proposal will impact on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> A very simple question was asked just now about whether the family of a worker who has just died will be able to benefit from this, but I have not heard it answered. Could we get a bit of clarity?</p>

          <p eId="para_524">I will answer the last question first. The family will be entitled to what they are entitled to under the pension scheme. Whatever is dictated by the rules and regulations in the scheme is what the family and estate will be entitled to. I have been involved in pension schemes throughout my working life and different schemes involved different entitlements which would have applied for my wife and family had I passed away. Whatever is provided for in the scheme is what the family will receive. The commitment I gave to Deputy Boyd Barrett is to clarify the rules of the relevant scheme for the particular family due to the very sad situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> I jump to replies to Deputies Aengus Ó Snodaigh and Willie O'Dea with a point of clarification. They referred earlier to the reference in amendment No. 22 to the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013. The reference should, as was said, be to the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013. This correction will be made in the next version of the Bill. I thank the Deputies for bringing the point to the Tánaiste's attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> Deputy Róisín Shortall seeks clarity on when the Waterford Crystal pensions scheme mediation process will be completed. I agree that the process has taken much too long. A court case is scheduled for 13 January 2015 and it is hoped mediation will conclude before that date. That is the timetable to which the parties are operating. I hope clarity and agreement will emerge before 13 January 2015. </p>
          <p eId="para_527"> I hope I have clarified the position a little. If I have failed to answer any question, I will have the relevant issues checked and will forward further information to the Deputies. </p>
          <p eId="para_528"> When I was a child, Waterford Crystal enjoyed a worldwide reputation which it owed to its workers. I hope a fair and just settlement will be found at the end of the mediation process because this has been a difficult period for the workers. Many other Deputies and I have been in communication with members of the pensions scheme. Following receipt of correspondence from some of them, I raised the issue on numerous occasions in the House prior to my appointment as Minister of State. I will press the issue and look forward to a fair settlement being reached through mediation.</p>

          <p eId="para_529">No one wishes to deny members of the Waterford Wedgewood pensions scheme their due. However, when the House is passing legislation, Deputies should at least be provided with a ballpark figure for what costs will be involved. Governments have often got the figures wrong. In that regard, a number of Supplementary Estimates were introduced in the House earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> Earlier this year a report in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> noted the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_531">Initially, the former Waterford Crystal employees pursued a case before the Commercial Court, saying the State had failed to meet its obligations under the EU Insolvency Directive. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_532">Kevin Cardiff, then secretary general of the Department of Finance, told the court the economic crisis and bailout terms meant the Government could not commit to pay an estimated €13bn to provide a State guarantee of full pension entitlements for workers in case of employer insolvency. </p>
          <p eId="para_533">This figure was based on the potential cost of providing protection for the more than 200 defined benefit pension schemes in place at the time. This figure has since declined. In the case of Waterford Glass, the deficit in the pension fund was approximately €100 million. We were informed earlier, however, that a number of pension schemes were in place. What is the estimated cost of providing protection for the Waterford Crystal workers? Will it be €100 million, 50% of €100 million or a multiple of €100 million? </p>
          <p eId="para_534"> As the Minister of State indicated, Waterford Crystal was a prestigious company. I recall being amazed by footage showing glass blowers, molten glass and blanks at the factory. Sir Tony O'Reilly and his crew subsequently got stuck into the company and sent the blanks and everything else to the Czech Republic. The company subsequently went downhill and later amalgamated with Wedgewood as part of a failed rescue effort. In some ways, the associated companies of the owners got off scot free. This returns me to an issue we discussed in the debate on pensions legislation, namely, the practice of establishing companies for different purposes which often insulate the owners or main company from claims. Vita Cortex, the Paris Bakery and Connolly Shoes are three examples of this practice. Did this also occur in the case of Waterford Glass where the pension fund and company were insolvent and the owners remained solvent and were able to isolate themselves from any liability? As a result of this, taxpayers have been forced to pick up the tab in some ways. </p>
          <p eId="para_535"> I am not arguing against the Bill. During the debate on the 2013 Bill I argued that its provisions should be made retrospective, but I was informed that was not possible. That retrospection is being introduced today is good, but why did it take from 2007 to 2013 to start addressing defined benefit schemes? This legislation deals with schemes that fell between the cracks. Are there 11 other companies which could potentially be covered by the scheme? If so, to how many workers or pensioners would it apply? Does the figure run into the hundreds? In the case of Waterford Crystal, the number of people involved is 1,774.</p>

          <p eId="para_536">I am only aware of the claim involving the Waterford Crystal pensions scheme, but I will seek clarity and information for the Deputy. The indications from the officials present is that they, too, are aware of only one case.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> I cannot provide a figure for liabilities. Liabilities that may arise will be limited to schemes where the wind-up of a scheme took place between 25 January 2007, the date of the European Court of Justice ruling in the Robins case, and 25 December 2013, the day on which the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill was enacted. I do not have information to hand on what will be the likely cost. The amendment is necessary to enable the State to pay liabilities that arise as a result of the ongoing mediation process. As I stated, the only scheme of which I am aware involves the Waterford Crystal pensioners. We are dealing with this scheme, which is in mediation. </p>
          <p eId="para_538"> While I accept the position is very difficult for former workers of Waterford Crystal, people in Waterford will have been encouraged by the announcement a couple of weeks ago that Waterford Crystal wished to take on apprentice glass blowers. It is fantastic that the glass industry is being reborn in Waterford as the city is an unemployment black spot. It is nice that a prestige brand such as Waterford Crystal is making a comeback. </p>

          <p eId="para_543">I am very concerned by the Minister of State's reply to questions on the impact of a possible settlement on the surviving partners of deceased members of the Waterford Crystal pensions scheme. He indicated that in such circumstances surviving family members would be covered by the terms of the scheme to which the member belonged. Most of the schemes provide 50% cover for a surviving spouse and orphans, where relevant. This is not good enough, given the delays caused by the lack of a Government response to this case. The impact of the Government's failure to respond to the Waterford Crystal case has been that where the member of the pensions scheme - generally the man in a family - has died, the surviving family members have lost out considerably in financial terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> The Robins case which involved the United Kingdom and Ireland dates back more than seven years.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> Before the judgment was issued, the UK authorities responded by introducing its own pension protection scheme at a generous level. The Irish State did not respond in a similar manner. </p>
          <p eId="para_546"> Not only did it not respond to the Robins case, it has dragged its heels. The previous Government did the same. The dragging of heels and the failure to provide pension protection has resulted in a situation whereby the families involved in Waterford Crystal have been denied not just the income they would have expected if the company had not become insolvent, but the protection and income they would have expected from the Government doing the right thing at the time. The Government has not done that and that has meant that all of the families affected by the Waterford Crystal insolvency have lost out very substantially in financial terms. </p>
          <p eId="para_547"> I am particularly concerned about families of retirees who have died since the closure of the factory. It is not acceptable for a Minister to say surviving spouses will be covered by whatever terms exist in whatever scheme into which their late spouses paid. They deserve compensation from the State because of its failure to respond to this. It is now several years since the Waterford Crystal employees started the case, and it has been fought every step of the way by the State. </p>
          <p eId="para_548"> Not only that, when a decision came from the Commercial Court to refer a number of points of law to the European Court of Justice, which the Waterford Crystal staff won hands-down, the State still made no offer. Things were delayed. Unfortunately, several retirees have died in the meantime. There is an obligation on the State to provide a level of compensation to the surviving families of those who died. The response of the Minister of State is wholly inadequate. I ask him to raise this issue with the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, in the interests of justice and fairness for the families who have lost out, not only in terms of the loss of life of their family members, but in financial terms, as a result of the failure of the Government to act more swiftly in this regard. There is a very strong moral, if not legal, obligation on the State to provide compensation accordingly. </p>

          <p eId="para_549">I thank Deputy Shortall and I will raise her points with the Minister. On a point of clarification, there are rules in all pension schemes relating to what she mentioned, and of that she will be aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> In regard to her specific point on people who have passed away and lost out financially, I have been informed that is one of the items which is currently under mediation. It is to be hoped the matter will be resolved through the mediation process. I hope that addresses some of her concerns. I do not want to engage in an in-depth discussion. I am not part of the mediation process. As I have said many times, I hope we can come to a fair and just resolution through the mediation service. As I indicated, a case is scheduled for 13 January. My heart goes out to the people affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> I come from the private sector and know the importance of pension schemes. People who have worked all of their lives in the private sector know the danger of losing one's pension. Many of us in the private sector have seen our pension schemes disappear in front of our eyes. I take the same approach as Deputy Shortall. As I said, the issue is being dealt with through mediation and we have a court date. It is to be hoped this can be resolved by then. I again thank the Deputy for her contribution and will take her concerns to the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection. </p>

          <p eId="para_557">This is a repeat of an amendment I tabled on Committee Stage. I ask for a report outlining the reductions in the various social welfare payments over the past number of years to be compiled by the Minister and Department. As the Minister of State will be aware, the country has come through a horrendous recession and those who have suffered the most have been among the poorest in the country, that is, people who are forced, for one reason or another, to rely on social welfare. </p>

          <p eId="para_560">I have been told about €1.8 billion has been taken out over the past number of years. I am not seeking to make a political point. A number of groups came before the committee and a number of representative organisations approached us directly, all of whom were advancing their priorities. When talking to, listening and receiving correspondences from those groups, I noticed the extent to which the cut in the fuel allowance and the emasculation of the electricity allowance adversely affected people. Another matter which came to the fore was the cut in the respite care grant for carers. </p>
          <p eId="para_561"> A lot of research has been done by groups on the financial and human impact of the changes. Now that the economy appears to be turning around - if the Government has not declared victory prematurely - I am sure any Government would envisage that such payments would be restored gradually. I am trying to establish a mechanism for doing that in a logical manner. As I said, representative groups have done studies, surveys, etc., all of which are freely available online and to the Department. </p>
          <p eId="para_562"> I want to ensure that when the Department has money to restore the cuts, it does so in a way which matches the priorities of those affected. That is easily comprehensible from the reports and surveys bodies have done. I am trying to be of assistance to the Department. Such a report would be extremely useful for this and future Ministers in the consideration of social welfare expenditure for this budget and any administrative changes which may happen in future budgets. It would save a lot of work. I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment. </p>

          <p eId="para_567">I hope the Minister will come to the House. She might get some enlightenment on the impact of the cuts in her Department on people and how they feel about her and the Government. UNICEF recently did a survey on Ireland. I read many surveys and it is among the most shocking I have ever read. It showed that Irish families with children have lost the equivalent of ten years of progress in their income.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The child poverty rate, as measured by EUROSTAT, rose from 18% to 28% in the four years from 2008 to 2012, an increase of 10%. This means that there has been a net increase of more than 130,000 poor children in Ireland. When the Taoiseach uses the expression "the best little country in the world in which to do business," I wonder if he is looking at our rankings in these surveys. Ireland is now ranked 37th of 41 OECD countries, just ahead of Croatia, Latvia and Greece which is seen as the country that has suffered from the worst austerity in the past few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> We have seen the most disgraceful attack on provisions for young 15 to 24 year olds in the past few years and the number of young people not in education, employment or training has risen to 16%, a shocking figure. However, the question in the survey that tells us all is the one on people's perceptions. Irish families felt their lives had changed dramatically for the worse. Ireland ranked 38th of 41 countries on this question, again just ahead of Cyprus and Greece.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> Not every country has seen an increase in the level of child poverty. For example, Chile has reduced its level. Therefore, the trend is not universal. The increase in the level of child poverty here is the result of particular cuts in social welfare. For example, in 2009 the one-parent family payment was €204.30. This year it is €188, a significant loss of money for the families affected. Also, the Minister and the Government chose to reduce the upper age limit of children for whom parents could claim the allowance to seven years. Apparently, seven year olds in one-parent families can now look after themselves. All other seven year olds need supervision. What is most shocking is that the changes have been most dramatic in the case of larger families. A family with one child is now poorer by €29 in child benefit a month. A family with four children has €198 less every month, while a family with eight children has €510 less every month. That is the effect of particular cuts in social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> Unfortunately, my amendment on rent supplement was ruled out of order, but the Government continually claims it has maintained social welfare levels. The biggest outlay people in receipt of social welfare have is rent or their mortgage payment. Rent supplement was cut by an average of 28% in the years from 2009 to 2012. The Government has not responded to rising rents, leading to the homelessness we have seen which is reaching epidemic levels, something which has only come back on the agenda because of the tragic death of a man only feet from Leinster House. A family must now pay 67% more in rent than in 2009. What is the impact of all of these changes? It means worse food and clothing and a deterioration in the quality of people's lives and their prospects.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> The Minister has a question to answer about the cut in rent supplement. For example, when the cut was introduced, she said: "There will be no incidence of homelessness due to these changes." She described the change as a positive move. I disagree and contradict it. I know that the Minister does not believe anything the Socialist Party has to say, but perhaps she might believe some of what her party members have to say. Mr. Mike Allen is the director of advocacy for Focus Ireland and it is well known that he is also a member of the Labour Party, of which he is a former general secretary. He is not likely to be too critical, but he said: "Government policy on rent supplement is one of the immediate causes of the sharp rise in family homelessness." </p>
          <p eId="para_573"> There is a significant Labour Party input in Threshold also. It has spoken out about illegal top-ups, an issue with which the Government has denied there is a problem, whereby people must pay the landlord above the rent cap in order to stay in their homes. In November 2013 the Minister said that no evidence had been presented to the Department indicating widespread or systemic use of illegal top-ups. However, Threshold reported recently that it believed 75% of single parents on rent supplement had to resort to this practice and that approximately half of all families in receipt of rent supplement had to do so. People must bypass the rent caps and pay more money illegally. The Minister must conduct a survey because she has been proved wrong by people involved at the coalface who deal with homelessness. However, she persists with the cuts. It is high time to change this. If she does not change it, she should not be surprised if she is not greeted with the acclaim and the garlands she expects when visiting working class communities that have been devastated by cuts in rent allowance, child benefit, the one-parent allowance and others. Families have been devastated in the past six years, first under Fianna Fáil, but the Government has continued with the cuts. It is time for them to stop.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_574">We discussed this issue on Committee Stage when Deputy Willie O'Dea brought forward his amendment concerning the effect of reductions in payments since 2011. I remember thinking at the time that 2008 would have been a more appropriate starting point. I notice that the Deputies bringing forward amendment No. 3 have selected 2008 as their starting point. That is a key date in terms of the discussion on the full impact of social welfare cuts on society.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> The Bill we are dealing with is, in some ways, welcome because it provides for a partial restoration of child benefit. However, when seen in the full light of what has happened since 2008, this is only a pittance, given the scale of the cuts to a range of social welfare schemes. The Government has continued with the mantra that there has been no cuts to social welfare rates, but I have argued and demonstrated continuously that this is not the case. A range of cuts have been made and each one of them has impacted on those who were or were likely to be in receipt of the payments if they had remained as they were.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> I have a list of 20 measures that have been taken, but there are possibly more. I remembered another when I was reading through my list. To my knowledge, there have only been two partial changes in addressing these cuts to social welfare payments, one of which is the one before us today in the form of an increase in child benefit of €5. The other is the partial reinstatement of the Christmas bonus which the previous Government abolished. The newest one is the back to work family dividend.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">We do not have the full detail of that in front of us and it may be debated on the next social welfare Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> Given what I have said, it is important to list some of these changes, and I will try to do so as quickly as possible so as not to take up time. This is the context in which any such report would be made. It would have to take account of the previous Government's cut to the jobseeker's allowance as well as this Government's cut to the same allowance in 2014. It would take account of this Government's abolition of the €300 cost of education allowance, the abolition of the Christmas bonus under the Fianna Fáil Government and the changes to the means test for farm assist, which resulted in ineligibility for many farming families. There were also the various different cuts to child benefit under this and the previous Government, which were substantial, as well as the cuts to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which was cut in three budgets in a row by this Government - to be specific, it was cut by €50 in each of the first two years and was then eliminated for 18 to 22 year olds attending college full-time.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> The report would have to take account of the last Government's ending of the smokeless zone fuel allowance top-up and this Government's implementation of that cut, as well as the cut of six weeks fuel allowance by this Government, which amounts to €120 a year. There were cuts to the energy component parts of the household benefits package which were announced by the previous Government but introduced by the current Minister, the further cut to that package and the abolition thereafter of the telephone allowance component. There was the introduction in 2011 of a rise in the pension age in stages to 68, which would effectively see a cut of 16% in a person's pension entitlements, as well as the introduction of a tax on illness benefit from day one, when the first six weeks used to be exempt.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> The treatment benefit scheme was cut by the previous Government and then further cut by this Government and there was the cut to the redundancy rebate for employers from 60% to 15%, and then its abolition by this Government. There was the cut to rent supplement by the Fianna Fáil Government and the reduction of the maximum caps. There has since been a very partial change in that regard and a later amendment will deal with the whole question of rent supplement. We have seen the abolition of concurrent payments, which mainly affects lone parents but also many who are disabled and who benefit from CE schemes. There was then the cut of three months to jobseeker's benefit by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> Following the cut to the respite care grant of €325, my motion to try to restore that amount was, again, ruled out of order because Opposition Deputies cannot put amendments that would be likely to be a charge on the Exchequer. Hopefully, that is one of the changes the Constitutional Convention will deal with. When its report is discussed in the House, we might then have a referendum to allow us to be positive and progressive, and put forward alternatives in the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> In budget 2013 the Minister cut the household benefits package by €84. She introduced a tax on maternity benefit and then cut the payment by €32 per week. There was a cut to the rate of invalidity pension for 65 year olds by €36.80 per week, as well as the abolition of the bereavement grant, the closure of the diet supplement scheme and the massive budget cut to the exceptional needs payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> These are all cuts that need to be taken into account in the report that is being sought in amendment No. 3 or in the review Deputy O'Dea has sought in his amendment No. 2. I would prefer, in Deputy O'Dea's case, that we would look at the period since 2008 so we would know the full impact of all of the cuts and have a full understanding of how those who are most vulnerable in Irish society have been affected, given they are the people who benefit most from those schemes because they are dependent. They are the people who this Government promised in its programme for Government would be the most protected. They are the very ones who understand fully, when the Minister stands up and says the core social welfare rates have been protected, that this is not the case. The points I have listed prove undoubtedly that this is not the case and that, in fact, she went after those in receipt of social welfare harder than anybody else in our society, and they have suffered as a consequence.</p>

          <p eId="para_595">I was a little surprised earlier when, although I did not catch all she said, the Minister suggested we were not doing too badly on international comparisons when it came to poverty, or possibly poverty reduction. It would be helpful if, when she responds, the Minister repeats what she said. I was baffled by that statement because the evidence in front of our eyes, and the reports and statistics that are available to us, and that have been fairly well publicised in recent months, including since the budget, suggest we are doing extraordinarily badly in terms of the extent and level of poverty in this country. Specifically, there is very harsh criticism of this budget in terms of its failure to deal with poverty and, in some cases, its worsening of the gap between the poorest sections of our society and the better-off sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> According to Social Justice Ireland, 750,000 people are living in poverty and an extraordinary 28% of children are living in poverty, which is more than one in four. Those are shameful statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">It is not just those who are dependent on social welfare who are affected but the working poor. A total of 16% of the adults in this country with an income below the poverty line are working. The phenomenon of the working poor is rife in our country. In respect of how the budget has played into this, Social Justice Ireland points out that the rich-poor gap has widened by €499 as a result of the recent budget. The rich-poor gap is the gap between a single unemployed person and a single person on €50,000. A person on €50,000 is not super-wealthy, in my opinion, but the gap is pretty amazing. According to Social Justice Ireland, that gap between the person on the lowest income and the person on €50,000 has widened by €499 per year. Social Justice Ireland says it is a multiple of that for higher incomes and that the gap has widened even more. That is pretty extraordinary and pretty shameful.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> I addressed the Minister for Finance earlier this morning on the shocking report produced by Credit Suisse about the distribution of wealth in this country. It relates directly to this series of amendments and this discussion, because the gap is truly staggering. The report, whose base statistics are confirmed by the Central Bank of Ireland quarterly reports, shows that net household wealth in this country has increased consistently since 2009, much to the surprise of many families, I suspect. The only year it went down was 2008, which was the year of the crash. It has increased consistently from 2009 until today. Net household wealth has increased by 13%. I suspect most people would be baffled by that. How the hell can we be in a situation in which people have been hammered with income and social welfare cuts and are struggling to pay their bills, and in which we have the level of poverty I have just described, while, incredibly, the Central Bank's figures show that household wealth has increased? How does one explain that? There are more poor people, but the gross amount of wealth in the country has increased. Of course, it does not take rocket science to work out what has happened. Most people have got poorer, but a small number of people have become much richer. In other words, there has been a transfer. That is what the crisis has actually been about. It has not been about a shrinking of overall wealth in Irish society. It has been about a transfer from the poor to the rich. This is what the Credit Suisse report suggests in the very strongest terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> I invite the Minister to look at a graph that can be found on Social Justice Ireland's website. It is a pie chart showing the estimated distribution of wealth in this country. It breaks it into deciles, one of which is the poorest 10%. On the graph, one cannot even see that decile, because their share of national household wealth is so small that it does not even show up on the chart. It is 0.1% of the national wealth. The national net wealth is €508 billion. That group has 0.1% of it. The bottom 40% of households in terms of income have less than 5% of that wealth between them. One then looks at those in the top 5%, who have over 40% of that wealth. The top 10% have 58.5% of that wealth. To put that into context, over 40% of that wealth equates to just under €250 billion. There has been an extraordinary concentration of wealth in the hands of the top group at the expense of the people at the bottom. That explains the extraordinary level of poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> Against that background, one asks what the hell are we doing in social protection and what the hell are we doing in this budget to address a staggering growth in the gap between rich and poor. The poverty statistics for families, children and even working people are utterly shameful, to the extent that hundreds of thousands of people have come out on the streets begging the Government not to ask any more. They are telling it that they cannot take any more and they want fairness. The Government says it has no alternative and that it is tough and hard but these figures suggest that it is not tough or hard for a super-wealthy minority who are hoovering up the wealth literally out of the pockets of the poorest and least well-off in Irish society. The figures suggest that whatever the Government is doing in its budgets facilitates that. This goes right up to the most recent budget, which sees the gap between rich and poor growing by €499 per year, according to Social Justice Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> Is the Tánaiste aware of these critiques and statistics? What is the Government doing to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to give back to those who are struggling in order to bring about, if not equality - because that seems like a pipe dream when one looks at this stuff - then at least a reduction in the gap? What is it doing to give back to those who are suffering, struggling and barely keeping their heads above water, and in many cases, sinking below the poverty line? </p>
          <p eId="para_602"> That brings me to the final point about rent supplement and the failure of the Tánaiste and the Government to bring this into this social welfare budget. One important mechanism through which this transfer from the poor to the rich is happening is the cost of accommodation. In the past two years, rents have increased by 17% in Dublin, 8% in Cork and 7% in Galway. Rents are spiralling through the roof, but the rent supplement has been slashed and there is a refusal on the part of the Government to raise the rent caps to the levels of actual rents. If those are the levels of rent increases, the rents they are charging the people they find who can afford to pay them mean that people who own rental property are making a fortune. They are literally creaming it, so if one wants an explanation as to why we see this staggering growth in the gap between rich and poor, it is because those who own lots of property and existing wealth are using that to extract extraordinarily high levels of rent, accommodation costs and inflated property prices from those who can barely afford to put a roof over their heads. I suspect that this is one of the major conduits for the transfer from the poor to the rich. This raises the question of why the Minister for Social Protection and the social welfare budget do not take emergency measures to address that problem. It is a very serious question when one considers the levels of poverty, the crisis of homelessness and the fact that families are being driven into homelessness on a daily basis and are then unable to get out of it because of the spiralling levels of rent, the inadequate level of rent allowance and the inflexibility of community welfare officers to sanction breaches of the rent allowance cap. These are questions that are of an urgent nature, which raise the question of the morality of this budget and the entire social protection system in its failure to address these gross inequalities.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_603">I strongly support both of these amendments. The saying goes that what gets measured matters. Unless we are measuring the impact of budgets, those impacts will not matter. It is quite clear that those impacts about which we know anecdotally and from some other independent research simply do not matter to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> When the Government came into power, it promised a new open budgetary process. It spoke about ending the secrecy surrounding the budget and ensuring that all of the facts of the situation, the facts of our economy, the possibilities within a budget and the implications of those would be debated well in advance of budget day.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Unfortunately those promises, like so many others, have fallen by the wayside and, if anything, the budgetary process has become more secretive than it ever was under previous Governments. We now have four people and their advisers calling all the shots in regard to the shape of our budgets. Given the impact of the budgets of recent years, it is clear the people calling the shots on the economic management council are far removed from ordinary people's lives. If they knew anything about the real world, they would not propose or support the kind of measures we have seen in recent budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> We were promised poverty proofing but the Government does not want to see or know about the poverty impact of its budgets. It is galling for people to hear the Government boast about the fact that it has not cut basic social welfare rates. That statement is simply not true in respect of the many people over the age of 26 years who are in receipt of jobseeker's allowance. It is an insult to those people that the Government boasted their circumstances have not changed. Their circumstances have changed dramatically for the worse, and that in turn is having a huge impact on their families' income. While the basic payment may not have been cut, the majority of people in receipt of social welfare payments are suffering cuts to their family incomes in a range of areas. There was no recognition of the impact of inflation on benefits. Most of the secondary benefits have been affected by cuts, as other speakers noted. The fuel and telephone allowances and other secondary benefits have been slashed, with consequent negative impacts on household income and well-being. Furthermore, the introduction of additional prescription charges impact in particular on older people and families with children who suffer from chronic illnesses. Prescription charges are having a very negative impact on family income. The burden is being shifted onto the poorest, who are being made to pay the price of austerity. The Government has introduced a variety of new charges for waste disposal, property and water. These services had been previously funded from general taxation, which had been fairly progressive until recently, but thanks to this Government the burden of paying for basic public services has been shifted onto the shoulders of ordinary people. The progressiveness that previously existed has been lost as a result of the new charges applying to people irrespective of their ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> The cumulative impact of no increases in the basic social welfare payment, the cuts to secondary benefits, the introduction of Government charges and new charges for services that were previously funded from general taxation have been very negative for those on low and modest incomes. The Government's refusal to poverty proof its budgets means their impacts on those who are least able to pay are shrouded in secrecy. Outside agencies have to do the work the Government should be doing because whereas the Department of Social Protection previously commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to examine the impact of budgets, this no longer happens. We depend on organisations like Social Justice Ireland and international agencies like UNICEF for this information. Deputy Coppinger outlined the stark findings of the UNICEF survey on child poverty. That is a shameful legacy of the decisions taken in recent years. The survey covers the period between 2008 and 2012 but as the situation for children has deteriorated since 2012, I presume our position on the league table has dropped.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> It is galling to hear Government representatives quote old research to argue that we have a progressive taxation system. In the years up to 2012 the taxation system was becoming increasingly progressive but the reverse has been the case since then. In the context of the kind of poverty that is now exploding onto our streets, whereby many people are barely managing to keep some kind of front together despite desperate circumstances, the longer austerity continues the less they can hold things together by keeping their homes or managing their debt levels. The dam is bursting on all of that and we are now seeing the implications. It is extraordinary that, despite the myriad of social problems now affecting the country, in the first budget which allowed the Government some room for manoeuvre, it decided to cut the top rate of tax. I am not referring to people on modest incomes. The Taoiseach keeps twisting the issue to portray us as saying that people earning €40,000 or €50,000 are rich. The point is that every individual who earns more than €100,000 is being gifted €749 by the Government this year. How on earth can the Minister defend that kind of giveaway to people who, by an large, have been cushioned from the recession and austerity? This Government has decided that the priority is to give money to these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> There is a mantra from Government that everybody benefitted from the budget. That is simply not true. We know that the better off one is, the more one benefits in cash terms. Proper poverty proofing of this budget would have revealed that tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people who have incomes of less than €9,000 got nothing whatsoever from this budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">There are vast numbers of people in those circumstances. The poorest people in this country got nothing from the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> I see why the Minister is running away from this and hiding from exposing the impact of what her budgets have been doing, but she promised openness and transparency in the budgetary process. Her budgets over the past four years have brought about a situation where the gap between rich and poor has got much wider-----</p>

          <p eId="para_613">-----to the tune of €500 per year. Not only did she display her true blue colours in the last budget, in which the priority was to cut the top rate of tax and benefit the better off disproportionately and do nothing for people on low incomes, but the Taoiseach also said last week that he will continue on the path of cutting the top rate of tax. The Minister should go out into the real world and see what is happening in this country. She should see the shameful levels of poverty and the huge inequality she has increased through her measures in recent budgets, where the burden of austerity has been hugely and disproportionately placed on the shoulders of the worst off people.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> That is the reason people are up in arms about this Government and are calling for a general election. It is the reason so many people took to the streets to protest the proposed water charges. The huge anger and resentment at the unfairness of the Government runs much deeper than water charges, but that is a symbol of the general approach of this Government - to impose austerity disproportionately on the weakest and poorest sections of our society. The only way we can measure this is by using the tools that have been provided by NGOs. The Minister has a responsibility to honour the commitments she gave about opening up the budgetary process, but it appears unlikely she is prepared to do that if she is unwilling to support these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> I agree with most of the points made by previous speakers. What is happening to this country at present is quite shocking. As we approach the centenary of 1916 who would have thought we would have come the full circle?</p>

          <p eId="para_616">I support the amendments. They are very important as they reflect whether what is said by Members on this side of the House or what the Minister says is correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> The recent UNICEF report only covered up to 2013, so it does not take into account the budget cuts of 2013 and 2014. It would be interesting to see how much those two budgets have impacted on the poverty outlined in the report. The fact that a quarter of families have lost a decade of progress, according to the report, is a damning indictment of this Government continuing the budget cuts of the previous Government. That 130,000 children are living in poverty and 16% of 15 to 24 year olds are not in training or education is also a damning indictment of the Government and, in general, of the world's economies.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> The point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett about the transfer of wealth is important. It is the policies of governments that have allowed the successful transfer of wealth into the hands of the very wealthy. The Oxfam report showed that the collective wealth of the 85 richest billionaires in the world increases by $668 dollars per day. That is unbelievable. They would fit into a double decker bus. They own the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of the world's population. That situation is reflected in Ireland, where the collective wealth of the 300 wealthiest people increased by over €6 billion last year to over €70 billion. Andy Haldane, chief economist of the Bank of England, who is certainly not a rabid socialist, has said that a billionaire wealth tax of even 1.5% on the wealth of the 85 billionaires would yield $74 billion per year. I and other Members on this side of the House have made the point that even a 10% wealth tax on the more than €70 billion of the wealthiest people in this country would yield €7 billion, which could have a huge impact on dealing with some of the issues we have been discussing today.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> We have been told there is a turnabout in the economy and that it is moving forward. There was a fanfare about Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with retailers trying to get people into their shops. There were price reductions of 10% and 20%, and 40% in some shops, but it transpired that the retailers did not get the boost they expected. People do not have the money. Certain people have the money but the majority do not have surplus money to buy consumer goods, even for Christmas. Anybody who had cash last weekend would have been trying to get the Christmas presents for cheaper prices, rather than waiting to face the full cost of gifts, and trying to put food on the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> These amendments would go a long way towards looking at why that transfer of wealth is happening and how to tackle it. I assume the Tánaiste, wearing her Labour Party hat, would have to support that as well. Otherwise, I and everybody else would think that something is going on behind the scenes in order to prevent people from having transparency to see exactly what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Many points have been made about the cuts that have been imposed and I will not repeat them. However, one that has not been mentioned is the cut in maternity benefit. That had a big impact on women as their maternity benefit was cut during their maternity break from work.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> My last point is that if the Minister does not accept these amendments, it will only fuel the sense among people that something is wrong. People already feel that way, and the water tax is the straw that broke the camel's back in that regard. People just cannot take any more. They will rebel and will exercise their democratic right to go out on the streets on 10 December. They are calling for this Government to step down and let them elect a new Government that will reflect their thinking. I do not accept that we were forced to accept these measures. We could have refused to do many things. One example which I mentioned previously is the €18.1 million the Government had in its coffers at the beginning of this year. It chose to pay off the debt of €7 billion, but that could have been put into much needed services in our society rather than paying that debt. These are the issues people are watching. They are saying this Government has choices but they are making bad choices for this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_623">First, I wish to refer briefly to a matter Deputy Boyd Barrett raised this morning. I explained to him that the pension reforms we introduced to protect people's pensions in defined benefit schemes in Ireland were set at a level of €12,000 but it was 100% protection. The Deputy indicated that he believed people in Waterford Wedgewood had benefitted far more generously. I have not been able to get all of the data but I will explain my point to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Our pension protection system, while not exactly the same as in the UK, is quite strong. Bearing in mind that most defined-benefit pensioners in Ireland would also have a social welfare contributory pension and benefits package of up to €14,000, the equivalent of our PEPs regarding Waterford Wedgewood is €5,195 per year, which is less than half of the Irish figure. The average accrued benefit for deferred scheme members in January 2014 was €4,263. The provisioning in Ireland is on a significantly higher scale. The Deputy finds it difficult to believe anything good about Ireland and is full of negativity.</p>

          <p eId="para_628">From time to time, he should recognise that the Irish system is relatively generous in its social protection payments compared with many other European countries. I did not say it was perfect or that there was not a lot of room for improvements. I said it was relatively generous, including compared with many of the UK provisions the Deputy cited. I make no apology to the Deputy or anyone else for concentrating on helping to get people back to work. I do not know what has happened to the left in Ireland to make getting a job the lowest item on the agenda. While our unemployment rate is still too high and we have a long way to go, today's live register figures showed that it has fallen to 10.7%. When I took office, the unemployment figure was heading for 480,000 people, which was one of the greatest disasters the country had ever seen. Today, the figure, although still too high at just over 352,000, has decreased by almost one third. When we took office, Ireland's unemployment rate was approximately 40% above the European average; now, it is significantly below the European average. This outcome has been based on a huge amount of sacrifice by practically everybody in Irish society and it is unfair not to recognise it.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> I make no apologies for also prioritising reducing the level of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system. I have made very significant savings by helping people to return to work and reducing fraud and abuse in the system. I stand here in the interests of not only the people on social welfare but those who pay taxes, PRSI and the USC. We all know people on modest incomes contribute a lot of tax under various headings.

          <p eId="para_644">Let me take the Deputy through the changes I am happy to have been able to make in the budget. People quoted from the ESRI. The deliberate political choices the Government made to protect and maintain primary social welfare rates were not followed in other bail-out countries, some of which Deputies suggested Ireland should follow. The ESRI, among others, has acknowledged this and pointed out that, unlike in other countries, income inequality in Ireland has fallen in recent years, largely because of the overall maintenance of the social welfare system. These are not my findings, but those of the ESRI. There must be a little reflection on the true facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> On the restoration of payments in the budget for 2015, I am very pleased to be in a position to recommence the partial payment of the Christmas bonus. This started last week, is ongoing this week and will continue next week. The Christmas bonus was abolished in 2009 by the previous Government and a bonus of 25% is being paid this week to all long-term social welfare recipients including pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, long-term jobseekers and lone parents. It will be paid to more than 1.2 million people. I am happy to be able to provide for it as a start. The reintroduction of the bonus, albeit on a partial basis, and the other welfare measures announced in the budget, are real indicators of a social dividend in respect of the economic recovery and the numbers of people back in work, which makes this possible. The intention of the Government, and me as leader of the Labour Party, is to ensure the recovery is felt by all, including the people in work who pay the taxes. I look after social welfare not just for those on social welfare but for those in work who pay a lot of tax in different ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Child benefit will increase by €5 from January and will benefit more than 611,000 households with children. It will help all families with children and will have an additional benefit for unemployed families in that it is work-neutral and is retained in full whether a family is in or out of work. I am happy that people who were formerly self-employed but whose businesses have died and crashed as a result of the great recession also benefit from it. The new back-to-work family dividend will commence next year and will be available to people returning to employment or self-employment for the transitional first two years. A person who has three children will retain €90 of his or her social welfare payment per week during the first year in which he or she returns to work and 50% of that in the second year. I want to send a clear message, particularly to unemployed construction workers, many of whom are self-employed due to the way the construction industry has been operating for the past decade, that they can avail of this, as well as family income supplement, FIS.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> FIS is one of the areas for which I increased resourcing very significantly in the budget both for this year and next year. I will increase the amounts paid by very significant amounts and overhaul the ease with which people can apply for and get it and improve the IT platforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> There will also be an increase in the living alone allowance of €1.30 per week, bringing the rate to €9 per week for people living on their own. As Deputies will know, that will mainly benefit pensioners and people on a disability payment living on their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> The Independents in the House, a number of whom are present, put forward what I said was a very good motion last week on having a focus on budgetary impacts. I do not know if Deputy Boyd Barrett or Deputy Collins recalls that the first part of that motion praised the Department of Social Protection. I do not know if Deputy Shortall had an opportunity to read the motion, but I think she voted for it. It praised the Department of Social Protection for the amount of social impact analysis we do and suggested that other Departments should do the same level of social impact analysis. On behalf of the staff of the Department I was very happy to thank the Independents for that motion and for their recognition of the work the Department does with regard to social analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> Should the Deputy care to look at the Department's website, she will find our social impact analysis there in full. The Deputy seemed to doubt that detailed social impact studies had been done by the Department. They are done regularly by the Department and published in full. They cannot be published in full prior to the budget because the various budget rates, as the Deputy will know as a former member of the Government, are not confirmed until the day of the budget when the Minister for Finance stands up in the House. If the Deputy wishes I will send her copies of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> The social inclusion division of my Department, which is recognised nationally and internationally for its analysis work, is the staff of the Combat Poverty Agency. When I became a Minister I was delighted to take these people, who have enormous experience and expertise with regard to poverty measurement, into the Department of Social Protection.</p>

          <p eId="para_653">Deputy Shortall may even know some of the staff involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> This is the first budget in which we have had scope to make positive but modest progress for welfare recipients. That is evidenced by the €65 million we are spending on the bonus for pensioners as well as the €198 million of new welfare improvements that I announced in the budget, which I mentioned to the Deputy, such as child benefit and improvements in the living alone allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> We are using the economic dividend from the recovery so far to invest in sustainable growth for families and communities and in vital public services. It is hoped that with the continuing improvement of economic conditions, further resources will be freed up for future budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> Social transfers, which is another issue Deputies spoke about, play a crucial role in redistributing resources to those people most in need. During the years of the economic crisis from 2009 to date, social transfers have reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate. Deputy Boyd Barrett asked me the measure I referenced. It is called the at-risk-of-poverty rate and is an internationally accepted measure. Social transfers have reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate by an average of 60%. That is ten percentage points more than in the years preceding the crisis, at the height of the boom from 2005 to 2008. This shows the increased effectiveness of social transfers in protecting the people who are the most vulnerable during the economic crisis, and this has been accepted internationally. Those are not my figures. Those are the figures provided internationally and by national organisations looking at budgetary impacts.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> All I ask from the Deputies is to be fair in terms of their analysis, but also to recognise progress in areas such as the number of people returning to work and the significant impact of returning to work when one or two adults in a household go into employment, by and large after a period of time, stop receiving social welfare payments and begin to pay some tax, whether it is the universal social charge, USC, PRSI or income tax. In terms of what has been a payment by the State and everybody in work who contributes their taxes, that individual becomes a contributor, but also becomes financially independent, with all the bonuses that result for the individual and their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> Social impact assessment is an evidence-based methodology to estimate the likely distributed effects of policy proposals on poverty and social inequality, including the impact on family types, life cycle groups, and gender. The Department undertakes a rigorous and extensive impact assessment of welfare policy changes before the budget. The Department has published integrated social impact assessments of budgets 2013 and 2014 using the ESRI SWITCH model, which included the main welfare and tax measures. To be clear, they are available on the Department's website, and if anyone has any difficulty accessing them we will be delighted to send them hard copies.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> The Department is currently preparing a social impact assessment of the main welfare tax and related measures for 2015. This will be finalised to take account of Government decisions relating to the water charges, the water conservation grant, and some other measures, which I will detail shortly while explaining to Deputies what is and is not in the SWITCH analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> The Government has committed to carrying out a social impact assessment of the main taxation and welfare measures before the publishing of budgets by a cross-departmental body led by the Departments of Finance, Social Protection, and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> Many Deputies spoke about taxation, but they may not have noticed some of the tax changes. Deputies spoke about income tax, but they should take into account the significant changes made to the USC. First, the entry point for USC was raised from €10,000 to €12,000, affecting, as I am sure Deputy Shortall would agree, the people on the lowest levels of income. That has lifted 80,000 people out of the USC net. The Deputy will recall that in the first budget presented by this Government, 310,000 people were lifted out of the USC net, which I remember the Deputy strongly favoured. That has happened again this time. Second, the two lowest rates of USC have decreased by 0.5 of a percentage point each, which is important for people on a very low income.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> Most analysts would agree that one of the key issues to be faced in tax reform in Ireland is the point at which people enter the higher rate of tax. For a single person, that is around the average industrial wage, €34,000, and it is a little more for a couple. We have widened the band for an individual by €1,000 and for a couple by €2,000. That is a start. These are modest but important changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> Third, we have reduced the overall rate of the top level of taxation from 41% to 40%.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">Alongside this - I do not know if Deputies caught this during the budget discussions - we raised the rate of USC for those on very high incomes. To only look at income tax measures and not USC is to narrow the analysis in a way that gives a distorted picture. The whole package must be looked at. It is targeted at people in work with families earning somewhere between €30,000 and €70,000. Members are shaking their heads in denial, but as well as helping people who rely on social welfare income, it is an important part of a policy on economic stimuli and recovery to give people in work with families in the low and middle income categories, whether it be €30,000 or €70,000, a benefit in terms of the taxes they have to pay.</p>

          <p eId="para_668">I disagree with the Deputy and think she is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> The SWITCH analysis is a list of comparators over a period of time for different groups on different levels of income. The SWITCH analysis in Ireland does not capture where people, in receipt of a social welfare income or otherwise, have medical cards. Deputy Willie O'Dea knows that a medical card is a very valuable resource for people in receipt of social welfare payments and those in work on a low income. The SWITCH model does not include this information because it is a particular kind of comparator, nor does it include information on general overall investment. For example, next year I am delighted to say we will employ 1,700 additional teachers at primary and secondary level, including 360 SNAs and 400 resource teachers. Without a doubt, this will lead to a significant betterment of educational provision in schools, with the continuing programme of investment in building new schools, with which no doubt Deputy Ruth Coppinger is familiar in Dublin West. A huge number of new schools have been built by the Government, which has done two things. People are back to work in building schools and there is an enormous bonus for the children in education at all stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> The second major investment is in the biggest social housing programme in a generation. I am so pleased that we have been able to do this in the budget. For various reasons, the previous Government - I acknowledge that many policymakers advised it - turned away from the provision of social housing through building to relying excessively and exclusively on the private housing market and landlords. This emphasis was mistaken and the return to investment in appropriate social housing clusters, including on infill and greenfield sites, will be extremely welcome. Socially, it is one of the best decisions taken by the Government in the budget. Although it is an investment over three years of €3.3 billion, it is not captured by the SWITCH analysis. All Members agree that investment in housing will produce a major bonus for the families who require housing and those returning to work, but it is not captured by the current analysis of who benefits from what.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> The other significant investment in the budget is in the health system, with the health sector receiving a significant allocation this year and next year. This is extremely welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett raised the issue of rent supplement. The Department of Social Protection provides homes for 72,000 people. Therefore, it is one of the largest providers of homes for people in the country. As Minister in that Department, I have prioritised and I am proud to continue to prioritise the issue. In the year to date, 19,000 rent supplement payments have been introduced or renewed. It represents almost one quarter of the rent supplement stock. We work very efficiently and effectively at local level to provide homes for 72,000 families in areas of choice, generally in privately owned houses in private estates.</p>

          <p eId="para_673">The Department does not provide any; this is unbelievable.</p>

          <p eId="para_674">That is an important addition to housing provision in the State, at a cost of €340 million. It has a drawback, however, which is that if someone is in receipt of rent supplement and finds a job, he or she may end up losing the rent supplement payment. For the past three years we have concentrated on reforming the rent supplement scheme in order that, over a period, it will transfer to local authorities under the housing assistance payment scheme. At that point, if people find a job, the matter will be assessed on a differential rent basis and it will no longer be an employment trap.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> The community welfare service and its officers have discretion to increase or change rent supplement amounts. They exercise this discretion strongly and in great detail on behalf of the clients with whom they work. They take their job very seriously. If Deputies are aware of families who are having difficulty, I strongly advise that as well as advising them to visit the local council, they should advise them to go to the community welfare service. We are spending €244 million of taxpayers' funds, paid for from our taxes, on the payment of rent supplement. There has been no decrease in the allocation for rent supplement payments in the budget and in the year to date 19,000 households, almost one quarter of the total, have had a rent supplement payment initiated, renewed or reviewed successfully.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> In addition, given the difficulties in the Dublin city area, we have a protocol with Threshold. Since its introduction in June, we have successfully housed, renewed and provided rent supplement for 250 families. Almost no one has been turned down under the arrangements made with various housing agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">Last Friday I was in Cork launching the Cork Simon Community's annual report. Again, I pay tribute to the community welfare service which works with all agencies and non-governmental organisations at local level in helping those with housing difficulties, as well as with specific organisations such as the Simon Community which works with people who are sleeping rough or, for one reason or another, have become homeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> I take the opportunity to offer my condolences to the family, friends and community of Mr. Jonathan Corrie who died several days ago. I know many people who knew him personally and spoke very highly of him. It was a sad and regrettable death. As Members are aware, Mr. Corrie had a certain amount of contact from time to time with various housing services. While we do not know the detailed circumstances of the case, I offer my condolences to his family and friends.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> The Government’s policy is to end homelessness by 2016. As such, more funding has been provided to deal with the issue than in any other country in Europe. The funding to be allocated next year has been increased by 25%.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> I hope Deputies opposite will take note of some of the facts in the budget. It is the first in which we have been able to provide for a modest stimulus package of improvements in social welfare payments and reductions in taxation and USC, universal social charge, aimed at low and middle income individuals and families. We also have a major commitment to large-scale social housing investment, investment in the building of more schools and educational facilities, the employment of more teachers, as well as increased spending on health services, with supplementary funding this year and over €600 million extra next year. The budget will be seen to have significantly addressed the issue of spreading the benefits of the recovery around the country to as many individuals and families as possible.</p>

Those in work are contrasted with those on social welfare payments. It is the old divisive tactic in the Chamber, which is absolutely disgraceful. Social welfare is generally designed for people who are not in work. Those on social welfare payments also pay taxes and paid them before they landed in the social welfare system. The Minister’s attempt to divide the two categories does not go down very well.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">What does the Minister mean? Persons in receipt of social welfare payments must find their own place to live and then have to try to claim a portion of the rent through rent supplement. The Minister used the words, “We provide homes for people.” The Department does not provide homes in the private rented sector for persons in receipt of rent supplement. The Minister knows of people in Dublin West who have gone to highest person in her office who could not find homes. There are no homes to be found for those in receipt of rent supplement. The Minister has no greater ability than anyone else to find housing. People have to source their own accommodation and then make a claim. It is incredible what the Minister has just claimed.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> The reason the Government must undertake the largest housing programme in a generation is it did not build houses for five years and now we have the worst housing emergency for more than a generation. The Government has not moved away from reliance on the private rental sector. Up to two thirds of the homes envisaged in its new housing strategy will be provided by the so-called private sector. Up to 30,000 units will be built by councils, while the other 70,000 will be sourced from landlords, under the rental accommodation scheme and the housing assistance payment scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_689">I will give the Minister four facts in response to what she has just said. First, many tens of thousands of people on the lowest incomes received nothing whatsoever in the budget. The very many people on the minimum wage benefited to the tune of €176 per year. If they are hit with water charges or decide to pay them, the vast bulk of it will be wiped out, leaving them with only €16 in the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> Unlike people on the minimum wage or the lowest incomes, those earning in excess of €100,000 a year - the wealthiest - are being given a gift of €750 a year as a result of the budget. The approximate cost of that measure is €75 million. If the Minister thinks that is fair and should be a priority in terms of Government expenditure, I am not sure in what parallel universe she is living.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> Sometime at the end of next year, the Department of Social Protection will issue cheques of €100 to every household under the so-called water conservation grant scheme. This is another prime example of measures implemented by the Government that take no heed whatsoever of people’s ability to pay and which are utterly regressive, in so far as this is a measure that will cost everyone the same, irrespective of income. That is an appalling vista. The Department will send €100 to every household in the country, irrespective of their circumstances. If the Minister believes that it is a priority for the Government to gift €75 million to those who are best-off in the country, she is utterly out of touch.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">These two amendments seek reports on the cumulative effects of social welfare cuts, not the cumulative effects of tax cuts, a matter for the Minister for Finance, or those who have managed to get back to work. Thankfully, there are many going back to work, but it must be remembered that 500,000 young people who could have contributed to our society have emigrated. There are many others who are dependent on social welfare, the most vulnerable in our society, who were referred to in the programme for Government as the least well-off.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">People in receipt of disability allowance often care for others, but the respite care grant has been cut. Workers have benefitted from child and maternity benefits and they may have been unfortunate enough to have had to depend on jobseeker's allowance at some point, but all of these payments have been cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> The country has experienced extreme circumstances and the Minister presumes that those who are totally dependent upon social welfare payments will try to avail of exceptional needs payments due to the cuts I listed. Whenever a new cut is made or a new tax imposed the Minister trots out the line that these people can avail of exceptional needs payments through the supplementary welfare system. Last year exceptional needs payments totalled €69.4 million and this year the figure is expected to be in the region of €31 million. The amount has fallen substantially, and this has not occurred because the cumulative effect of cuts has lowered the need for payments - it has fallen simply because the budget was cut. The Minister ignored this fact in her contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_699">The Minister threw around many red herrings, and that is not a serious way to conduct a debate. She suggested that we do not care about people finding employment; she cannot be serious. We all want to help people get back to work, but there is a serious argument suggesting that the poorest people in society, those depending on social welfare and the working poor, have disproportionately taken the impact of cuts and austerity in recent years and have done so again in the budget. Against this background, significant tax breaks were given to people who, frankly, are not struggling to pay the bills or a keep a roof over their heads. It is legitimate to pose questions on this, particularly when the people in question earn over €70,000, and say the measures are not reasonable. Everyone in this House wants to help people get back to work, but we have serious questions about some of the back-to-work schemes and the low-paid work they can entail. Notwithstanding the fact that there will be differences of opinion in the course of this debate, I ask that the Government be serious in response to questions that are raised by Deputies and reputable non-governmental organisations, NGOs, such as Social Justice Ireland and UNICEF. These questions relate to chronic levels of child poverty, poverty generally, poverty among the working poor and the obvious related matters of homelessness, the housing crisis and rent supplement.</p>

          <p eId="para_703">I will first give the officials an opportunity to obtain the information on a publication date. Deputy O'Dea knows of the significant forum that took place. Various groups contributed to the changes in the budget - they highlighted the issue of the re-establishment of the Christmas bonus and matters relating to child benefit and the living alone allowance. Deputy O'Dea met these groups, as did I, but the economy is fragile.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> I accept Deputy Boyd Barrett's point because we are all interested in the same thing, though we may approach it in different ways. The Deputy has a different view from mine in some respects, and we will always have that disagreement, but I accept that the vast majority of Deputies are interested in getting people back to work. A job with a fair day's pay for a fair day's work is the best way out of poverty. I will work hard over the next 14 to 15 months to get as many long-term unemployed people as possible back to work through schemes that have been quite successful, such as JobsPlus, which grew significantly in the last budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_717">We are going over some of the same ground, but it is an important area and I have some additional points to make in light of the Minister's responses to points made earlier on this side of the House. I appreciate the words spoken by the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, as they mean we can dispense with red herrings about who wants to get people back to work. We all want to get people back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> Many similar points have been made on this side of the House on the issue of whether we are taking sufficient action on dealing with poverty. Did the last budget take sufficient action on dealing with poverty? We must address the chronic levels of poverty we face and the growing gap between the rich and poor. As Deputy Coppinger said, there was something implicit in the Tánaiste's response to our points. The Tánaiste implied there was a choice between, on one hand, giving people an incentive to go back to work and assisting those who earn between €30,000 and €50,000 and, on the other hand, being more generous in dealing with poverty reduction for those dependent on social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">That is implicit in what the Minister said. One could construe it as divide and rule, but let us suppose that is not the case. Either way, I do not accept that we should set these two things off against one another. In many cases we are referring to the same families, in which one person is working and another is not and may be dependent on social welfare. Therefore, I do not buy the distinction, nor do I believe it is an appropriate comparison.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> The comparison that many of us are making relates to the benefits that have emerged from the latest and most recent budget. The give-backs to people on earnings of €60,000, €70,000, €80,000, €100,000 and more have been multiples of those that have gone to people on the lowest incomes and on what we might describe as the incomes of the working poor or those on the average industrial wage. What those earning less than €36,000, which is the average industrial wage, got back right down to the people at the lowest levels of income, was either negligible or a small fraction of what went back to people on incomes of €60,000, €70,000, €80,000, €100,000 and more. In a situation where those on the lowest incomes are living in poverty, is that fair, just or legitimate? Many of us maintain it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> It is not a question of us being disingenuous and it is important to state as much because this is set out in the Budget Statement. I will advert to the examples given by the Minister for Finance which set out the position clearly:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_722">John is single and working full time on the minimum wage. John will see a gain of €173 in his annual net income due to this Budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Further on the document states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_724">Laurna is single, no children and self-employed with income of €120,000 per annum. She pays a pension contribution of 5% of her gross income. She will see an annual gain of €687 due to this Budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">This is directly from the Budget Statement. Someone on €120,000 gets €687 more while someone on the minimum wage gets €173 more. How can one say it is fair when the person on €173 is in the poverty statistics? These people are the working poor. How can this possibly be justified?</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> I refer again to Social Justice Ireland and the examples in its budget critique. Social Justice Ireland maintains that a single person who is unemployed got back 90 cent per week in this budget, but a single person on €75,000 got back €14.30. The person on €75,000 got 14 times more in his weekly pay packet or income than the person who is unemployed. The critique states that an unemployed couple got back €1.51 per week, a total of €78.52 per year, whereas a couple with two earners on €125,000 will get an extra €23.57 per week or €1,225 per year, several multiples of the increases for those on the lowest incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> We seriously question this. The Minister asked whether we noticed the 1% extra on the universal social charge for those earning over €100,000. We did notice it. The rumour was that the 1% figure was a panic measure brought in on the Monday after 100,000 people took to the streets on the Saturday. Had that 1% not been introduced, the multiplier for those earning over €100,000 would have been through the roof. The measure curtailed the gap somewhat.</p>

          <p eId="para_731">They attack us too. Anyway, there were reports to that effect. Even if we accept that it was a legitimate attempt to curtail the disproportionate benefits that might accrue to the people earning in excess of €100,000 per year that would have resulted from cutting the top rate of tax, it did not do enough in that regard because the people earning over €70,000 and certainly those earning over €100,000 and €125,000 still got multiples of what was given to people who are on the poverty line, the working poor and those on or under the average industrial wage. That is not fair. Arguably, it would not be fair under any circumstances but it is most certainly not fair when we know that the coterie of people between the average industrial wage and those on the poverty line cannot pay their bills at the moment. They are struggling to pay their bills. They are making cruel choices between which bills to pay, paying off debts and trying to keep a roof over their heads, although in many cases they are unable to put a roof over their heads, resulting in a disastrous housing and homelessness crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> There are other things; it is not only about income tax. When we are considering social protection we should examine other measures in the budget, although they are often treated separately. A total of €95 million was given in corporate tax breaks. In the context of the overall arithmetic of the budget it does not seem like much, but €95 million would have meant a great deal to the people on social welfare or the working poor in terms of providing a greater give-back rather than giving more corporate tax breaks to people who already pay some of the lowest levels of tax on profits anywhere in the advanced industrial world. How do we justify that? These are serious questions that we must answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> All of this is following the changes between 2008 and 2015, when those dependent on social welfare lost 12.5% of their income and the working poor lost 11.3% of their income. I still do not fully understand the Minister's reference to statistics indicating how we are doing okay on the international poverty comparisons. I simply do not get it. I suppose the Minister is getting her figures somewhere and I imagine they are from reputable organisations, but UNICEF and Social Justice Ireland are reputable too and they are not making it up. I am keen to know how these things square up. UNICEF stated that 28% of the children in this country are living in poverty. Is UNICEF wrong? Is this true or not true? My experience and the empirical evidence - I doubt if the experience of the Minister of State is much different given his constituency with Pearse Street, Ringsend, the south inner city and so on - suggests many people are in deep trouble. The term "poverty" is no exaggeration to describe the situation that many people are in. They are unable to cope, they do not know whether they can afford a roof over their heads. All of these things are realities and the UNICEF statistics seem to bear them out.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> Another important point in the UNICEF report is that despite the global recession some countries have actually reduced child poverty while other countries have not. Shamefully, according to UNICEF, we are in the group that has not and I would like an explanation for that. Some 18 countries have seen a reduction in child poverty since 2008 while there were increases in child poverty in the remaining 23 countries analysed. We are among the remaining group of 23 countries. This is what UNICEF has said. Has UNICEF got it wrong? If that is what the Government maintains and if it believes the UNICEF statement is not true then I would like to hear it. The research also shows that the proportion of children up to the age of 17 years living in jobless households nearly doubled in Portugal and Spain. The corresponding figure almost tripled in Denmark, but the largest absolute increases of above 5% were in Ireland, Bulgaria, Greece and Spain. We are in the worst place in terms of the international league table when it comes to child poverty and failing to reduce it. In fact we are seeing it increase along with the number of young people living in jobless households.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">All of these things have deteriorated while, notwithstanding the recession, other countries have managed to insulate the poorest sections of society from the economic damage. That is presumably because they have put the costs a little bit more on those that could actually afford them. That is the conclusion I draw.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> I do not expect the Minister or Minister of State to comment in detail on the proposal now, but I expect them to take it seriously at least when there are reports showing a staggering concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny group of people. I would like to hear from the Government, but in particular from the Labour Party, that this will be given serious consideration in the context of a report that shows 5% of the population have more than 40% of the wealth, or close to €250 billion. This is from the Credit Suisse global wealth report produced in April 2014. The Minister should look at this shocking report. I acknowledge that these are estimates, but they are very credible ones produced by a wealth asset management company with an interest in knowing where wealth is, how much countries have and how it is distributed in order to punt the information to wealthy investors around the world. The people who produced the global wealth report tend to try to obtain the best and most accurate information and have detailed their methodology in the foreword.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> The figures show that the staggering wealth inequality here is on a par with what is happening in most of the rest of the advanced industrial world. These staggering gaps in the distribution of wealth are consistent across the advanced industrial countries. It is a shame not just for Ireland but for the whole world that one can have this concentration of wealth. Anyone who is interested in equality, social protection, fairness and all that kind of stuff must take this seriously and address it and not tell us that it is too complicated to find out where the wealth is. The Department of Social Protection will really put someone through the ringer when it comes to means testing but it appears things are different when it comes to the wealthy.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> My final point is on rent supplement and all the rest of it. The Minister says the Government has moved from a failed position of outsourcing and privatising the provision of social and affordable housing as pursued over recent years - vigorously so by Fianna Fáil with disastrous consequences. Fianna Fáil effectively privatised the housing market and we went from a situation where in the 1950s and 1960s a very significant proportion of any housing built in any one year was built by the State. That meant there was an adequate stock of affordable subsidised housing while acting as a regulatory ballast on the overall housing market. That continued until the 1970s and was abandoned in the Thatcherite era of the 1980s with disastrous consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> The privatisation of the housing market led to the bubble because it put all the control in the hands of developers and banks who did not give a damn about affordability, the stability of the housing market and the provision of social housing. There is no doubt that the neo-liberals in the last Government and around the world pursued that with disastrous consequences. People should be honest about this stuff. When the current Government took office in 2011, it decided to continue down the same road and produced a document in July that year which stated that the direct provision of social housing was a thing of the past. It said we would not do it any more and that stuff would be outsourced. The document was produced by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. I remember putting out a press statement at the time to say it was a disaster. The idea of HAPS was already in the pipeline in that document. While the term "HAPS" was not used, a reference was made to a move to housing support as opposed to direct housing provision as the Government said it did not have the money to build social housing any more.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> This has led to the claim the Minister just made when she said that her Department provides 70,000 homes. This is a ludicrous claim, but it follows from a policy set out in 2011 and still pursued through the HAP scheme which is saying that housing assistance payments and recategorising people on rent allowance is the same as providing them with a council house. That is not going to fly. The Minister of State knows that. If the Minister and Minister of State wanted to argue that they could not do anything else as the scale of the problem is too difficult, it would at least be an honest answer. I would not accept it, but it would at least be honest. To say that a housing assistance payment or rent allowance is the provision of a home is not correct, however. It is not the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> It is not secure and there is no pathway to be able to buy the house in the end. One is at the prey of a landlord who can pull out of a HAPS or RAS agreement at any time. There is a range of differences in terms of responsibility for maintenance and the demarcation lines between landlords, tenants and the local authorities. There is a whole range of problems. If this is what we are now describing as social housing, the quality of it will be lower, there will be major problems in terms of maintenance and we will be prey to landlords and market rents. It is not the same and it is not the answer and we should not pretend otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> It sounds good on the face of it to refer to 110,000 social housing units being provided by 2020, but 75,000 of those are referable to the reclassification of people currently on rent allowance who will stay exactly where they are in the private rented sector if landlords will sign up. Many landlords will not, which is a problem we will discover in a year or two. In relation to the other 35,000 units, we have not had a breakdown. We know it will be a mixture of public private partnership arrangements, leasing arrangements, refurbishments and some direct builds. How much and by who? Will it be the voluntary housing associations? How much will be leasing arrangements and what are these public private partnerships? How do we know they will be different from the public private partnerships that collapsed the last time? How do we know they will not be worse? There is a great deal of detail which we have not even had a chance to discuss here.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> There is also the issue of the rent caps. Since the Government's document was published, we have not had a debate on that, which I find a bit odd. The Taoiseach indicated that after the housing forum tomorrow there might be a discussion of the matter next week. I hope that can be confirmed and that we will find out the detail and have a chance to go through this stuff. I am not happy with it nor are many of the housing agencies.</p>

          <p eId="para_745">I am sorry to go on but these points must be made. The last time rent caps were reviewed, they were increased by 9%. Since then, rents have gone up by 17% in Dublin. The caps are very far behind the curve. Nobody could seriously suggest, given the gap between the 9% increase in the cap and a 17% increase in rents since, that this is not contributing directly to the homelessness and housing crisis. It self-evidently is. I do not understand why we have been fobbed off with a review when the evidence is piling up.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> As far as the crisis was concerned, we were repeatedly promised a review, but we did not get it. We then get the situation I have referred to with community welfare officers. While I appreciate that the Minister of State came over to me yesterday when he heard about the particular case and said "We will see what we can do", I cannot understand why there cannot be a general instruction to community welfare officers pending a review of the wider policy to sanction any payment where there is a legitimate claim that will keep someone in a house and prevent them becoming homeless. It is very easy for welfare officers to check if claims are legitimate. If someone comes in and says the only place he or she can find costs €2,000 per month while <i>www.daft.ie</i> shows that there are places available for €1,200, the community welfare officer can say "Come off it. Go and find somewhere for €1,200". If someone comes in and says the only available place costs €1,200, the community welfare officer only needs a computer to confirm on <i>www.daft.ie</i> whether that is all that is available in the area at that price. If he or she concludes that it is, he or she should just sign the cheque. That would prevent a great many people becoming homeless at Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_748">Yes. I will relate the tale of two families whom I have met in the course of campaigning against the water charges. The reason both families have become involved in the campaign is not only the introduction of water charges, however worrying having to pay water bills will be for many people, but also the dramatic cuts in child benefit the Government has introduced since taking power. The other night, the woman in the first family, which has seven children, told me she started her Christmas shopping last February. As we know, parents are killing each other to get their hands on dolls based on a character from the film, "Frozen". Fortunately, she snapped up one of these dolls last February and has been storing it ever since. Two of her children have serious medical conditions and, as the Minister of State will be aware, these tend to eat up family incomes. The family is not in receipt of social welfare as the father works 80 hours per week in two jobs, one during the day in a factory and the second at night. I checked the changes made to child benefit rates in recent years. In 2008, a family with seven children would have received €1,347 per month in child benefit. This figure fell to €1,155 in 2011 and in 2012, under the current Minister, it was cut again to €1,068 per month. It currently stands at €910 per month. As such, the family in question is worse off by almost €500 per month, which is a large amount of money. The Minister of State should consider how much suffering these changes have caused.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> The second family I have met in my campaign is from Jobstown, an area that has recently attracted the interest of the media which have never shown any interest in west Tallaght or any other working class area. While I do not propose to provide many details as I do not wish to reveal identities, the family has a large mortgage and relies on food vouchers or food stamps, as they are known in the United States. The food voucher system here is administered by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. The woman must send her children to the food bank, which, incidentally, is on the grounds of An Cosán, to get the food the family needs to survive each week. </p>
          <p eId="para_750"> I understand the Minister recently opened a food bank in Cork.</p>

          <p eId="para_752">No, I am referring to the senior Minister. What I mean by a food bank is a place people visit to process food vouchers. These facilities are springing up all over the country because poverty is increasing dramatically. Recently, the Government attempted to tell people we are experiencing a fabulous recovery. After the budget, it expected everybody would be well disposed towards it and recognise that sacrifices had been made. It then slapped a water charge on them, which brought matters to a head. The only recovery under way is among the 1% at the top whose income has increased by 12% since 2010. While some of us have been suffering in recent years, this group has been doing very well, thank you very much. The Government had choices, including the option of trying to get hold of some of this wealth, but turned its face against making them. If it had introduced a 5% wealth tax on assets valued in excess of €1 million, it could have generated almost €3 billion. There is an incredible amount of wealth at the top of society, although I accept it would be difficult to get hold of some of it because one in eight of the very wealthy are tax exiles - the likes of Bono and Denis O'Brien - who live abroad. Nevertheless, I am sure if members of the Government put their minds to it, they could access this wealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> The Government could also have increased tax on the top 10% of earners or examined the bogeyman of corporation tax. In the past when others and I advocated increasing corporation tax the Fianna Fáil Party argued that our proposals would drive jobs out of the economy. This argument no longer washes because people know the country is being used as a tax haven. </p>
          <p eId="para_754"> My amendment proposes that a study be done on the impact of recent cuts, particularly in respect payments to families with children.</p>

          <p eId="para_759">The senior Minister spoke about the large number of people who, thankfully, are returning to work. One of the key issues facing society is that many of those returning to work are joining the working poor and returning to short-term contracts and low paid work. I am not making this up. The figures show that many of the jobs being created pay lower wages than was previously the case. The proof is the fact that the Department had to increase the funding available for family income supplement. While it is positive that the State is stepping in to supplement incomes, that such a large number of people in employment will be dependent on the family income supplement is a negative development. This increase in funding for family income supplement is a recognition that wages are low in many cases and many employees are on part-time and, in some cases, zero hour contracts.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> It is accepted that social welfare payments are the minimum required for people to survive, yet many people cannot survive on these payments. I listed a range of cuts introduced since 2008, all of which have impacted on those in receipt of social welfare payments and many workers. In my previous contribution, I also referred to the cut in funding for exceptional needs payments. The equivalent of €30 million has disappeared from that allocation on the basis that eligibility for these types of payment has been tightened to such a degree that most of those who were able to avail of a payment in the past can no longer do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_761"> Before addressing the amendments on child poverty and lone parents, the issue of rent supplement was raised in the context of poverty. Every Deputy is aware of cases involving people who are in receipt of rent supplement and must pay a top-up to their landlord over and above the sum they are required to pay as part of the rent allowance conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">In the past the Minister denied it happened because I suggested it was the landlords who were operating illegally. There was a reason. The Department turned a blind eye to it because there was no way it could house so many people, even on the old scale rent supplement rates of two or three years ago, without allowing people to use some of their funding. Let us not forget that the social welfare payment is the minimum amount required to survive. People were taking some of that and topping up payments to landlords who then did not declare it and, therefore, were not fully tax compliant.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> The cap on rent allowance means one cannot rent a flat or house in the city for a monthly rent of over €950. The vast majority of people who are renting at that figure are also topping up their payments, and I can guarantee the rates have increased because the average rent for a three bedroom house in my area has jumped from €1,200 two years ago to €1,400 today. That means anybody in receipt of rent allowance who has had to sign a new lease in recent months has quite a brilliant landlord or is making an under-the-counter payment. That is the only way people are managing to keep a roof over their heads.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> That does not take into account all of the families who are trying to make ends meet. It also does not take into account the fact that some of those who are not able to avail of rent allowance are families who are then put up by homeless agencies in bed and breakfast, hotel or some type of hostel accommodation. Thankfully, there is some availability. We can debate the suitability of many such situations, but this is not the time nor the place to do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_765"> We had a debate a number of weeks ago on homelessness, and we may have one next week. Some of those living on the streets are there because of the conditions and chaos in some hostel accommodation, which are such that they would prefer to sleep on the streets. That is an indictment of the quality and standards of such accommodation. It is not suitable for families, people in recovery or those who are severely depressed. We need to address these issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_766"> Recently, many people who were in receipt of rent allowance but could not renew their leases and were squeezed out, because their landlords decided to sell or refurbish in order to make more money, have ended up in homeless accommodation. Families, often with young children, are affected. Children may be enrolled in schools in specific locations. Some families have been housed in airport hotels. I know of one such family who have been living in an airport hotel for a number of months. The mother had to gather her belongings on a Friday morning and check with reception whether she could stay for the weekend. She had a car and her tax was still in date, but the last time I spoke to her it was about to expire and she had no money to pay for it. She had to drive from the hotel to the west of the city to bring her children to school. There was no extra funding-----</p>

          <p eId="para_769">All of the money to enable that women to drive a car back and forth across the city comes from a social welfare payment which is supposed to sustain her in a stable position. It does not, it cannot and it was never meant for that. It is an example of the hidden poverty we are seeing.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> People cannot afford clothing and can no longer ask community welfare officers for clothing grants because such requests are refused point blank. The system may have changed for a very good reason - namely, because grants were being given for communion clothes - but the problem is that community welfare officers wiped out the grant across the board. Only in very rare cases can people get grants for clothing, such as if one's house burns down. </p>
          <p eId="para_771"> The Minister made a major play about getting many people back to work. One of the significant restrictions on people returning to work, especially lone parents, is the cost of child care. Nothing has be done to provide the affordable Scandinavian model of child care that the Minister promised when she made major cuts to lone parent payments. I mentioned all of these points in my contribution on Second Stage. One-parent families are those most at risk of poverty. They are not my figures; rather, they are consistent from any investigation into lone parent families. They have the highest rate of consistent poverty, yet their payments were cut. </p>
          <p eId="para_772"> I note the Minister's earlier declaration that she hopes to increase the Christmas bonus next year. The problem is that it is a once-off payment at one time of the year. People would prefer to receive a weekly increase when they need the money. The bonus is welcome, but it does not deal with weekly bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> As I said, I will not rehash all of the points on lone parents and child poverty. The Minister was quite condescending when she told us we had ignored all of those who were returning to work. However, others did not and will not find work. Some gave up work to save the State money by caring for a loved one, and the thanks they got from the Minister was a €325 cut in the respite care grant, which placed some in more impoverished circumstances. </p>
          <p eId="para_774"> These amendments are reasonable and would not impose a major cost on the State, but would set out the full effects of the range of measures since 2008. Such effects include the well-being of children, dealt with in amendment No. 7, and the impact on one-parent families and their levels of poverty, dealt with in amendment No. 17. Those cohorts are not likely to be significantly affected by any changes in the budget or the Bill because the measures are minimal in comparison to the list of over 20 measures that have had an impact on the least well-off in our society which I read earlier.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_775">As everything has been said, I will just make a few brief points. I am looking forward to the publication of the Government's impact assessment of tax and social welfare changes. What period this will cover, I do not know or care, provided it gives a comprehensive account of what we want measured and gives an indication of the priorities for changes in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> There is no doubt that the cuts in child benefit have had a severe impact because of the cost of child care. When in government, we introduced substantial increases in child benefit which were designed to help people to meet the cost of child care. In retrospect, it was a mistake to do it in that way, for a variety of reasons that I will not go into now. The cuts have made child care even more unaffordable.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> The rent caps have been an unmitigated disaster. I have experience of the issues involved from dealing with constituents on a daily basis. The caps are responsible for a situation where thousands of children and their parents are living in unsuitable accommodation, in hotel rooms, hostels and bed and breakfast accommodation, etc., because they can no longer afford to pay private sector rents which can no longer be supported by rent allowance because of the caps. I do not suggest that if the cap was raised, the Government would have to pay an amount proportionate to the new cap. The cap could be raised, but we could keep the same maximum level of support or allowance. This would save many of the people who are on the margin. Another impact of the rent caps has been that they have driven people into the most unsuitable accommodation. The caps are forcing many people in my city to live in kips.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> It is said the problem is not money, but I believe money it is. It is the issue in raising the rent caps. I do not accept for one moment that if we were to raise them, rents would automatically increase. This is not like the grant for new houses which builders supposedly added on to the price automatically. This is a situation where the market demands a certain rent, but the State states it cannot support people in paying that rent, if it is above a certain amount, despite the fact that rents are rising substantially. If the Government meets its €2.2 billion commitment for the provision of more housing in the next so many years, that will exert downward pressure on rents. </p>
          <p eId="para_779"> On lone parents, I welcome the amendment introduced on Committee Stage to prevent the erosion of the amount a lone parent can earn and still qualify for lone parent's allowance. In my experience, significant numbers of lone parents - probably the majority - are working in low paid or part-time employment. The Minister states a centrepiece of Government policy is to encourage people to go out to work. If we look at the changes being made such as the reduction in the age to 14 years which means that once a child reaches 14 years the lone parent must transfer to jobseeker's allowance, they mean that a lone parent will earn less because the means test for jobseeker's allowance is more rigid than that for lone parent's allowance. All the reduction in the amount a lone parent can earn - down to €90 per week - has done is place lone parents who work, and only them, at a disadvantage. If a lone parent wants to stay at home or he or she is on jobseeker's allowances and stays at home, the rate is the same. The impact is on a lone parent who is working. I find it peculiar for the Government to state it can encourage people to go out to work by reducing the financial benefit in doing so. That seems a contradiction in terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> I look forward to the Government's impact statement and hope it will bring these matters to light and inform Government policy in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_781">I thank the Deputy for his balanced contribution. The Government is committed to carrying out a social impact assessment of the main taxation-welfare measures before publication of the budget. This will be carried out by the cross-departmental body led by the Departments of Finance, Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform. Like the Deputy, I look forward to it being done quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> In response to Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, on the figure of 1%, it was not a panic measure but a control mechanism. What we were trying to do - the Deputy will disagree and say we have not done so - was to give some tax relief to low and middle income families. However, we disagree on that point. </p>
          <p eId="para_783"> On the particular instance mentioned by the Deputy regarding housing, I have asked housing officers to look into it. I am happy that the Deputy has brought the particular case to our attention. I want to ensure officers use discretion and brought to their attention some weeks ago the discretionary powers available to them as set out in the legislation. I want to see these powers being used throughout the city in a fair and equitable manner. If there are blips and officers in some areas are operating with discretion, while others are not, I want to ensure this does not continue and that discretion is used throughout the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> I do not want to rehash the discussion that took place before I came into the Chamber and will just deal with issues the Tánaiste did not raise. </p>
          <p eId="para_785"> Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh raised a concern about people coming back into the workforce losing out, zero hours contracts and low pay. One of the first changes the Government made when it came to power was to reinstate the minimum wage. The Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, is addressing the issue of contracts and wages and will do so quickly. We want to ensure abuses in the system are removed. The Minister of State is already involved in consultation on the issues involved and we will see him roll out quickly in the new year the fair pay commission which is urgently required. We all have anecdotal evidence of what is or is not happening, but the Minister of State will deal with the substantive issue early next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett asked if the Government had taken on board any of the suggestions made in the UN report. It adopted a key recommendation made in the report to make an explicit commitment to end child poverty by setting a child poverty sub-target in April 2014 which will lift over 70,000 children out of poverty by 2020. I could go back over the documentation and who said what, but that would not be constructive as the issue has been rehashed in the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_789">I will just make a brief comment. When the Government came to power in 2011, money was not available. A house building programme is planned, for which €2.8 billion is provided. It includes direct provision accommodation provided by local authorities and involvement of the voluntary sector. The HAP scheme also has a role to play. However, I want to see the voluntary housing sector and local authorities provide the bulk of housing and for it to be rolled out by 2020. The Deputy can raise the matter again with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1039">I move amendment No. 9:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1040">In page 4, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1041">"<b>Amendment of Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005</b></p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1042">3. Section 290(3)(c) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 is amended by the insertion of “the Parish of the Travelling People or any credit union for the purposes of the Lough Payment Scheme, or” before “any other body that may be prescribed". ".</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage. It is a simple one which would give effect to a guaranteed loan scheme that was in place previously. The scheme which had been developed with MABS was quite successful in addressing particular problems in paying loans, fines and even rent arising from nomadic nature of the Traveller community. In the past Travellers were able to have loan repayments deducted from their social welfare payments. The amendment would correct an unintended consequence of changes to the social welfare payments system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> The National Traveller Money Advice and Budgeting Service, NTMABS, has worked with a number of clients since the scheme was first put in place. Originally known as the household budget scheme, it was facilitated by An Post in partnership with the Department of Social Protection and offered a facility to pay local authority rents and utility companies such as Bord Gáis. It then became known as the Lough scheme because of the involvement of Lough Credit Union and was extended to facilitate additional creditors. In September the NTMABS published a report on the scheme which found that 25 MABS offices supported more than 400 clients in paying debts via the scheme. Examples of debts repaid through the scheme included credit union loans, Garda fines and court fines. In one case three debtors owed up to €20,000. It was also possible to pay private landlords through the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> With the discontinuation of the scheme, those who would otherwise avail of it have nowhere to turn other than family members who are often in a similar predicament, or illegal loan sharks. The stability provided through the scheme ensured some people who had previously faced major financial troubles would no longer have to face such situations. For example, Clann Credo, Dublin City Council and Wicklow County Council supported a number of MABS clients in accessing loans for families who needed to replace their caravans. This was an important facility because these families had been turned down on the open financial market, not necessarily because they were bad debtors but because their nomadic lifestyle meant they could not meet the criteria for accessing loans from financial institutions. Many families relied on loans provided through the scheme to pay for new homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> When I tabled the amendment on Committee Stage, the Minister indicated that she was prepared to consider it. Is she still prepared to consider the amendment or another version of it, either now or when the Bill goes to the Seanad, or at the very least can she give a commitment that the issue will be addressed in the next Social Welfare Bill which is due in February? I have introduced the amendment now because this is the time of the year when many people with limited finances - not just Travellers - turn to illegal moneylenders to buy Christmas presents or simply to pay their fuel bills. I ask the Minister to accept my amendment to give a legal basis to the Lough payments scheme to enable it to continue in the run-up to Christmas. I also hope it can be further developed in the years to come to give a greater role to credit unions and MABS, not only for the Traveller community but also all those who until now have had to turn to illegal moneylenders who are a scourge on working class communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">We should do what we can to interfere with that scourge. That is the logic behind the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> When the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, came to my constituency to launch a report for the Dublin 10 MABS group in the civic centre in Ballyfermot, some of the representatives of National Traveller MABS who were present raised this issue with him. He was not hostile to the idea, but I do not know if he managed to take any action to give effect in some way to the intention of my amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1049">I thank the Deputy for tabling the amendment. I do not propose to accept it for the reasons I outlined on the last occasion, but the Deputy makes a fair point and I share his concerns. I have asked for the issue to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> It would not be appropriate to insert it in legislation because, essentially, it is an administrative arrangement. It might be more difficult and constraining than intended if it was dealt with in legislation. However, I will revert to the Deputy on it. A new overall chief executive has been appointed to the CIB and MABS and I will ask them to examine this issue. Facilitating people, on EasyPay, in a range of payments is the best way of managing their money. We also must be careful not to take too much of their money; therefore, a balance must be struck, certainly at this time of the year. We have good facilities with An Post and the Deputy will recall that we reviewed the legislation relating to household budgeting to make it more effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> Of the 500 people the Deputy referenced, 300 have found other mechanisms to address their method of payment and been accommodated. They include, principally, people going on the household budget scheme, using An Post <i>mybills.ie</i>, BillPay, PostPoint, Payzone and PayPoint which are available in local shops. A total of 100 people are being actively assisted by MABS to transition to an alternative bill paying service. MABS is examining potential solutions for the remainder or families, who number less than 100.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052"> While I thank the Deputy for the amendment, it should not be incorporated into the Bill. However, I agree with him on this issue and his proposals and share his concerns around it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1053">I thank the Minister for agreeing to examine the issue. Perhaps there might be a report from both the CIB and MABS. The Minister referred to the chief executive, but it should be from those who are directly working with them. They managed to find other arrangements, but the initial service was in place for them. Perhaps it might be extended because there is a difficulty. If there is not an easy pay facility, many find it difficult to make the decisions to pay this or that loan. A person might pay his or her heating bill, but it might be more important in terms of his or her credit worthiness to pay for the caravan and what that entails. I am not making these decisions. Others make the very hard decisions to put food on the table or heat their home, rather than pay a mortgage or a loan such as this. All we are trying to do with a facility such as this is to make it easier to pay and also to be mindful of not putting somebody into extreme poverty. That is part of helping people to manage what little income they have.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> I will withdraw the amendment in the hope the issue can be addressed either in legislation or through some other mechanism to allow the spirit of the Lough payment to continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1055">I move amendment No. 10:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1056">In page 4, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1057">
            <b>“Amendment of Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1058"><b>3. </b>The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 is amended by inserting the following after subsection (4) of section 311:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1059">“(5) (a) An Appeals Officer shall decide an appeal within a prescribed time of 60 working days from the date of receipt of the appeal.</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1060">(b) Where notice of a decision under section 311 is not given to the appellant who made the appeal concerned before the expiration of the period specified in section 311(5)(a), a decision upholding the appeal shall be deemed to have been made upon such expiration.</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1061">(c) An Appeals Officer may apply to the Chief Appeals Officer for an extension of time to consider the appeal in exceptional circumstances but the Appeals Officer must demonstrate the reasons for the delay and the appellant shall be informed of the reasons for the delay in writing.”.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">We discussed this issue at length on Committee Stage and I do not propose to go over the same ground again. The Minister's main objection to accepting the amendment appeared to be that the UK system of appeals was far more inflexible than that in the Irish system and that I was trying to import all of the inflexibility of the UK system into the Irish system. I am not. I accept the Irish system with all of its attendant flexibility. I am trying to make one change to that system, namely, that there be an end date for an appeal in order that people who, in more than 50% of cases according to the latest statistics, have been wrongly refused social welfare would know there was a date by which their appeal would have to be decided. In addition, their public representatives, whom they consistently ask about these matters, might be able to advise them accordingly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelGrealishPD" eId="spk_394">
          <from>Deputy Noel Grealish<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1063">I support the amendment which would require social welfare appeals to be decided within 60 working days of receipt and that this could only be extended in exceptional cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064"> The main issue dealt with in my constituency office each day is social welfare. This takes the form of advice on payments, assisting with applications and assistance with appeals. On social welfare appeals it is taking five months for a summary decision to be made and seven months in cases in which an oral hearing must be held. This is the average waiting time, but in many cases decisions take much longer. Given that 50% of cases appealed are successful and that the success rate is even higher when an oral hearing takes place, this delay is unacceptable. Unfortunately, while some people can qualify for supplementary welfare allowance while an appeal is being processed, in other cases it is not possible, perhaps owing to family circumstances. That leaves people suffering financially while awaiting a decision on their case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> In my experience, the majority of applications for certain payments, for example, carer's allowance, disability allowance, domiciliary care allowance and invalidity pension, are refused by the Department of Social Protection, with the decision subsequently being overturned by the appeals office. In some cases, applications are refused, despite comprehensive medical evidence supporting them. There should be greater transparency in how the initial decision is reached by the Department. All of the payments I mentioned relate to the physical or mental illnesses of individuals or close family members and initial refusal of these payments is a source of huge stress and anguish.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066"> I wish to refer to a specific case involving domiciliary care allowance, a payment for a child with a severe disability who requires care and attention substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age. When the allowance is refused, it can delay a family in being able to purchase extra resources or services for a child with complex needs. My office recently dealt with a case in which a family had two children who needed care. The application was constantly refused by the Department, despite numerous appeals. As a last resort, we had to contact the Taoiseach's office which, in turn, contacted the Minister's office. Eventually the case was resolved, but the anguish and distress caused for the family were unacceptable. We should not have to go to the Taoiseach's office to get a decision by the Department overturned. If the family was entitled to the payment, they should have received it in the first place. They should not have been obliged to go through that experience. It took almost one year to resolve the matter. Then, when we contacted the Department in March, we were told the oral hearing would be held in October. It was wrong that the family suffered such distress and hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">The fact that there is no set time for dealing with appeals adds to the stress caused by the initial refusal, especially for families who are struggling to cope with a recent diagnosis and the care of sick child.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068"> An oral hearing should be a mandatory part of the appeals process, rather than at the discretion of the Social Welfare Appeals Office. Appeals have a better success rate when an oral hearing takes place. It is much easier to overcome misunderstandings about cases and incorrect assumptions about an individual when he or she has an opportunity to explain the case to an appeals officer in person. The complex nature of the applications process for social welfare entitlements can be daunting and difficult, particularly for older people or those who are unfamiliar with the social welfare system, and without assistance these applications can often end in failure. People must be afforded an opportunity to explain their cases verbally in order that they can correct decisions and ensure they are not left without vital and appropriate payments because they are not apt at completing the application form. Putting a 60 day limit on the waiting time for an appeal and a decision to be made, unless there are exceptional circumstances, would greatly improve the appeals process and help to address the stress and anguish faced by those who are refused vital social welfare entitlements.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_395">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1069">On Committee Stage, I raised a number of concerns about waiting lists in the Social Welfare Appeals Office. While I sympathise with Deputy Willie O’Dea's amendment, I do not know whether it would fully address the predicament. However, it might force the Department to address a major problem. Most of the delays are associated with health related allowances. Some of them could be addressed in the first instance, before going to appeal. In this regard, on Committee Stage I made a number of practical suggestions to the Minister. Others also made suggestions on Committee Stage and I hope they will be taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070"> More work needs to be done at the initial stage; for example, if an item is missing from an application form, a telephone call could resolve the issue. A telephone call might cost 30 or 40 cent, whereas an appeal or a review would cost much more. I have highlighted the letter of rejection of a social welfare application and the Department is considering the matter. The letter should be clearer about what a review stands for. Most of the public who have dealt with the Department of Social Protection have some understanding of what a social welfare appeal is and it seems to be the first port of call for many when they see a rejection of an application for an allowance to which they believe and, in many cases, are entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071"> I do not know whether the number of medically related social welfare applications that are rejected and subsequently upheld on appeal has changed much in the past six months, but it is one of the biggest scandals. The fact that 50% of appeals are upheld suggests the initial work was not done properly or that the files were incomplete when they were submitted to the Department. One of the problems is that people making such an application are often waiting for medical documentation. Therefore, if would be helpful to improve the speed at which consultants and hospital medical departments produce the required letters and statements. It cannot be impossible for consultants to share documentation required for the Department of Social Protection, with the applicant's permission, via e-mail. This would allow the medical assessors in the Department to quickly see the full impact, rather than a cursory note which is often illegible and might name the condition but not the restrictions it places on the applicant's life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072"> Some of the applications I see rejected are in cases in which people apply for invalidity pension, whereas they would be much better off applying for disability allowance, for which there is a much lower threshold. To receive invalidity pension, people must prove that they are unlikely ever to return to work and they do not understand the difference. When a person makes an initial application for invalidity pension, the deciding officer might be able to explain to the applicant that while he or she may not be entitled to it, he or she may be entitled to disability allowance. The applicant might withdraw the application for invalidity pension on that basis and apply for it subsequently, if his or her condition continues and is likely to continue, while in receipt of disability benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073"> Those of us who have constituency offices in areas in which there is a high dependency on social welfare know that there is frustration when we have to tell people that if they apply for a social welfare appeal, they will have to wait five to six months, whereas a review will happen much sooner. While I have encouraged more people to use the review facility, sometimes they do not have the documentation required and it can take a while to gather all of it. The system could work much better and address the long waiting list much faster.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_396" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1074">Again, we had a very detailed and lengthy discussion about this issue on Committee Stage. I have pointed out that while having a fixed period sounds very attractive on the surface, in practice our system is rooted in the fact that we allow constant reviews and the input of new information. A very good feature of the Irish system is that if there is more or better information available, that we allow all of it to be input and that we allow constant reviews, even after a negative decision on appeal has been made. This is a very important area for the Department. My officials have a project under way to review persons in receipt of disability benefit who should receive invalidity pension, which is a little opposite to what Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh said. Just as many people apply incorrectly for invalidity pension, although there is a strong possibility that they may return to work, there are those in receipt of disability benefit who would be better off receiving invalidity pension. We are examining internal review processes to see if we can identify such persons and offer them whatever is the best option, given their conditions. The new IT system has made much of this possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075"> The other difficulty we have is the huge increase in the volume of applications. We have improved the IT system, but, understandably in the context of the recession, huge additional numbers have been applying for social protection payments. As people begin to go back to work, thankfully in increasing numbers, it is likely that the volumes will begin to taper off, but it has been an enormous challenge. We have put a great deal of investment into upgrading the IT system, but the best way to improve outcomes is by having better quality information at all stages of the process because a general letter of support from a doctor is not what is required. It has to be specific. Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh has said it can take people time to get consultants to produce reports, but we allow these reports to be sent in. For instance, in the case of difficulties in respect of domiciliary care allowance raised by many Deputies for children with severe behavioural difficulties in some instances and also for children on the autism or Asperger's syndrome spectrum, we have revamped the system to give people much more time to take into account the fact that they may have to wait for an appointment to see a consultant and obtain a letter. We are constantly seeking to improve the system and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076"> My own view is that having a fixed time limit would not be helpful. I strongly believe Deputies would be back here quickly to ask for it to be lifted because inevitably it would stop the constant review process that we allow in the Irish system as opposed to that in the system in the United Kingdom. I recognise that the Deputies have concerns, but we are constantly reviewing the information we give people. I have said previously that we spend approximately €47 million on Citizens Information and the Money Advice and Budgetary Service and it is important that we have a greater level of advertising of the availability of this information. Also, as we move to have work on all of the Intreo offices finished by the end of the year or the beginning of next year, I hope we will have much better points of information and direct telephone helplines available for individuals. Alternatively, if they go to the general reception desk in the Intreo office, they can have a word about the type of application they may wish to make or be referred to their local Citizens Information centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077"> I do not propose to accept the amendment, but I will come back to the Deputies on the issue. At the committee I referred to the significant reductions that had been made in waiting times as a result of the new IT system and I hope we will continue to improve on these times.</p>

          <p eId="para_1078">I recognise the fact that waiting times have shortened, but five months is still a long time, especially if one has a case wrongly decided. Seven months is even longer and these are the average periods, as Deputy Noel Grealish said. I could cite for the Minister a number of cases with which I am dealing in which it is taking considerably longer than these waiting periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079"> I am unconvinced by the Minister's response. She has advanced the same irrelevant argument as she did on Committee Stage, namely, that if a time limit was imposed and we were to make an exception for exceptional circumstances which we are trying to do in an effort to be reasonable, we would in some way import all of the inflexibility inherent in the British system. When I interrupted the Minister to say that was not what I wanted, she said she would explain it to Deputy Noel Grealish because he was not present at the committee. This is peculiar to say the least. What is the point in repeating an irrelevant argument to him?</p>
          <p eId="para_1080"> I agree with the current system with all of the flexibility it offers and which allows a person to submit the medical evidence whenever one receives it before an appeal is decided. I just want to bring some certainty to those who are waiting, many of whom have been waiting for longer than five months or even seven months. We should be in a position to tell them that if there is an appeal which could take several months to process, it must be decided within a certain number of months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081"> The Minister is saying we are very fortunate in having the current system in terms of the flexibility it offers, etc. That is like saying the longer it continues, the better it is because people will keep finding pieces of evidence, medical reports and further information that might suit them and that, therefore, we should have a never-ending process until eventually we find something in ten years time that will enable them to succeed and that we will not have a decision until then. I am pressing the amendment because I find the Minister's logic unconvincing to say the least.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1089">I move amendment No. 18:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1090">In page 4, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1091">
            <b>“Non-Contributory State Pension</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1092"><b>4. </b>The Minister for Social Protection shall review the impact of the closure or significant deterioration in the value of defined benefit pension schemes on expenditure on the State Pension (non-contributory) and produce a strategy to prevent further closures or decline in value so that the State’s exposure is reduced and pensioners’ incomes are protected.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">I will speak to the group of amendments tabled. On amendment No. 18, this was a mechanism I was used to trying to have debated because when other Members and members of the select sub-committee tried to raise the issue of the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS, it was ruled out of order on the grounds that the Bill was not dealing with pensions, but, of course, it is because the Minister has so decided. The point I am making in amendment No. 18 is that in general terms the less protection the State provides for defined benefit schemes the greater the potential cost to it because if people do not receive their promised defined benefit pensions for one reason or another, because a company is in a position to walk away from its commitments, this will have a knock-on impact on their potential entitlement to a State pension and these costs will be transferred to the State. That is the point of my amendment. It is worthwhile considering the prospect that the State should review the impact of the closure of or a significant deterioration in the value of defined benefit pension schemes on State expenditure and the implications of this for the future cost of non-contributory pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> The main thrust of the amendments is to address the situation in which so many deferred and current pensioners find themselves under the IASS. They are former Aer Lingus, Dublin Airport Authority and SR Technics staff who were in what they understood to be secure, pensionable employment in one of the State companies. The contract provided for a defined benefits pension at a particular level. In good faith they spent years working for a company and paid into that pension scheme, with a legitimate expectation that the company would honour its pension commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> Since the 1990s, when both companies were trying to shed staff, various programmes were introduced and staff were encouraged to take early retirement and leave the company as deferred pensioners. Many came under pressure and those who opted to leave did so on the clear understanding that their pension rights would be preserved and that, on reaching pension age, they would be guaranteed the pension they were promised when taking up employment. Many of them have been in touch with me. All of the people concerned have contracts, whereby, when they opted to accept one of the exit packages, they were given a clear commitment in writing from the company that their pension rights would be preserved and that they would be guaranteed a certain level of pension on reaching pension age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096"> Earlier we talked about double insolvency in the case of Waterford Crystal pensioners and the need to ensure the State provided pension security for them. The figure of 50% was used. Companies that are successful, rather than insolvent, but with insolvent pension schemes are allowed to walk away from pension commitments made to their staff as a result of the 2009 Act which was copperfastened by last year's Act. If any Member of the House was told that, having worked the required term to secure full pension rights, at the stroke of a pen his or her pension would be cut by 40% to 60%, there would be uproar and no Minister would contemplate doing it. In the case of any group of public sector workers such as teachers, let us imagine the reaction if teachers were told that, on reaching retirement age, their pensions were going to be cut by 50% or 60%. People would have taken to the streets long ago and there would be a revolution, but that is exactly what is happening to deferred pensioners under the IASS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097"> There is now less protection for people in schemes of companies where there was no issue with solvency than for those facing double insolvency. The Minister spoke about a guarantee in respect of pensions of up to €11,000 or €12,000, with the average private sector pension being €10,000, but that is of no comfort to those who had an expectation that they would receive a certain level of pension which has been wiped away. We are seeing this more and more in the IASS companies and across the private sector. Pensioners are being sold down the Swanee in terms of undertakings or guarantees they understood they had. Where there is a deficit in a pensions scheme, a company can shrug its shoulders and walk away and the State says it is okay. That is outrageous and if the principle was applied to the public sector, there would be uproar. If there is a deficit in a defined benefit pensions scheme, it should be treated as a debt on the company. There is no reason that should not be the case. It remains with the company which should be required to meet its commitments to staff over a number of years. I cannot see the rationale for not requiring successful and solvent companies not to pay their debts in the same way as others. We dealt this issue in the legislation last December and I cannot see how, in the Minister's eyes, it is acceptable for companies in a healthy position to simply walk away and leave former employees high and dry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098"> What is happening to the deferred members of the IASS is a disgrace and the failure of successive Governments to legislate to prevent companies from reneging on pension promises has led to this sorry state of affairs where future and existing pensioners stand to lose existing pension benefits. Last year there was an opportunity to do something about the matter, but it was not taken. The terms of reference of the expert panel set up to examine it and the process by which the panel engaged with the unions and companies concerned have resulted in recommendations on additional payments being targeted primarily to benefit existing employees. Existing employees are represented, while existing pensioners are protected to the level of 90% in some cases and less in others. That is a sore point for many. But the ones who have lost out to the greatest extent are deferred pensioners who do not have a voice. There is no right of appeal; they have been completely discarded; their rights have been trampled on and they are left in appalling situations where retirement income will be a fraction of what was expected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099"> The manner in which the expert panel approached this issue and its terms of reference were inadequate. It seems that the interests of deferred members have not been adequately taken into consideration. There is a requirement to have due regard to the interests of different categories of member, but there is no evidence that this has happened in the case of deferred members. It was incumbent on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to examine the matter and be satisfied that all parties had been given due regard, but it is quite clear that did not happen. Before the panel reported to him and before he saw the recommendations, he replied to parliamentary questions saying he intended to sign the orders. He pre-empted the outcome of the process. A couple of weeks ago, when the deferred members met the Minister for Social Protection to express their grave concerns about their future, they felt it had been a successful meeting and that they had received a fair hearing. As the Taoiseach told us, later that day the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport consulted the Minister for Social Protection and signed the orders. Deferred members have every right to feel aggrieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100"> The Government had plenty of opportunities to provide a political solution, which is what is required. By any standard, the deferred pensioners have been unfairly treated. They did not receive an adequate hearing and have not been adequately considered in the report of the expert panel. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport appears to be quite happy to support the expert panel in so doing, which position was endorsed by the entire Cabinet. The people in question have been sold down the Swanee and left with no option but to take legal action. They have contracts and signed undertakings from their respective companies outlining their pension entitlements. Although it took a very long time for it to come around, we saw that legal action was required by the Waterford Crystal workers to get any movement on the part of the Government in their case. Regrettably, it seems that the members of the IASS, the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, have been put in exactly the same position and the same action will have to be contemplated. It is regrettable that the State is standing idly by, saying it is fair game to treat in this manner pensioners who had a legitimate expectation that they would have their pension commitments honoured by the Dublin Airport Authority, which is still a semi-State company, and Aer Lingus, in which the State is a significant shareholder. It is also wrong to sell them down the Swanee when the companies concerned are in a healthy state and could afford to meet the pension commitments they made. It is regrettable that the Minister is not taking a more proactive role in upholding these pensioners’ rights. Even at this late stage, I appeal to her to do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_406">
          <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1101">Amendment No. 18 is interesting in that it highlights the fact that the more people lose their pensions under defined benefit pension schemes, the more it will cost the State. With respect, there is an even larger problem. I have said before that the country’s demography with an increased dependency ratio of 2:1 by the middle of the century means the State will not be able to sustain the State old age pension system at the same level as it currently exists. Accordingly, it is incumbent upon us to encourage people to provide for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102"> One of the ways that can be done is to make defined benefit pension schemes attractive again. To do that, the Government will have to restore confidence in the system which has been utterly eroded. People’s experience is that they can suddenly be informed a scheme will be wound up and get a fraction of what they were led to expect. I have met various pension scheme groups with their members in absolute despair because they had planned their retirement on a certain income level but were suddenly told, through no fault of their own, that they would only get a fraction of that. That is not fair or just.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103"> Amendment No. 19 seeks to ensure a solvent firm that runs a defined benefit pension scheme cannot throw its hands in air claiming it is too much of a costly inconvenience, close it down and destroy people’s futures unless it is funded to at least 90% so that its members will at least get 90% of what they were expecting after paying into the scheme over many years. That is not an unreasonable demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104"> If the Government refuses to accept this amendment, it is effectively stating, no matter how wealthy or well-financed a firm is and no matter what little justification there is to shut down the scheme, it is okay to do so at a whim, leaving all its unfortunate workers stranded. I would not expect a Government composed partly of the Labour Party to stand over such a situation. That is not the situation that pertains in the United Kingdom and should not be the situation that pertains here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105"> Amendment No. 20 simply provides that if the trustees of a pension scheme make a decision with which any or all of the pensioners are unhappy, there should be some form of an appeals mechanism. What is wrong with such a proposal? There is an appeals mechanism to the courts anyway. Why should people be put to the hassle and expense of going through that particular lottery, however? Why can there not be some independent appeals mechanism? I have dealt with workers involved with defined benefit pension schemes for many years. They see the trustees as being associated with the company, not them. There has to be some independent and inexpensive mechanism to enable them to get a second opinion as to whether they have been treated fairly or otherwise. That is not an unreasonable demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106"> Again, if the Government decides to refuse this amendment, it is stating the members of a defined benefit pension scheme have no right or entitlement to expect an independent appeals mechanism on a decision by the scheme’s trustees, even if their pensions will be wiped out by the decision. That is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107"> All Members have had representations from the IASS Deferred Pensioners Action Group, members of which have been treated in an appalling and indefensible fashion. They had no say in the decision to reduce their pensions and were outvoted by members who will be suffering a lot less and, therefore, in whose interest it was to make them take the hit. There is no appeals mechanism. The Minister signed the order from so-called expert panel. It seems to me to have been a ready-up from start to finish. A whole group of pensioners who contributed to a scheme with a legitimate expectation that they would have a certain level of income in retirement will now only have a fraction of it. That is not fair, just or defensible. Even at this late stage, will the Government reconsider its position on this particular matter?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_407">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1108">This is a serious issue for those who for many years paid into a pension fund on the understanding that when they retired they would have a certain amount as it was a defined benefit pension scheme. It would have been laid out day one to them when they started employment, be it at 16 or 50, if they paid into the scheme they would enjoy a certain amount in a pension at the end. Obviously, the impact of the world economic crisis has put a major strain on many of these schemes. When we debated the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013, the Minister alluded to the substantial decline in the number of defined benefit schemes over the past several years. Some of this was due to the fact the schemes and their companies had become insolvent. In some cases, employers took the opportunity to force a different scheme upon their workers which was not as beneficial to the employees in the end but was to the company in some way. There has been a move away from defined benefit pension schemes to defined contribution schemes. Most people may not be aware of the substantial financial implications of such a move when they retire.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">We had a discussion and the Minister produced legislation that was passed with a specific priority order, in terms of insolvent schemes and companies. That does not apply to what has been raised here so far. Concerns have been raised about how the IASS trustees looked at the pension scheme and how the actuarial figures were reached. We have been told there is a hole of €780 million in the IASS pension scheme and that is no small sum. Obviously there are implications for workers' pensions but another actuarial company could come up with a different figure that might be higher or lower. We are dealing with guesstimates that take the long view on potential increases in wages and the cost of living over 20 or 30 years. Future salaries are often overstated, though they may be understated. Liabilities and fund deficits were all considered when calculating the figure of €780 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110"> We are talking about a company that competes in a global market but has turned its back on commitments to past, present and future employees. The company is trying to extract itself from something it thinks will impact on its ability to grow, rather than impact on its ability to live up to commitments to workers. I still wonder whether the State has a policy of encouraging a move towards defined contribution, DC, schemes rather than defined benefit, DB, schemes. If this is a policy it is a regrettable one; if it is not, the State must protect those in DB schemes. That is the nub of this argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111"> The IASS has around 15,000 members and this number divides three ways. Some 5,000 members receive a pension, 5,000 are deferred members and 5,000 or more are active members. If the State has encouraged DB schemes to date, it has a commitment to these people, especially as we are talking about a semi-State company. The commitment is greater in the case of a semi-State company than a private company. The State must live up to commitments that were made in writing to workers by companies acting on behalf of shareholders, a major one of which was the State during those years. The State cannot extract itself now on the basis that this is a commercial decision without consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112"> Unions, trustees, Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus all have a say in this - the Minister has a say as she signed an order. However, some 5,000 deferred members do not have a say in this - one third of the beneficiaries of the IASS DB scheme. These people do not have the same right to fair procedures as others, though the right to fair procedures is recognised in law. A person who is denied fair procedures is entitled to an appeal - this was upheld time and again by the then Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly. The reports over the years show that she encouraged appeals methods to be put in place but deferred members do not have such a mechanism. Decisions are made on behalf of deferred members and they have no input or ability to raise questions - it is a <i>fait accompli</i>. Trustees ride roughshod over deferred members. I raised the question of deferred members when we discussed the last Bill and there must be a mechanism to protect them and give them a right of appeal. It is right that there should be a right of consultation as trustees are supposed to consult deferred members but there is no guarantee it will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113"> I will not delay as I know other Deputies wish to speak on this matter. Amendment No. 19 raises solvent firms, a matter that received insufficient discussion during the debate on the 2013 Bill. The IASS relates to a solvent firm and the Abbey Theatre is another company with similar problems with deferred members who did not have a say in changes to a pension fund. Some solvent firms will use existing pensions legislation to avoid their commitments. For example, the people behind Waterford Wedgewood, the directors and CEO, were solvent yet the company was wound up and the pension scheme did not benefit workers as it should have.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114"> I could say more on this but I am willing to cede time because this debate will adjourn at 7.30 p.m. and I know at least two Deputies from the area most affected wish to contribute.</p>

          <p eId="para_1116">That is not a problem. I agree with Deputy Shortall that there is irony in the fact that we are discussing this only because the Minister wanted to move changes in the scheme relating to pensions. When we tried to do so on Committee Stage it was deemed out of order. This is an urgent situation and, even though it is late in the day, the Minister must start listening. The Minister met pensioners in the airport groups but there is a perception that the Government is not listening enough - it is more than a perception; it is a reality. The people involved had no choice but to participate in this pension scheme, given their conditions of employment. Their colleagues in the UK and the US who work for the Irish national airline have secure pension rights but those who gave a lifetime of contributions to this pension scheme face cuts to their living standards on the scale outlined by the other Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117"> In these amendments we seek to deal with cases where defined benefit pension schemes have funding problems. We accept that funding problems exist and it is appropriate to use the example of the IASS but this only covers half the question. The question is, if there is a problem with funding, who will pay to solve it. These amendments highlight the fact that the current scenario, where workers and their families pay the price of something that was not their problem to begin with, is unfair and somebody else should bear the cost. The "somebody else" in this situation is the employer. We do not say this lightly but based on a number of serious and important precedents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118"> The first precedent was mentioned earlier. Previous rulings in the High Court, by the likes of Mr. Justice Murphy, deemed the IASS to be a contingent creditor of Aer Lingus.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">This judgment stated that Aer Lingus owed the scheme €500 million in a contingent liability. Of course Aer Lingus is only one of the employers in the scheme. As everyone knows, the amount of moneys being put in to the scheme by the employer is nothing near €500 million. In fact, no money is being put into this scheme at all. Rather, the employers are taking money and putting it into a different pension scheme to benefit some of the current employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120"> There is serious legal precedent to be considered and unless the Government addresses and listens to what Members on this side of the House are saying then, as Deputy Shortall said, it will end up in legal action, which would be regrettable for everyone. No one needs the stress and the expense of that scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121"> There is more than legal precedent to support our argument, including the fact that the company sought to release people. In many instances this was a factor in people leaving the company early and part of the reason some of the strains were put in, if I can put it like that. The employers chose to have new entrants join a different pension scheme rather than this scheme even though participation in the scheme in question was a condition of employment previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122"> Someone must be called to account. The other Deputies are right to highlight the case of the deferred pensioners. I will advert to them presently but existing pensioners will take an immediate hit come 1 January. This group of people will face a six-week per annum cut in their living standards from 1 January. They are already subject to the pension levy of 2.53%. At issue is a substantial amount of money coming out of an average pension of approximately €15,000. Furthermore, active pensioners will be in a far less favourable position as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123"> Why is this pension scheme in trouble? It is not because of the actions of these people and their families. In fact, many took the step, on the encouragement of the company, and left early as part of the package that guaranteed them a particular pension when they retired. They did so because these were reputable State companies and they thought they had a right to believe in what was said to them. The company saved a good deal of money as a result of these people leaving early. There is a misunderstanding in respect of the deferred group. Those in the group are treated as if they had short service and went on to fulfil an alternative career in some other employment or perhaps had access to another pension fund, but that is not the case. Many of these people have contributed decades of work. Some of these amendments seek to deal with the issue of recognition of long service. This is critical because currently those people are decidedly exposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124"> These people are not to blame for the situation. Could we paint a legitimate argument that other people are? I believe we could. I wish to put on record that some of the investment decisions taken by the scheme must be questioned. The Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport should initiate this process. Let us consider the facts. In 2001 the employers advised the trustees to enter a freeze and de-risk strategy and this was implemented. At the time, what, in the interests of etiquette, I can only describe as bizarre investment decisions were made. The trustees invested €800 million in Irish Life. Fully 57% of the scheme's money was tied up in Irish Life. Why? That is against all best actuarial advice, which holds that a pension scheme should diversify. Furthermore, it was against the particular actuarial advice which stated that the property portfolio should be 9%. The trustees brought it down to 0.5%. They were told that the equity portfolio should be approximately 41%. In fact it was 0% and instead they opted for fixed interest securities. They switched hundreds of millions of pensioners' money to Irish Life investments between April 2012 and April 2013, at a time when there were question marks over the future of Irish Life. Two of the three trustee directors have held senior executive positions in Irish Life, a definite conflict of interest given the hundreds of millions of euro in funds owned by the pensioners in those companies. Against actuarial advice they sold an equity portfolio worth €667 million. We have used the examples previously, but a unique, probably unrivalled, property portfolio in the centre of Dublin was sold for €58 million in 2013. It included the Passport Office on Molesworth Street, 15-16 Baggot Street, St. Stephen's Green properties, the European Commission office on Molesworth Street and a block of the Harcourt Centre as well. Property previously valued at €130 million with a considerable rental income was sold for €58 million in 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125"> Jones Lang Lasalle, which was involved in the transaction, was the property adviser to the IASS pension scheme. It was the selling agent for the property. It was the valuation agent for the company that bought it and, finally, the firm was located in one of the buildings. One could not make up the extent of the conflict of interest. Furthermore, Irish Life was an investment adviser to the IASS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126"> While I recognise that there are problems in the scheme, it is not the fault of the people who we are asking to pay the price. I appeal for an investigation into what went on with our funds. I say "our funds" because I am a member of the pension scheme as well, having been an employee of Aer Lingus. It makes me sick to think that people who gave a lifetime of work to what was the State airline and those who worked in the airport authorities and SR Technics are being treated in this way. Unless we attend to this and deal with these amendments then they will pay the price for something that was never their problem to begin with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127"> I re-emphasise the points made by the other Deputies about the lack of involvement in this process. It is sickening that pensioners and deferred members had no access to any of the discussions that went on around the expert panel. Union members had a vote on the matter, but those union members in the companies now are not members of the IAS scheme. They participated in a ballot and that is being used to suggest that workers were consulted. The resulting decision will leave people with six weeks less pay come 1 January. It is simply not good enough. The pensioner group has had no funds put into the scheme to mitigate the impact for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128"> Amendment No. 21 tabled by myself and Deputy Joan Collins suggests that length of service should be given a weight and should be a factor in terms of actuarial factors in the table. This can be done and we had thought that it would be done when we discussed the matter in the context of previous legislation. Unfortunately, that did not materialise in the guidance notes that followed. This aspect must be factored in because we could have a scenario whereby the pensioner group is exposed to further liabilities and cuts in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129"> I know other Deputies want to contribute and that we are coming near the end of this stage of the debate. This is a last-minute appeal to the Minister. There are problems but there are other solutions. There is never only one way to deal with a scenario. The Minister must consider the points that Deputies here have made. We are saying that those who did not create the problem are having to pay the price. This will end up in the courts, resulting in unwarranted stress and hardship for people who had a right to expect something different. They had a legitimate expectation, that has been backed up in other legislation and one that has been given to their colleagues across the water who work for the same companies. Surely we can come up with something better rather than making these people pay.</p>

          <p eId="para_1137">The motion says our health service is underfunded. Michael Keary of Rochestown in Wexford was admitted to Beaumont Hospital on Monday night and his son Patrick wrote to me last night. This is his letter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1138">My father recently started chemo in Beaumont Hospital. He was home for a few days when he got an infection and was requested to return to hospital on the night of 1 December by his own doctor. On arrival, Michael was very weak and unwell. His health continued to deteriorate throughout the night. He was informed that there would neither be a bed or a trolley available for him to spend the night. He was assigned a very uncomfortable chair using his coat as a pillow. Michael had previously been told to stay away from anyone with infections. The chair which he was allocated was among people with a vomiting bug and other contagious infections. Michael asked for a drink of water and nobody could assist as cups were unavailable. Throughout the night, Michael became so uncomfortable his only option was to lay on the floor. Following him laying on the floor, his blood pressure dropped and his heart started to race. They put him on a heart monitor because of concern for his health and only then did they manage to provide him with a trolley.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1139"> Michael is 59 years of age and has been in good health up to this point. He has never depended on the public health service before and has paid health insurance throughout his life. He was very disappointed with the assistance he received when it was most needed. It is not a good country to be unwell.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140"> We know the staff cannot magic up trolleys and beds and can only work with what they have. We also know our health service needs help. In our last budget, we cut some taxes and there is talk of cutting more in the next one. The Government would be better advised to spend its money by investing more in the health service rather than to cut taxes.</p>

        <speech by="#TomFleming" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Deputy Tom Fleming<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1141">I welcome the increase, albeit modest, in the 2015 budget. At least it is on the positive side. I also welcome the fact that for the first time since the HSE was established, the Department of Health and not the former will be responsible for the health budget. A very significant development is that for 2015 the HSE will be able to hire additional staff instead of having to pay the high cost of agency staff. It is an opportunity to provide meaningful permanent employment to our highly skilled medical personnel and enables them to stay at home rather than to seek work abroad. This measure will also relieve the pressure on our understaffed hospital and community services and will facilitate increased hospital activity in the coming year. This is good for patient care and overall budget management.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142"> On the downside, the 2013 plan estimates that there will be 60,000 fewer people on medical cards by the end of 2015. This is based on declining numbers of unemployed persons and a projected increase in income. However, I cannot envisage in my own county, Kerry, any reduction of this type in medical cards due to the fact that we are totally neglected regarding job creation by the IDA. Many small and medium firms are experiencing difficulties in keeping their businesses viable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143"> I plead with the Minister of State here tonight not to act in a heavy-handed manner on the renewal of medical cards. I also ask for a favourable appraisal in the adjudication of new applicants. I ask that the initiative regarding new medical card guidelines will assist people with medical conditions, disabilities and hardship cases to access full medical cards in a customer-friendly manner. I request that services mentioned in the plan for County Kerry are expedited and commence at an early date in the coming year. They will be very welcome.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1144">The most telling thing in the service plan is the comment of Tony O'Brien, Director General of the HSE, in the executive summary to the effect that it will not be possible to put in place any additional or new service developments. That says it all. Despite fanfare about increased funding, all we have done is allow the €500 million overrun and thereafter is it €80 million or €110 million we have got? I would like to know if the €110 million figure includes the €35 million which has been earmarked for several years for mental health services. Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify that. Either way, the funding will just about deal with demographic pressures. As Tony O'Brien says, it will have no significant impact in terms of the delivery of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145"> There are so many questions. All of this is against a background of a budget cut from €16 billion to €13 billion over the last number of years, 10,000 staff gone and thousands of beds closed. It is not possible to see how this budget can have an impact on the crisis that has 40,000 people on waiting lists for over a year and 300,000 people on waiting lists altogether. There are also questions around medical card discretion. In the 2014 budget, €1,875,000 was allowed for but in 2015 there is only €1,722,000, which is a cut of €150,000 on what was allowed for last year. The target last year for elective procedures for children was 100%. While the service plan shows we only managed 50%, the target is back to 100% this year. It does not add up. The target for compliance with the working time directive last year was 100% but the actual outturn was only 67%. The target is nevertheless back up to 100% this year. Again, it does not add up.</p>

          <p eId="para_1146">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate tonight. The statement in the motion to the effect that health services are underfunded is probably the greatest understatement that has been made in the House in a long time. We could spend hours going through where the funding difficulties and problems in the health services are, but my focus in the time allotted to me is on the crisis in care for older people, particularly with regard to the fair deal scheme. The budget for next year provides for an increase of €10 million in the fair deal scheme, which will be nowhere near adequate. Community nursing homes are in crisis because they cannot access enough funding under fair deal to meet their running costs. I think in particular of Áras Ghaoth Dobhair in County Donegal which depends on the fair deal scheme. On foot of the pricing arrangement worked out under the scheme, that community run and led facility cannot even meet its running costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147"> As the number of over-65s will double in the next ten years, there is a massive crisis on our doorstep. We need to see the roll out of a building programme to provide public beds. We must double the number of beds in the system. I wonder if the Department really wants to include the €25 million to come from stopping bed blocking within the HSE. If one moves an elderly person out of an acute hospital into a nursing home under the fair deal scheme, it does not save the HSE any money, it increases the costs of the fair deal bed. Right away, the bed in the acute hospital will be filled with another patient. Being efficient and moving people out of blocked beds will actually increase the cost pressures within the service. I wonder what the motivation is and whether it is to deal with people who are holding up beds in acute hospitals and getting them out into nursing homes and community care. That is really where the issue is.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_420">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1148">It is demoralising to note the number of times the House has discussed the critical and dysfunctional nature of the Health Service Executive. The HSE impacts on citizens from before the cradle to the grave, starting with the crisis in maternity services. It would be much more cost-effective and better for everybody if we shifted the focus to community and midwifery services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149"> I will briefly highlight a scenario that calls to mind the Mad Hatter. A small charity, the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, is propping up the HSE by providing care to vulnerable children with severe disabilities. The foundation does incredibly good work, provides an excellent service, has a track record spanning 17 years, does not have waiting lists and provides services for children on a 24-7 basis. Due to insufficient funding, it is unable to provide services for children before they reach six years, which would correspond with the early years strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150"> There is a crisis in the north Dublin area where three children with severe disabilities are waiting to transition into HSE services. Despite the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation giving ample warning that this scenario was imminent, the three children have been left in limbo and at the mercy and kindness of the foundation, which cannot sustain the additional funding burden into the new year. This is only one example of the dysfunctional nature of the health service and the lack of joined up thinking in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151"> It is not true that the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation receives annual funding of €630,000, as is often claimed. It receives slightly more than €500,000 because some of the funding ostensibly provided to the foundation is accounted for by HSE hours that are filtered through the organisation. If we want to improve the health service, we must place a much greater emphasis on community provision and palliative care.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_421">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1152">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this particularly important subject matter. In the economic climate the Government inherited only a few weeks ago it quickly emerged that the Government faced the prospect of having to throw up its hands and abandon all attempts to provide large areas of service. We inherited a health structure that clearly did not work. It is all very well to criticise the holes and pockets in the health service and its patchiness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153"> Over the years, experts have visited this House to opine on the best structure to run the health services. I never agreed with the view that a single health body was the appropriate model for running the health service. This approach could never work as events such as recent developments in the area of medical cards and many other areas of the health service have demonstrated without a shadow of doubt. One simply cannot run a health service based on an amorphous mass of administration for the entire country. Local knowledge is lacking, circumstances differ and an emphasis on the need to be more personal in the delivery of services is absent. </p>
          <p eId="para_1154"> I congratulate the previous and current Ministers for Health on tackling the health service. While the problems have not yet been resolved to their satisfaction or ours, changes are taking place and a new structure will emerge. I hope the types of things that occurred in the past will not be repeated. We were going around in circles as we tried to deliver a health service to citizens who were crying out for services. Individual cases were not dealt with in a personalised fashion and people felt as if they were numbers on a board. The classic example was the medical card issue that arose in the past year. This problem should never have arisen and I am pleased to note the changes taking place in this regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_1155"> I am also mindful that the health service had to do more work with less money in recent years. This is a difficult task and I do not know how it was intended that it should be done. It is fine to criticise the inability of the Government to deliver serious and demanding services on which expenditure is required when there is no money available. The same people will declare that we must tax the rich. I would like to find out who the rich are and I assume they must be Members of this House. If that is the income that is to be chased after, we need to know where we are going. It is all very easy to produce answers when sitting around having a cosy chat. It is a different kettle of fish, however, when one must deliver the goods and raise money by imposing the taxation required to deliver the quality of service we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156"> Health services have always been demand driven and demand is ever increasing. This must be recognised when we speak of remedies because the solutions will cost a great deal. Like many other Deputies, I was a long time member of one of the health boards in a previous incarnation. We learned the basics on the health boards and one of the basic facts was that one got down to the nitty-gritty and knew exactly what everything cost. Government and Opposition representatives had this information, which meant the matter was in their own hands and they could do what they liked. However, they also knew that they had ultimate responsibility. </p>
          <p eId="para_1157"> I welcome the current budget. It is an improvement and I hope it is successful in delivering an improved quality of service. I also hope we have found the formula to replace the HSE because the current structure has never worked. My colleague, Deputy Billy Kelleher, would no doubt argue that it was never given a chance to work. I was a Deputy when the previous health board structure was abolished because it was not working. The HSE could not work and will never work. I am glad the Government, in difficult circumstances, has taken upon itself the task of restructuring the health service and has provided the money to achieve it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1158">The motion addresses a serious issue. The truth is that if a person is sick, dying or in serious pain, he or she does not have many options and will want to avail of a health system that can provide help. I welcome the honest attitude taken by the Minister because a lack of honesty adds insult to injury. Having read the motion and noted the signatories to it, I can only describe it as a scam. The scam here is having people lured in by a show of empathy, the wringing of hands, crying and pointing out all the hardship in the health service - for instance, waiting lists - before a general statement is made about how the service should be. As Deputy Durkan stated, one can cherry-pick while never providing answers to questions on where the money will be found. Somebody must make these difficult decisions and sometimes one would need the wisdom of Solomon to make them.</p>

          <p eId="para_1162">Sinn Féin provided for even less funding than is provided in the budget. Let us not make a joke at the expense of the people of Ireland. Savage cuts have been made in health in recent years. The embargo on recruitment meant hard-pressed staff had to make do without new recruits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">People are no longer able to pay for private health insurance because of the downturn in the economy. More pressure has been put on a system which is not in a position to take any more. More people are turning up at accident and emergency departments because GPs are not in a position to service them. There is more pressure in regard to medical cards and never before have so many received them. People are being put in a position where they cannot afford to pay for health care and it all stems from what happened when the previous Government was in power.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164"> Not long after I was elected to the Dáil, I had the experience of seeing a large march in my town because the local district hospital in Ballina was to be shut down. A crowd of Fianna Fáil hacks organised the march, something I can say without reservation. The hospital was to be closed because there was a question mark over bed numbers as a result of the recruitment embargo. The truth of the matter was that funding had been found, but it was for agency staff and the unions, rather than the staff in the hospital, objected. Was any of this said to those who were afraid they would lose what was a valued hospital and which provided respite and step-down beds? No, it was not. I am glad to say that not only was the 50 bed unit retained, but there has also been an extension to and refurbishment of the hospital. There are hospice suites, while there has been a €1 million capital investment, in conjunction with Mayo-Roscommon hospice, and the unit was officially opened by the Taoiseach. I did not hear any Fianna Fáil hack welcome this or say they got it wrong. Apparently, that is not how politics works.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165"> As I said, these issues are too serious to mess around with them. If we are serious about any problem facing any person in distress, we should treat it as if a house was on fire. One does not throw oil on a fire; rather, one quenches it, tries to save people and sort out the problem, but the Opposition does not know how to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166"> Since the Government came into power, there has been additional provision for psychiatric services. Ballina will shortly have a psychiatry in older age team for older people with mental health problems. There is a second child and adolescent mental health service team in Ballina, in my county. There are many other good news stories, where things have been salvaged from nothing. There have been no budgets. We have had to decide on priorities and when money is put into one area, it has to be taken from another, but that is not to say there is no need for reform in some areas. However, it is very hard to do everything when budgets are constrained.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1167">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about this issue. I acknowledge the work of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, during the short time he has been in his position. There are obvious constraints, but the work he is trying to do is important. It is important to say it is the first time since 2008 that there has been a modest increase in funding. During a time when money was supposed to grow on trees, that is, from 2003 to 2006, and problems accelerated within the health service, more money was thrown at it, but things did not get better. There were still bed blockages and fundamental problems within the system, but there is now an opportunity to examine the ethos of accountability and responsibility within the health service. Many good people are doing sterling work and have been working within a number of constraints in the past few years. Fundamentally, there has to be a point where there is accountability. </p>
          <p eId="para_1168"> I refer to a sensitive case in Carndonagh, where Mrs. Maura Porter lay dying on a street because there was a problem in getting an ambulance to the scene. The family provided a very stark description of the last few minutes of their mother's life. Rather than spending them with her, holding her hand, they spent them trying to get the emergency services to the scene. That is wrong. Everybody knows that should not happen in a modern society - ambulances were available, but they were not at the scene when they should have been. It was not the case that somebody decided not to go; rather, there were problems with the system. Beds were available and there were ambulances in the county. There is a relationship with Altnagelvin hospital, but there seemed to be a complete and bizarre simple communication malfunction. </p>
          <p eId="para_1169"> A large number of young entrepreneurs are working on computer programmes in both a very sophisticated and simplistic way to try to develop communications and responsible programmes to deliver services to customers in the private sector. One such person in Buncrana has developed a new programme, Click Clinic, which tries to provide communications, using computer technology, for persons who are relying on simple physiotherapy procedures. We need to reach out to a new generation of young people who provide these models to ensure the tragedies and travesties that happened in the past do not happen again. Gartan Technologies which is based in Letterkenny is doing wonderful work throughout the United Kingdom and recently won an Australian contract. It provides communication alert systems for fire brigade and fire services in the greater London area to ensure people are in the position they need to be in at a given time. I cannot begin to get a grip on the magnitude of the Minister's portfolio, but we have to reach out to a new generation who are working on new ways of doing things to counter the negative consequences of a number of tragedies. We now have an opportunity to do this and the Minister is the person to do it.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekKeating" eId="spk_428">
          <from>Deputy Derek Keating<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1170">I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to the debate in the presence of the Minister. The HSE will benefit from an additional €305 million in Exchequer funding over the amount allocated last year, which is a very good beginning. It has identified a minimum savings target of €130 million in procurement, drugs and agency costs. I am anxious that these savings, in particular in the provision of drugs, will filter down to the pharmacy counter in order that those who benefit from the drug payments scheme and have private prescriptions see realistic savings in their monthly prescription costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171"> In its manifesto prior to the 2011 general election Fine Gael set out a number of key areas of reform within the health care setting. The provision of increased access to GP care without payment for those over 70 and under six years of age is a key measurable element on the pathway towards universal health care. In addition, the manifesto provided for the extension of and additional investment in mental health and suicide prevention teams. </p>
          <p eId="para_1172"> Those who know me well will know that I spent six years as a very proud director of Pieta House. It continues to do wonderful work, which I commend. I also commend the commitment and expertise of those who seek to increase awareness and provide an insight into the supports necessary to save lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">We in this House were left without a valuable friend, former Minister of State, Shane McEntee, at his death in the prime of his life. He is never forgotten. Suicide is the scourge of Ireland and every life saved has far-reaching benefits for individuals, families and communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174"> The extension of the BreastCheck programme to women up to the age of 69 will allow for earlier diagnosis and screening among the target group and is a critical expansion recently committed to by the Government. CervicalCheck is a new indicator which targets the provision of 271,000 tests in 2015 and BowelScreen targets over 200,000 people in the age range of 60 to 69. Diabetic retinal screening will provide 78,300 tests for the target group of diabetics, those over the age of 12.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175"> The manifesto also provided for increased access to primary care settings. Many of the tests mentioned will be provided in such centres through the increased allocation of €14 million to increase the range of services that can be provided in order to keep people out of hospitals and provide treatment in their communities. I have already seen the benefit to my constituency in Palmerstown and I am glad to note the advances made towards progressing a primary care centre in Lucan. I have had discussions with the HSE and interested parties in an effort to bring a primary care centre to Lucan and I am delighted this process is at an advanced stage, as Lucan is the fastest growing satellite town in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176"> We must not forget the changing age of our population or the need to provide for our citizens as they age. The provision in the plan for older persons, as part of one of the five integrated care programmes, is welcome. This will improve integration of services, access and outcomes for patients generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177"> I have a particular interest in the provision of palliative care services and to this end, I have also been engaged with Peamount hospital in my constituency. I acknowledge the willingness and openness of the CEO, the chairperson and director of nursing at Peamount with whom I have engaged over the past number of years to examine what measures they can provide through existing facilities to provide end of life care. Peamount is an independent hospital and it has already developed expertise in end of life care, particularly in regard to people with COPD. Palliative care is something we can bring to that. Our Lady's Hospice in Harold's Cross provides outreach services, but there is a shortage of palliative care beds in the Lucan catchment area. West Dublin is identified particularly in the HSE plan as needing measures to address this deficiency in 2015. I welcome the positive engagement with the relevant stakeholders who can meet this deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178"> I commend the counter motion and urge the HSE to continue its mission to provide targeted appropriate actions that are measurable, accountable and sustainable for the people.</p>

        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_429">
          <from>Deputy Liam Twomey<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1179">I listened to Deputy Kelleher's contribution last night and thought he almost acknowledged that previous administrations, in which his party was to the fore, made many mistakes in regard to how our health services were arranged. Looking back, we can see that when the economy went into a severe downturn, our health services were poorly positioned to deal with it. No meaningful reform had been carried out. Money was being poured into health services, but there was no great sense of where the money was going.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180"> As far back as 2001, the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, felt putting money into the health sector was like putting money into a black hole. In 2004 when Deputy Martin was Minister for Health - I was a Member of the Dáil at the time - his Secretary General appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Health in regard to the Minister's failure to deal with the illegal nursing home charges. The Secretary General stated at the time that the important constantly conspires to push out the urgent in health. I believe this is one of the reasons former Ministers, Micheál Martin and Mary Harney, lost their way in regard to what they were doing with health. They were not quite able to separate what was important from what was urgent in regard to health services. To some degree there was a sense they just gave up on it, despite the fact €1 billion extra was being put into the health service at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181"> The collapse in the economy was a disaster for the health service, because there was no great sense of a policy being followed or no sense that people had the courage to make the right decisions. There has been a turning point in this regard since we came into power. The first turn around came in the ethos of the health services and now we have reached a new turning point where we are in a position to put additional funding into health. It is important we start reinvesting in the health services and that we begin to deal with the core issues where additional funding is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182"> It is even more important that we have clear communication in the health area, not just with patients but with all individuals working in the area. In my 20 years in health and as a Member of the Oireachtas, I have seen much frustration and exasperation, not alone among patients but among everybody who works in the health services. Often this has nothing to do with failures in the health services, but with perceived failures and the failure to communicate policy or what is going on. We are getting better in this regard, slowly but surely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183"> The talks on GP contracts for dealing with children under six are progressing. The majority of GPs have also acknowledged the need for new contracts for medical card patients. We must move away from the acute illness type system to a more chronic care type system in primary care. There is much to be done in the area of primary care, but significant change has taken place already. For example, my practice nurse takes bloods, does vaccinations and smear tests etc, jobs that were done by GPs just seven or eight years ago. The system is changing. IT is changing also. One of the biggest problems in regard to IT is that the hospital sector is not moving at the same rate as the primary care sector, which would help maximise IT efficiencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184"> We are going to see more changes for the greater benefit of patients. I offer my full support to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, because he has got the concept, and separates what is important and deals with what is urgent in a clear and precise manner. Although there are problems with our current medical card system, these are not insurmountable. All of the issues that have arisen can be dealt with. It is an issue of communicating what we are doing to the people most affected - the patients - and of providing a clear system that works well for those who provide the service to patients - the GPs. I note from my communication with GPs across the country that their main concern is about how the Government communicates with them rather than how the system operates. We need to progress further in this regard in the coming weeks.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1185">I am glad to have the opportunity to raise some issues regarding the recently published HSE service plan. I thank Fianna Fáil for putting forward this motion, despite the fact the first sentence states the health services are under funded. It seems Fianna Fáil has no sense of shame or humility regarding the reason for the series of cuts over the past seven or eight years in funding for health services. This HSE service plan is particularly welcome because it sees the first increase in funding in that time and a substantial increase in funding is projected for the HSE in the year ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186"> I welcome the provision in the capital budget for the finishing of the new emergency department and medical assessment and endoscopy units in St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny. It has always been a fantastic hospital, but many of its facilities are outdated.</p>

          <p eId="para_1188">Fair play to Commissioner Hogan, indeed, and to others - well pointed out, Deputy Kelleher. I myself had some slight hand in it being built, if I could be so presumptuous as to suggest it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189"> For the past number of years and to this day, the emergency department in St. Luke's in Kilkenny was in what was originally designed as the washing-up area of the original hospital that was built in the 1950s. Thankfully, the new emergency department is well on its way to completion and I am glad the service plan includes that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190"> I too welcome the fact the BreastCheck service is to be extended to women up to the age of 69 following a national campaign in that regard. I am glad the Minister has been able to accede to that request.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191"> Another important measure in this plan relates to the funding the HSE has included for drugs for those who suffer from hepatitis C, a particularly debilitating illness for which there is now a cure. Some €30 million is being set aside under this service plan to provide people who heretofore would have been in a very difficult situation with some hope that their medical condition can be improved dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192"> I also want to welcome the fact €25 million has been included in the service plan for the additional provision of up to 300 places under the fair deal scheme and 115 short-stay beds. It has been apparent in recent months in particular that a bottleneck has emerged in this area and many people are waiting too long for assessment and admission to the fair deal scheme. I welcome the fact additional funding has been provided for that in the service plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193"> I join with Deputy Twomey in regard to the Minister's announcements on medical cards. There is no doubt that, in the past 12 months, this has probably been the most contentious issue in the health area. The committee was charged by the previous Minister to come up with recommendations and it came back and suggested it would find it impossible to draw up a list of illnesses which would automatically qualify people for medical cards, and that the means-tested system would have to be included and adapted. The Minister has chosen to act quickly on that, which I welcome. In fact, the Minister has been a breath of fresh air in many respects in his few months in the Department of Health. It is a difficult Department but, in particular with regard to medical cards, which has been a protracted and difficult political issue but which is obviously and more importantly a difficult issue for families and individuals across the country, he has been willing to look at a practical solution for people in difficulties.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanBarrett" eId="spk_433">

          <p eId="para_1194">I call Deputy Kitt, who I understand is sharing time with Deputies Keaveney, Troy and McConalogue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_434">
          <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T20:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1195">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the motion, which I compliment Deputy Kelleher on tabling. Down through the years in my part of the west, we have been hearing about consultants and specialists being appointed and that they would be shared between hospitals. In my own area, this is usually between the hospitals at Ballinasloe, Galway and Roscommon. I am disappointed that the sharing of these posts does not seem to be of great benefit to the smaller hospitals, by which I mean the grade 3 and grade 2 hospitals, which seem to be forgotten about. The proposal was that, as well as sharing the work between the hospitals, many more procedures would be carried out in the smaller hospitals. I would like to see that happen and I am disappointed it has not happened to a fuller extent. This leads to uncertainty in the health service and leads to many meetings being called and demonstrations taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196"> One of the reasons for this is obviously that budgets in these hospitals have reduced, in particular in 2013 and 2014, and the indications for next year are not yet available. While there is a great effort by the HSE and the hospitals to keep down costs, I believe we are still not treating these hospitals fairly. Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe is a grade 3 hospital but a significant hospital nonetheless which serves the east midlands and the mid-west, and Mayo Hospital is in a similar position. These hospitals need extra staff and new equipment but there has been no response in recent times. Five years ago I attended the opening of a special care baby unit and an emergency department at Portiuncula Hospital but I do not believe I have seen the opening of any new services since then. This is particularly disappointing given there are applications to improve that grade 3 hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197"> There is an excellent hospital in Galway city, University College Hospital. While it has a fine budget, I wonder about its capacity to develop services when I see what is happening with the psychiatric services there. There was a 22-bed acute psychiatric unit at St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe but the beds were transferred to Galway, where there was already overcrowding. Ballinasloe was to get crisis beds but that has not happened. There is funding under the mental health budget but recruitment is an issue, although it should be happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198"> There are also issues with the fair deal scheme, which I dealt with in a recent debate in the House. I was approached by the Roscommon home care co-operative society, a not-for-profit organisation that is involved in caring in three counties, Galway, Roscommon and Mayo. It was very concerned when it received correspondence from the HSE stating that, in providing services to private clients, it may be in breach of EU state aid regulations due to the potential for cross-subsidisation. I certainly do not understand what that is about or how cross-subsidisation could arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199"> Deputy Keaveney and I both know the ambulance base in Tuam has been idle for some time. I welcome the fact the HSE service plan includes Tuam with Mulranny and Loughglynn but, again, there is a staffing issue. I hope staff will be recruited quickly because we need a 24-7 ambulance base in Tuam. HIQA has recognised this as a blackspot in the west region. We saw in media reports today that the HSE has admitted that urgently needed improvements in the ambulance services will now have to be delayed because of a lack of resources. That is a worrying situation because it refers to rural areas more than to those operating in the larger towns and cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200"> The situation at Tuam would be dealt with by having 11 staff, as that number would be needed for a 24-7 hour service, but there is no staffing at present - that is the bottom line. The fact HIQA criticised the lack of co-operation between the national ambulance service and the Dublin fire brigade shows there are problems and challenges. In fact, it was noted that 14,000 calls a year to the brigade were left in a queue while it tried to source an ambulance from the national service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201"> I hope we can have work on that announcement about the ambulance service and that the Minister will take on board what Deputy Kelleher has said in proposing the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1202">I am glad the Ceann Comhairle is in the Chair tonight because I want to publicly acknowledge his kind written words to my family with respect to the passing of my brother, Kieran. The Ceann Comhairle has had a difficult day, or at least attempts in that regard were made by some, but I want to acknowledge his commitment to being the father of this House and the good work he does behind the scenes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203"> The Minister for Health recently engaged in a PR stunt by going out with an ambulance crew on a shift. In fairness, it generated some positive focus on the ambulance crew and the Minister probably got some kudos out of it for himself. However, the people who are dependent on the ambulance service require him to be less focused on PR stunts, to get behind the desk of his new Ministry and to start dealing with the problems that are coming up every day within the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204"> One of those problems is the state of the national ambulance service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">HIQA recently published a report which explicitly says: "[I]t is of significant concern to the Authority that the well known ambulance 'black spot' areas of Tuam Co Galway, Mulranny Co Mayo and Loughglynn Co Roscommon remain without a dedicated ambulance resource." The report also says that at the time of review there were no staff at Mulranny and Tuam and there was occasional movement of an ambulance between Tuam and Roscommon, serving both locations. It is a damning review that states that if we do not properly resource these areas and address any deficits, we are astray with regard to the national ambulance strategy. It should be a concern to everybody where I live, because the HSE has failed to act with regard to emergency response times. </p>
          <p eId="para_1206"> I am asking the Minister to pay particular attention to the black spot in Tuam. I appreciate that I am here to represent my constituency, but I ask the Minister to remember that the absence of investment in the 11 EMTs identified by Deputy Kitt is essentially playing Russian roulette with my community, because the closest response time is 62 minutes from Galway city. This is completely out of sync with regard to adequate or acceptable response times. The Minister was canvassing in the by-election in Roscommon, as was I. The people there are as angry as the people of Tuam with regard to commitments for the delivery of health services. I ask the Minister to pay attention to the commitment to open that ambulance base in Tuam and to be more honourable than the Taoiseach was when he stood in front of the people of Roscommon with regard to the commitments he made. I ask the Minister to pull back from the preliminary rounds of Fine Gael's leadership battle and to focus strictly on his job, because I think he could do a good job in health if he was less obsessed with taking out the Taoiseach and focused more on the role of Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207"> I will now move on to mental health. As the Minister is aware, an additional commitment of €35 million is ring-fenced this year as part of the programme for Government to provide for the roll-out of specialist staff for community-led psychiatric teams. The Government has consistently failed to honour that commitment since 2011. In fact, we should have expected €50 million in ring-fenced and focused investment in light of the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, capitulated and let the former Minister for Health pickpocket her in the 2014 service plan. This has consistently undermined the roll-out of A Vision of Change. The Minister of State has abjectly failed. The only consistency she has managed to maintain since 2011 is her failure to protect her budget. The fact that she has failed to protect her budget means that she has failed to deliver on the service plan. This year, only a small quantum of the €20 million in additional funding provided for mental health staffing is being invested. This is a consequence of the deliberate situation designed last year whereby staff provided for in the service plan in 2014 were time-delayed. The service plan provided for 200 staff last year but not one of them is currently <i>in situ</i> and we are now in December. This is the tactic that people out there are seeing through. I accept that there is a cynical approach with regard to the hiring of staff. I now know that it has been designed to ensure that it came at the end of the year, but mental health and mental illness do not wait for budgets, time delays and deliberate manipulation of the budget to ensure its effect is maximised. I ask the Minister of State to speak to stakeholders and look at the impact of these decisions, because I have a sense that she is surrounding herself with and hand-picking managers who offer advice she wants to hear. The Minister of State is opposed to any sort of critical analysis with regard to the roll-out of A Vision for Change. She does not listen to the front-line staff. I ask the Minister to listen to the words of Dr. Shari McDaid, director of mental health reform. She has said that the HSE's ability to provide people in mental and emotional distress with the support they need depends on the presence of skilled staff, and that services will not run 24-7 because crisis intervention support is simply not there. She went on to say that while more than 700 staff have been recruited into mental health services since 2011, there are still only 90 additional posts in light of the fact that natural wastage, redundancy and retirement have been the opportunities the Minister of State has used with regard to further recruitment. She has spoken about how the HSE service plan commits to building capacity for mental health services to respond 24 hours a day to people in a crisis. This is pushing it out there until the latter part of 2015, which is a concern for the stakeholders. In particular, I ask the Minister of State to sit down and talk to the service users and front-line staff in respect of the roll-out of the subsequent aspects of A Vision for Change. </p>
          <p eId="para_1208"> The Disability Federation of Ireland, DPI, welcomed the additional €20 million provided for in the service plan. However, as we sit here today, the Minister is taking money from the Brothers of Charity and Ability West. John Dolan, CEO of DPI, stated that it is a demand-led service and that it continues to draw out money in light of the fact that one person a week sustains a spinal cord injury. He also said that we are seeing increasing numbers entering the service and that with only €20 million the service is running to stand still. He stated: "The HSE Service Plan talks about disability services moving towards new models of service delivery that enable people with disabilities to participate in a meaningful way in their own communities." Talking in general about the service plan, Mr Dolan stated: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1209">The health system is deteriorating at a worrying rate. Ireland’s population is increasing, people are living longer, waiting lists are drastically increasing and there are worrying levels of unmet need. Those providing health services simply don't have the resources required to deliver to an acceptable standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">I am entirely in agreement with Mr Dolan. I think we should all work together to focus on his concerns. Health desperately needs adequate funding. It is demand-led. I know the Minister is honest and can identify the issues, but he needs to stay with them. We need to work together to find solutions for these issues because we have a mutual interest in the health of this country. We cannot approach the health service in the same way we approached the last budget, whereby we set out essentially to buy votes with tax cuts. We need to learn lessons of the decisions of the past, as I was elected to do. We need to be honest about budgeting and to have a proper framework on how we budget for the health service. The Minister will have support from this side of the House if he is prepared to be transparent, honest and realistic with regard to those budgets. People within the health service are alarmed at the deteriorating conditions in which they are working. It is becoming patently clear to the public that the public health service is in crisis. It is no wonder we hear that everything is dandy in the mental health service, as the Minister of State said last week. There were no problems. She went out and allegedly listened to front-line staff. Like Catherine the Great, she allows herself to be presented with Potemkin villages. I ask the Minister to speak to the Minister of State so that she gets out of that bubble of senior managers, advisers and experts around her and listens to the experiences of service users and front-line staff and, for once, gets an honest opinion about what is happening rather than listening to people who tell her what she wants to hear.</p>

          <from>Deputy Robert Troy<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1211">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate this evening. It is an extremely important and timely debate, given that the Minister published the HSE service plan in the past number of days. The Department of Health is an extremely important Department. It is a Department that touches the lives of practically everybody in the country. Usually, it touches people's lives at a time when they are particularly vulnerable. Unfortunately, over the past number of years, many decisions that were taken - some by the Minister's predecessor, but many collectively by the Cabinet - have had a detrimental effect on the sick and the vulnerable. In many instances, this has compounded the problems and illnesses that people have experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">It has contributed unnecessarily to anxiety and fear among many people. We do not have to look very far back to be reminded of the anxiety and fear inflicted on the people of County Longford due to the deficit in St. Christopher's hospital. In a previous debate I thanked the Minister for his intervention in this matter but I have since been informed that the Taoiseach had to instruct him to make the necessary funding available. This information came from Deputy Bannon. Whoever was involved, it should not require 3,000 people protesting in the spilling rain, including families, sick people and people with intellectual disabilities, to force the Government into a U-turn. Despite the increase in the HSE budget, the deficit that emerged in 2012 means there will not be sufficient funding even to stand still in 2015, let alone meet the increasing demands placed on our hospital systems. I fear that we will have more of what we experienced in the last several years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213"> The HSE service plan indicates that free GP care for children under the age of six years will be delivered next year. Funding of €37 million had previously been promised to implement the free GP scheme in 2014, for which there would be no fees at point of use. Twelve months later, the funding has been reduced by €12 million and we are still being promised that it will be delivered. What confidence can the parents who are waiting for free GP care for their children have that it will be introduced in 2015? Free GP care means no charges but I note that the Minister in some of his media outings mentioned a nominal fee. Perhaps he can confirm whether there will be a nominal fee or if the service will be free. I worry about this Government's record on nominal fees. It came to office promising to abolish the nominal fee for prescription charges but it was instead increased fivefold.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214"> I acknowledge that an additional €20 million is being invested in disability services but this has to be viewed in the context of the reduction of €159 million since 2008. As Mr. John Dolan, the CEO of the Disability Federation of Ireland, said, this does not even start to plug the gap. I recently spoke to the parent of a young man who lives with three other men in a community house in my constituency. In the past 12 months, the number of staff working in that house decreased from four to three, which has resulted in a savage deterioration in the quality of life for the men who live in the house. They are no longer able to go bowling and are effectively prisoners in their home because there are insufficient staff to ensure they can enjoy extra-curricular activities. It does not say much for us as a society if that is how we are treating young men with intellectual disabilities. These men, who have Down's syndrome or other intellectual disabilities, are being forced into reviews of their medical cards on a yearly and, in some instances, a half-yearly basis. Talk about an administrative burden given that the medical conditions of these young gentlemen will, unfortunately, never get better.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215"> The Minister is living up to his commitment on mental health by investing €35 million in the sector this year. However, only €20 million was provided last year. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, promised that the shortfall would be made up in this year's allocation. That has not happened. A colleague recently outlined the case of young person known to Túsla who was in residential care due to her psychiatric condition. Even though this person was under the age of 18 years and was experiencing suicidal ideation, she only received one visit from the child and adolescent mental health service in a 13 month period. That is not good enough. Dr. Shari McDaid has pointed out that the HSE has fewer than three quarters of the staff it needs to deliver the Government's mental health policy. How do we propose to deal with the critical issue of mental health and the number of young men, in particular, who are taking their own lives if the experts say we have fewer than three quarters of the staff required? This is something that the Minister needs to address urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216"> In regard to the fair deal scheme, I commend staff in Longford-Westmeath on their efficiency and punctuality in dealing with application forms. However, a concerted effort is needed to provide funding for people who are no longer able to live in their own homes. The population of those over 80 years of age is increasing by 4% annually but this increase is not being matched by the necessary funding. It is a sad reflection on this society if we cannot acknowledge the contribution these people have made to society by providing adequate nursing home care to them when they are in their old age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217"> At the HSE forum of 21 October, a councillor raised the issue of the downgrading of our local office of the Registrar for Births, Marriages and Deaths. When I raised a similar issue by way of parliamentary question, I was told the office would be open three days per week, namely, Mondays from 9.15 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., Wednesdays from 9.15 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., and Fridays from 9.15 a.m. to 12.30 p.m., and that the introduction of lunchtime opening and later opening hours was well received by the public. Last week notice was posted on the door of the office that it would open one day per week for five hours. When the HSE was asked to comment it stated the late opening hours were well received by the public. Why is a birth registration office located on the campus of one of the busiest maternity hospitals outside of Dublin only open for five hours per week? I ask the Minister to investigate the problem. I am informed that two staff members in the office are on long-term leave because of bullying. This should be investigated urgently to ensure we provide a proper service for the people of Mullingar.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1218">I thank Deputy Kelleher for tabling this motion on the inadequacy of the HSE service plan for 2015, which was published in the past week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219"> I will comment, first, on the HIQA review of the ambulance service and emphasise the importance of investing to increase the number of ambulances in different parts of the country. The report indicates difficulties in co-ordination between hospitals and the ambulance service which must be addressed. There is a definite need for investment in the service, particularly outside Dublin where there are large areas to be covered. In the absence of ambulances and staff working in these areas, waiting and response times are impacted on. In that regard, I refer to the death last year of Maura Porter on New Year's Eve and the experience of her family who are but one of many other families who have been impacted on by the lack of co-ordination, on the one hand, and the need for additional investment, on the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220"> With regard to the service plan, I will focus on its impact on County Donegal and Letterkenny General Hospital, in particular. The experience in Letterkenny is replicated across the country. There are over 2,400 people on the waiting list who are waiting for more than one year for an outpatient appointment with a consultant at Letterkenny General Hospital. That number has increased by 1,500 in the past six months. There are also 3,000 people on the surgery waiting list. These are the official hospital figures which I received in response to parliamentary questions to the Minister. It is unacceptable and not the type of service which people in County Donegal or elsewhere in the country should expect from the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221"> I focus, in particular, on people who have been affected by the outpatient waiting list initiative which the HSE and the Department of Health brought forward this time last year. In the case of Letterkenny, 2,700 patients were outsourced from Letterkenny General Hospital to private hospitals to be seen by a consultant. These are separate from the numbers I quoted for hospital waiting lists. Of this number, approximately half were either treated or discharged back to their general practitioner. However, 1,300 have been left in limbo since last year, with no follow-up treatment. Over one year after being outsourced by the HSE to a private consultant or private hospital, 1,300 people across the county have not had either follow-up tests with these consultants or the surgery it has been indicated or reported to the hospital that they require. There is no funding set aside in the HSE service plan to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222"> I hope the Minister will deal specifically with the patients who were covered by the waiting list initiative last year and what will happen to them. It has been indicated to me that there is a likelihood these patients will have to return to the hospital waiting list and will not receive the follow-up treatment they require from the consultant to whom they were initially referred. That means the outsourcing and visits to these consultants will have been a waste of money in many cases because the patients will have to be seen by the internal hospital consultants again before appropriate follow-up treatment can be arranged. It is totally unacceptable that the Government is prioritising funding towards what it regards as election winning measures through decreases in the higher rate of tax, while not addressing this very serious issue or allocating funding to ensure patients can be treated. I ask the Minister to address this issue or that he revert to me with specific proposals for how the needs of these patients will be addressed. In just one county over 1,300 patients are in limbo for over one year with no indication of how they will have the tests or operations they require. It is unacceptable and the issue must be addressed immediately. They cannot be left to continue without any follow-up treatment, which is the current position.</p>

          <p eId="para_1223">I will certainly follow up on the matter raised by Deputy Charlie McConalogue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224"> One of the most frustrating things about reports, into which those involved put a great deal of hard work, is that people do not understand them fully. The HIQA report on the ambulance service is silent on whether there should be additional ambulances. That issue will be addressed in the HSE's capacity report. HIQA talks about the age of the fleet, but it does not call for additional ambulances. However, it points out that we use ambulances very inefficiently. We do not conduct a dynamic dispatch system. There are too many ambulances sitting in fire stations, ambulance centres and hospitals when they should be available for dynamic dispatch. HIQA criticises the communications and speed of dispatch. It also points out that if we were to apply what is done in other countries, 40% of those covered by ambulance calls would not require to go to an emergency department at all. It is a good report and people should read it, rather than just default to the obvious stuff about providing more resources, the fleet and journey times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225"> Deputy Robert Troy mentioned the Government's decision, intervention and U-turn in the case of St. Christopher's. To be clear, there was no decision, intervention or U-turn in the case of St. Christopher's. Deputy James Bannon expressed his concerns to me many times, as did the Taoiseach. It was a matter of great interest and concern to the Deputy, but it was one for the HSE. They were not decisions made at ministerial or government level, which I hope is clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226"> I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the funding of the health service and, in particular, the HSE's national service plan for 2015. I will deal with a number of specific matters that have been raised by Deputies during the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227"> Several Deputies raised the issue of discretionary medical cards. The HSE is taking the necessary steps to improve the operation of the medical card scheme and especially the arrangements for the issuing of medical cards on a discretionary basis, generally on medical grounds, even though the means test has not been satisfied. I do not claim that the new system will be perfect, but I will continue to oversee implementation of these steps and, if further improvements are deemed necessary, I will consider them. It will, however, be six to eight months before the ten actions announced last week are implemented and I ask for patience until then and also that issues or shortcomings be flagged to my office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228"> Waiting times under the fair deal scheme are now approximately 14 weeks. This is not satisfactory and I am anxious to address the issue. It is recognised that the matter of delayed discharges is not one that can wait until the new year. Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, outlined a number of measures that were already under way to start to deal with this issue of concern. It requires an integrated response across primary, community and residential services and my Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure the available resources are deployed in the most effective way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229"> A number of Deputies mentioned health reform in general. Next year will see the establishment and development of hospital groups,<b>
						</b>community health care organisations<b>
						</b>and the development of the national clinical programmes<b>
						</b>which will be delivered through these new structures. These core health reforms are essential if we are to deliver better quality care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230"> I share the concerns of Deputies about waiting times; too many are waiting too long for surgical procedures and outpatient appointments. We know from past experience that throwing money at the problem of waiting lists does not make it go away. This was particularly demonstrated during the Celtic tiger economy years, when waiting lists remained a significant and ongoing cause of concern, despite the increasing level of funding provided. Providing more resources without reform simply does not work. If we learned anything from the years of boom and bust, the years of splurge, followed by years of austerity, we should have learned that. That is the reason the Government wishes to address the underlying structural issues which are contributing to increasing demands on the hospital sector and the resultant rise in waiting times. The establishment and development of hospital groups and community health care organisations<b>
						</b>and the development of patient-centred integrated models of care<b>
						</b>are central to this structural shift and will, over time, ensure quality patient care is delivered in the setting most appropriate to the needs of the patient which, in most cases, will be a primary care setting or a setting close to home. The service plan provides for an additional €14 million to further develop primary care services, including an extension of the pilot GP ultrasound access project<b>
						</b>and the provision of additional minor surgery services<b>
						</b>in agreed primary care sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231"> The HSE is also putting in place a number of measures next year to tackle waiting lists more efficiently, including prioritising day-of-surgery admissions, pre-admission clinics to ensure patients are fit for surgery and flexible use of theatre capacity within and among specialties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">I am also pleased to inform the House that I have, this week, approved an initiative to provide additional GI scopes for endoscopies and colonoscopies up to the end of 2014. This decision was taken to address very long waiting lists for these procedures in certain hospitals which, between them, are responsible for over 80% of the waiting list.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233"> During last night's debate, Deputy Kelleher referred to a level of pretence that exists around the health budget for 2015. The opposite is the case. The HSE management, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I have been honest and up front about what can be delivered in 2015 with the increased resources available. We have not over promised, but have been realistic, and have explained that the modest increase in resources being provided in 2015 is but the first step of a two year process to stabilise the health service budget. I have already secured an increased ceiling of €174 million for health expenditure in 2016.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_439">
          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2014-12-03T20:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1234">I thank my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, for tabling the motion on the underfunding of the national service plan for 2015. When he launched the plan on Thursday, 27 November, the HSE Director General, Tony O'Brien, said the additional funding "will not...be sufficient to fully address the increasing demands being placed on our hospital system, in particular the growing waiting lists for elective admissions.” This is an indictment of the national service plan 2015. Mr. O'Brien said the plan does not meet the needs for 2015. Enough said. It is no wonder we will be back with a Supplementary Estimate in the coming days for 2014, as we will be for 2015. While the Minister might say otherwise, evidence from the HSE Director General will contradict him, and I accept what Mr. O'Brien says because he is a straight talker.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235"> On budget day in October, when the Estimates were published here, we pointed out the black hole of €460 million in the Estimate for the Department of Health, comprising the magical, increased revenue of €330 million and drug procurement savings of €130 million. The HSE has proved itself incapable of delivering the savings required in the drugs procurement budget and it should be removed from the HSE and given to the Government's Office of Government Procurement. One national office is getting increasing strength and ability in national procurement. It is so good that it is causing flack at a local level because small, local suppliers can lose out. It is getting the best price for the taxpayer and that is what is needed in this situation. The expertise needed is available in the Office of Government Procurement, not in the HSE. The job of the people in the HSE is to deliver health services, and they should not be doing a job that can be better done by another State agency, such as the Office of Government Procurement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236"> At last week's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, I was shocked to hear the HSE intended to spend a lot of money next year on a patient identifier number system. It is a disgrace and I ask the Minister to reconsider it. Given that everybody in Ireland has a PPS number, why does the HSE want to invent another system? It should attach the PPS number to existing files. The Revenue Commissioners have everybody's house listed in the local property tax system. Practically 40% of the population have medical cards with a number from the HSE. Yet the HSE proposes to spend millions of euro on a new IT system for a new numbering system for everybody in the country. Will the Minister tell the people in his Department and the HSE, who should be working to deliver health services, to leave the job of identifying people by number to those who do it best, namely, the Department of Social Protection, which already supplies the PPS numbers? People will have a PPS number, a patient identification number and a medical number. It is nonsense. Each person should have one number. The Minister should ask his staff to hand over that operation. I was shocked to hear that the HSE does not have a patient identifier number. The Department should not need to spend money on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237"> There are 2,200 people on the waiting list for the fair deal scheme and although the Minister said there was an average waiting time of 14 weeks, I find cases of people waiting up to 20 weeks. What people do not understand is that this is not 20 weeks after a person applies but after he or she has gone through the full assessment process. After a person's application for payment has been approved, he or she is told he or she must wait 14, 16 or up to 20 weeks. It does not take 14 to 20 weeks to get a payment. Imagine if a person applied for a social welfare payment and when it was eventually approved he or she was told it would be paid in 14 weeks. It is unacceptable. One of the reasons for the delay is the 850 delayed discharges in hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238"> I welcome the recent announcement that the HSE will convert the former Mount Carmel Hospital into a community hospital to help alleviate the problem. I can give the Minister two more suggestions to further alleviate it, of which the Minister will be aware. Abbeyleix District Hospital in County Laois is a community hospital which the Minister is running down. With a tiny investment, it could take 50 people. However, it is not taking new patients except for respite cases. The same applies to St. Brigid’s Hospital in Shaen, Portlaoise. With a small investment, it could take 30 or 40 people. I ask the Minister to consider those to help solve the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239"> I have come to the conclusion that the delayed discharge is not just a financial decision but a HSE policy. Although some people will say there is nowhere to discharge these 850 people, I believe there is a policy in the HSE and the acute hospitals to keep them in the beds because when they are full, they can stop new people from coming in through accident and emergency. In the past month, I have visited two accident and emergency departments in respect of a person aged well over 90, in very poor health and suffering from an illness. When the person's family suggested that the hospital should keep the person overnight, there was pandemonium. The hospital staff said there were enough people sleeping in the accident and emergency unit that night and that with 12 people in the wards they could not take in any more people. They wanted to send him home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240"> A few weeks later, the same patient ended up in Naas General Hospital, and when I visited, one could not get in the door of the accident and emergency unit. There were beds in both sides of the corridor backed up to the front door of the accident and emergency unit, head to toe. One could not get through the place. There was no room to wheel a bed or a chair in an emergency situation. Old and young sick people were lined up, head to toe, on trollies on both sides of the corridor, never mind getting into the unit. The nurses were right to take to the streets two or three weeks ago to protest what was happening in the hospital. It was unsafe and unfair on the staff, never mind the loss of dignity and medical care that should have been provided to the patients. It was not the fault of the nursing staff, but the physical infrastructure was far too small.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241"> In some parts of the country, orthodontic treatment does not exist at school level. In County Laois in the midlands, a child is lucky to be assessed by sixth class and might wait until the age of 16, almost finished secondary school, before receiving any treatment. Killeshin is in south County Laois on the border with County Carlow. While the children in County Carlow will be assessed in fourth class and receive treatment before they leave primary school, down the road in Killeshin national school, the children are in a different county and region. Did nobody tell anybody we have a national HSE? It still operates on the basis of county boundaries. Even more bizarrely, children in Carlow who happen, for family reasons, to attend the school in Killeshin in County Laois, will not receive orthodontic treatment because they are going to school in Laois even though they are from Carlow, where everybody else can get the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242"> The situation regarding the income limit of €900 per couple for medical cards is farcical.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">The Health Service Executive uses that figure of €900 when it suits it and disregards it when it suits it. In the cases to which I refer the people were applying for discretionary medical cards. I had a case in the past week where an elderly couple were told their household income was over €900 and therefore they do not get a medical card. They applied for a discretionary card. They looked at their legitimate outgoings as part of their medical expenses and they came in below €900, at €850. They were told that because they were above the basic figure they will now disregard the €900 when it comes to an application for a discretionary medical card, but they implement the €900 ceiling when it comes to a medical card application. I hope the Minister will fix that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1249">I welcome the contributions from all Deputies to the debate. I find it extraordinary that the Deputies opposite and the Minister criticised me for tabling this motion because what I am doing is stating the obvious. I am stating clearly that in December 2014 we will have a problem going into January 2015 in terms of the delivery of this country's health services simply because we do not have adequate funding in place to ensure we can underpin the basic services in the year ahead. As has been outlined by Deputy Fleming and others, it is not just Fianna Fáil that is saying that. The director general of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, stated it at the launch of the HSE service plan for 2015 when he was categorical in stating that the funding being provided would not be sufficient to cater for certain areas, particularly day case procedures and outpatient appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250"> While listening to the debate today I wandered onto a Fine Gael website and looked at the fair care proposals outlined by the Minister's party in advance of the general election and it is extraordinary that some of the targets it was criticising have now been well passed in terms of waiting lists, waiting times and issues with regard to the fair deal scheme, as pointed out by Deputy Fleming. It has gone backwards in many cases and what is more disturbing is that it has gone backwards in terms of the priorities it set.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251"> A woman rang my office this week. She is in her late 70s. Her husband is in his 80s. He was in a nursing home. He has Parkinson's disease. She had to take him out of the nursing home because she simply cannot afford the nursing home costs while she is waiting for a fair deal bed to be made available. That is what is happening. These are not isolated cases. We are not making them up. These are happening day in, day out in the context of elderly people in our communities throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252"> As to the idea of a 20 week waiting list, that is an elderly person waiting 20 weeks for a bed, often at end of life time. We hear that the nursing homes support scheme will be improved next year and that extra funding has been made available, and we talk about a target of ten to 12 weeks. In key areas the Minister has to prioritise and I suggest looking at that particular area of the HSE service plan in terms of funding for the fair deal scheme, and also in the other key area with regard to waiting lists for day case procedures. It is simply unacceptable that we are now talking about 50,000 people waiting, and 380,000 people waiting for an outpatient appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253"> Many plaudits have been laid at the Minister's door because of his honesty and his upfront approach to the issue and the challenges facing him but to say the least, this budget is dishonest because it will not be able to sustain what it outlines. Deputy Fleming referred to some of the areas where the Minister spoke about savings being accrued and extra income streams, but some of those will not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254"> When we consider the overall context of what the Government has done in the past three years in terms of budgets, it gives us no hope or confidence that it will be able to deliver this plan with the funding underpinning it. That is the reason we highlight it on a continual basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255"> It has been said that the Minister has a better bedside manner than the previous Minister. There is no doubt about that but the diagnosis and the prognosis will be the same for the patient and in this context, the patient being the HSE itself, it will not be able to deliver on what it is trying to achieve because the Government is being disingenuous in terms of the public relations spin being put forward that somehow extra money has been delivered to the HSE service plan this year. When demographic changes and the aspirations in terms of savings and income are taken into account, the Minister is starting with a deficit next year again before we even start. I can assure the Minister that if we are all here this time next year, we will be in this House again talking about a supplementary Estimate because the service plan will not have been able to achieve what it set out to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256"> I thank the Deputies who spoke on this motion. I reject the criticisms from the other side of the House that it was put down for no other reason than to have a debate on health. It is critical that the Opposition Members highlight the failings of this Government in terms of basic funding. We are not asking for anything over and above that. I commend the motion and I ask Deputies to consider when they are sitting down that this particular budget will not sustain delivery of health services in 2015 as stated by the Deputies opposite.</p>
