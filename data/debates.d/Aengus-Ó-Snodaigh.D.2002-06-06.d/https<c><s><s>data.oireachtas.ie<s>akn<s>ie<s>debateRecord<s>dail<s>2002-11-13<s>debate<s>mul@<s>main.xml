          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The Taoiseach will agree that confidence in the Garda and the way it does its duty is a bedrock of our democratic society. Allegations, as yet unproved, from a number of sources are causing public concern about the work of the Garda. Does the Taoiseach have any plans to reform the Garda Síochána? Has the Government received a formal application for an extension of time from the current Commissioner and has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform reported to Cabinet on this and, if not, when does the Taoiseach expect he will? The vast majority of gardaí are dedicated professionals who serve in the interests of keeping the peace in the State, but they are being undermined by a range of allegations. It is critical that the public has absolute confidence and trust in the Garda.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_2">I readily agree with Deputy Kenny about confidence in the Garda, it is vital for our citizens and the normal practice of democracy and the rule of law that it can carry out its functions in a way that wins the respect and support of the public. We all want this. I also accept there are matters of concern on a number of fronts, particularly allegations made at the Morris tribunal. The ultimate report is a matter for another day, but even the fact the allegations have been made creates concern. The quality of the men and women who make up the Garda Síochána is second to none, at home and abroad, and they would be the first to denounce activities that are not in full compliance with the law. The Garda Síochána Bill is being prepared and will reform many areas. It will be presented before Easter.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">Training has been enhanced in recent years and the operational units have been restructured. Many divisions have been arranged to include specialist units to deal with issues such as white collar crime, drugs and other criminal activities and they have been remarkably successful. We must, however, keep a careful watch on issues  that discredit the Garda and see how we can manage them, the point the Deputy makes in his question. A small minority are involved, but, unfortunately, they take up a lot of time. We cannot ignore them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_4">The allocation for Garda training has been cut by €11 million this year. Does the Taoiseach consider, in the context of the Bill to reform the Garda that will be before the House before Easter, that the appointment of a Garda ombudsman would be relevant? Has the current Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, about whom I make no judgment, applied for an extension and has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform reported to Cabinet on the matter? When does the Taoiseach expect him to do so?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_5">Capital investment in Templemore and its output in the last five years is at the highest level ever. This has helped morale, and changed the age structure of the Garda, something that was an issue seven years ago. The issues raised by the Deputy and others will be dealt with in the debate on the reform of the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The Garda Commissioner has almost another year remaining on his contract and has not made a formal application for an extension, although that is not unusual at this early stage. We will do our utmost to introduce the Garda Síochána Bill before Easter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_7">Have the Taoiseach's early morning beavers drawn to his attention the latest report by the Combat Poverty Agency, carried out by Professor Mary Daly of Queen's University, Belfast, showing what life is like after the Celtic tiger in some of the more disadvantaged urban and rural communities? People are living on an average of €124 per week, with children on €50. Half of them are struggling with debt and a third are living with serious health problems arising from poverty. Half of them are living in fear in Dublin. Children are being bullied at school because they do not have the latest designer gear and are often attacked as a result. In one case, a 14 year old girl was hospitalised after an attack by her peers. Is it not a scandal that this is the reality of disadvantaged urban and rural communities after all the years of affluence?</p>
          <p eId="para_8">There has been no significant transfer of resources to the areas in question. The Taoiseach promised the RAPID programme to tackle disadvantage two years ago, but not €1 has been paid out since. This was another stunt coming up to the general election to convey the caring side of Fianna Fáil when dealing with real disadvantage. The report, however, shows the reality for the communities concerned. People are besieged in their homes, living in fear with no adequate Garda protection or policing. Will the Taoiseach tell the House what the Government intends to  do in the next budget about the report of the Combat Poverty Agency?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_6">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_9">This and more recent Combat Poverty reports have shown that there has been an improvement. It has shown very clearly, taken on the same benchmark as the NAPS used in 1996, that there are about 400,000 people out of the relative poverty net – as against the 14% six years ago it is now about 6%. We have also seen across the areas with which Deputy Rabbitte and I are both familiar, an enormous amount of investment in deprived neighbourhoods and an enormous increase in the number of gardaí. We have seen more money spent in these areas than has been spent in about two generations. We have seen unemployment in these areas drop from 70% and 80% a decade ago to about 10% or less. The distributional effect, taking into account not only income but the circumstances of those in relative poverty, has been increased enormously. It is not true and I categorically deny that in these communities there has not been significant benefit. Every report carried out in the last five years has shown that the distributional effect of what has happened in recent years improved the position. Of course, in the most deprived areas there are still problems which will have to be dealt with. In areas where we launched the RAPID programme, such as Bridgefoot Street, we have seen in a short period the denuding of those flats, new houses and new accommodation to high standards. I am sure Deputy Rabbitte is well aware of that happening in his own area. The improvements, extensions and developments have not eliminated all the problems – I would not dare say that – but the level of poverty has been substantially reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">In relation to bullying, on Monday I launched a booklet on bullying in schools prepared by the Department of Education and Science and other organisations. It shows bullying is a major problem, which was not identified in other generations – I acknowledge that – and sets out how it can be dealt with. It pulls together all the organisations from district health nurses to the child welfare system and the school inspectorate to deal with and tackle this issue. I acknowledge this was never done before. It has now been identified as a problem that has to be dealt with. All of these issues required resources. They have now got resources and hopefully work will continue on them.</p>

My question has to do with the likelihood of a war with the United States attacking Iraq. Has the Taoiseach evaluated the possible effects of that war not just on the people of Iraq but on this country, not only in terms of the victims of the war directly but the effects on the price of energy, Ireland being 80% dependent on fossil fuel, the effects of burning oil gas wells on global CO2 emissions, the effects of the radioactive burden from depleted uranium weapons on both victims and combatants and the knock-on effects of terrorism worldwide? In the light of the United Nations resolution has he any plan, in the event that the United States unilaterally attacks Iraq, in regard to what Ireland will do? I know he does not want the United States to unilaterally attack Iraq but if it does, and it looks likely, will Shannon Airport continue to be made available to the United States airforce? Will the Dáil have a vote on the matter? The use of Shannon Airport would involve us participating in that war. The Constitution, which is explicit, states that war shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war, save with the assent of Dáil Éireann. When are we likely to see a vote in Dáil Éireann in advance of a possible attack by the United States on Iraq?</p>

We welcome the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1441 last week which was unanimous and expressed in a unified fashion the Security Council's concerns and intentions concerning Iraq.  This achieves a position that we, with many other countries, have fought for over many months, in which the United Nations, and not some other area, will be the vehicle for trying to deal with this issue. The integrity of the UN Charter and the prerogatives of the Security Council are fully preserved in the terms of that resolution. For Ireland this is an issue of fundamental importance and we are pleased that the resolution has kept this issue within the framework of the Security Council.

It is not a mandate for military action. We support the resolution which lays down procedures which require the question of non-compliance by Iraq to be considered by a further meeting of the Security Council. The question the Deputy asked was what will happen if Iraq does not comply. It will be for the Secretary General to assess whether Iraq failed to meet its obligations and to decide on any action that may be required.

If it is breached, it will come back to the Security Council. That is what we support. The arms inspectors must report any major breaches – we have debated the Vienna Convention and the  Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, answered a question on it. If the resolution is breached, we and everybody else on the Security Council will have a decision to make. Our position is very clear.

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_82">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">The Working Group on Basic Income completed its work in March of last year. The final report was a culmination of extensive research into the broad implications of the introduction of a basic income approach. The next step involved preparing a Green Paper on Basic Income. The Green Paper has been published recently by my Department and draws on the report of the working group.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">As will be seen from the Green Paper, the introduction of the basic income concept would involve very considerable changes to our tax and social welfare systems. The Green Paper demonstrates that there is a considerable element of uncertainty in predicting the likely dynamic effects of the introduction of a basic income system. The analysis undertaken for the working group has shown some of the complexity of the forces at work.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">Many aspects of the possible dynamic and long run effects of a basic income system are only capable of being assessed on the basis of indicative material and cannot be presented with certainty. Some of the design features are, however, already known to the Irish policy system through the  child benefit programme, which has some of the basic income features for a specific grouping in the population. This, of itself, does not provide sufficient evidence to reach conclusions about a more comprehensive approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">The purpose of the Green Paper is to bring the issues to the attention of the wider community and to encourage debate. This debate should include issues of design and implementation of tax and welfare policy to increase the prospects of achieving the positive benefits of basic income while seeking to minimise those effects which might be regarded as less desirable.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_74">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_87">The Justice Commission of the Conference of Religious of Ireland has welcomed the publication of this Green Paper. It has stated that the percentage of households and persons below the income poverty line measured by the ESRI is higher than it was in 1987. Given that the richest 10% of the population are 11 times better off than the poorest 10% of the population, according to the United Nations Development Programme, and given that the gap between rich and poor has widened to €243 per week in the first five years of this Government's Administration, is this not only a manifestation but proof positive of the complete and utter failure of the Government to deal with poverty and the consequences of poverty?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_75">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_88">That is not the position. The purpose of the Green Paper is to look at ways of improving matters. We know from Combat Poverty and the ESRI that the greatest gains are at the bottom of the income scale, and that is as it should be. Policies, including budgetary policies, for the past five years have contributed not only to reducing consistent poverty by about 4% to 5% but have reduced child poverty by half, unemployment by more than half, and long-term employment from 5.6% to 1.2%.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">There has also been a strategic approach to resourcing and tackling poverty and social exclusion. Data on consistent poverty from recent surveys of the ESRI and Combat Poverty that were used for the recent NAPS review show a decline in consistent poverty from 10% to 6%. We are committed to monitoring trends in relative incomes as part of the revised national anti-poverty strategy, which was part of the programme. It is a good indication of the risk of poverty and relative income measures are also used for cross-national purposes which are used in all these programmes. This Green Paper seeks to discover whether there is another way of doing it and if the position can be improved. I have been committed for some years to an attempt to bring all sides, including policy makers, together to see if we could take the original CORI proposal and turn it into a meaningful document. That has been done in the Green Paper and people must now give their views as to whether this is the way forward or whether there are alternative ways.  There are many disadvantages in this but advantages also.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_76">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_90">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Given that the Combat Poverty Agency and the Children's Rights Alliance state clearly that the fairest way of supporting families with children is through child benefit, and that the Government's anti-poverty strategy is to eliminate child poverty by 2007, will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government is on target to achieve this ambition? Will child benefit be increased by €31.80 per month, and €38.10 at the higher rate, which would be in line with the Government's three year strategy initiated in the 2001 budget?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_77">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_91">Those matters will be dealt with in the budget. In recent years, the Government took the advice that the best way to deal with child poverty is to put money into child benefit. That is extremely expensive and perhaps has some disadvantages. However, we have consulted widely with the organisations dealing with the various arguments on how best to pay child benefit, whether that is through tax or welfare mechanisms, or direct payments. There were perhaps 12 major suggestions but the one that has the most effect in helping marginalised people and those at the bottom is child benefit. It is the most expensive because it covers the entire spectrum but it has the greatest effect and it helps those who need it most. That is why the Government went with that system.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">There was an initial three year programme and we then began a second three year programme. We must continue to put resources into this area and those resources will be decided at each budget. Enormous resources have been put into this area and the Government will continue to do that. There are those who dispute this system and those who say there are other ways, although I am not talking about organisations. I believe this is the fairest way and that is why, in the discussions on the PPF and subsequently, I argued that it was the best way if we are really interested in the elimination of poverty.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_78">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_93">It must be almost five years since the concept of this working group was committed to in principle at the request of CORI and Fr. Seán Healy. Has the Government no intention of proceeding with this concept? If that is the case, can we move on to discussing ways of tackling real poverty in this society? Can the Taoiseach confirm that his Government has no intention of running with the basic income concept?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_79">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_94">The Government did not wait for this report to tackle the problem. We have made more progress in this area than has probably ever been made, certainly in my lifetime, and the figures support that.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">I do not agree that this approach can never work although it does not operate anywhere else in the world and no other country has adopted this system. We were asked to develop a model and Deputy Rabbitte knows we have gone across the world in that development. Experts from New Zealand and nearer home have worked on this to see if it is possible to create a model. We were asked to bring it to the stage of a Green Paper on Basic Income and to try to make sense of the various arguments. That has been done and the interested organisations, including CORI, Fr. Healy and others, have brought it to this stage and allowed for a meaningful debate to discover whether this country could establish what no other country had. That is the stage it is at.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">I accept there are difficulties and that it is not an easy system to understand, in that one could set a basic income that would involve replacing existing social welfare, PRSI and personal taxation systems with a standard weekly payment system. It is not easy to visualise how that would be done and there are many problems and difficulties involved. I am not saying this could be done overnight but that is not what is asked. This is an attempt to find out whether there is a fairer and more transparent way of doing this. I have my doubts but I have pushed on to look at other systems around the world. There are no better systems than our own but many sociologists believe we could develop a fairer model than elsewhere. It is, admittedly, a partly academic exercise but it has at least been brought to a stage where many people are now taking an interest in this subject.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_97">I appreciate there are difficulties but the debate has gone on for five years while the Taoiseach has been in Government. Will he run with it or will the debate continue for another five years? Why can Fr. Seán Healy not be told the truth which is that the Government has no intention of grasping the basic income concept? Is that not the truth? Why do we continue to say "on the one hand this and on the other hand that" and "we might and we might not"? Has the Government no intention of doing this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_81">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_98">From those comments, it is clear Deputy Rabbitte has not followed the debate for the past five years. That is not what the people involved in this have asked us to do. They have asked us to bring this issue to the position of a Green Paper. Fr. Healy recognised many times in the discussions that his original concept was not working and would not work. He made many changes to his system along the way as have the social partners and others who have worked on it. This is an academic exercise to find out if we can develop a better system. I remember some years ago Deputy Rabbitte, and others in this House, saying the tax credits system would never work. It is now fully implemented and the house did not fall down.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_82">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_99">That is off the top of the Taoiseach's head. I never said that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_83">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_100">I did not say that Deputy Rabbitte said it. I said that there were plenty of people in this House who said it would never work. They said this Government would not implement it. Even in 1998, people were saying that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, would never implement it but it is now fully implemented and things go on. I am being frank with the Deputy. There are major difficulties with the attempt to make this system work. However, there are many people passionate about this concept and I have continued to pursue it. They have not asked me to implement it but to bring it to a stage where we can have a meaningful debate and devise a system and a Green Paper. I have done that. It will not be implemented in the next Finance Bill but that is not its purpose.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_101">I understand what the Taoiseach is saying about difficulties. Does he recognise that there are difficulties with the present system, given that the numbers living in relative income poverty are increasing steadily and stand at 20.9% compared to 17.4% in 1994? Does he also recognise that the concept of trying to redistribute income is unworkable under the present system?</p>
          <p eId="para_102">In welcoming the Green Paper on guaranteed basic income is the Taoiseach encouraged and will he make plans to have it implemented as quickly as possible? Does he recognise that the Green Paper states it can be achieved without any resources additional to those available to conventional options, that it will encourage people to move from the unofficial economy into regular employment and that it will provide greater equity in the distribution of income in the country, which is something that has failed to be achieved despite our economic growth regime? Does he plan the introduction of a guaranteed basic income? I am more hopeful of this than Deputy Rabbitte because it would be logical. What is the plan?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_85">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_103">I have agreed with those pressing this subject that we will continue the debate on the issue. That is what they are asking for now. They acknowledge and accept that there are difficulties with it. The Green Paper is a contribution to the debate on how best to approach reform of the tax and welfare systems. Also acknowledged and set out in the paper are the kinds of changes that would be required. Different opinions on how that change is reflected have been put forward. I have committed myself to continuing the process regardless of what happens in the PPF or post PPF talks. I have met with people involved and the Green Paper contributes to that process. I am not giving, nor have I been asked for, any commitment to those pressing this issue for the past five years. They want to examine it themselves. We have given  them the data used in the various studies to examine and we will see where it goes from there. I do not write off the idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">I have seen the social welfare and tax system change over the past number of years. Technology allows a lot more to be done now than would have been possible before. Taking the figures and other distribution effects into account, there are arguments worth researching further. I intend to do that. I will be frank and say that we are not at the stage where we could move on. There is more involved than income and there are other issues. The work done shows that the other issues can be included. One of the other issues is that 50% to 60% of people are under the normal disposable income. That factor can be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The work done, particularly that carried out by Dr. Clarke from New Zealand, showed that these factors could be built in. My Department has worked hard on this and believes it is worth continuing with the work.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_106">The Taoiseach is aware that the purpose of his Department's Green Paper on Basic Income was to facilitate and encourage further debate and discussion on the relevant issues. Does he agree that it has been unsuccessful because there is little public knowledge, awareness or debate about the concept of basic income? My party has not put forward a demand for a basic income but the issue does deserve thorough discussion particularly in the context of the fundamental review of our taxation and social welfare systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Over the past five years the richest 10% of the population has received 25% of the tax benefits and the poorest 20% a mere 5%. The Revenue Commissioners did a survey in 1997 which found that some of the top earners were paying little or nothing through the use of avoidance measures. One in five was paying tax at an effective rate of less than 5%. Will the Taoiseach support my call to repeat such a survey as part of a fundamental review of our tax system? It should include a review of the many loopholes which allow wealthy people to get away with paying little or nothing.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_87">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_108">I remind the Deputy that the last budget provided the greatest gains to those at the bottom of the income scale. In reply to Deputy Rabbitte on another question yesterday I stated that I do not like inequitable tax exemption shelters and allowances. We have closed many of those over the years and, as I was reminded, opened a few too. Sometimes it is necessary to open some. We should try to have a straight line system so people know what the tax, such as corporation tax, is and there should not be shelters behind it. It is better if the system is designed so that people know what the tax is. This country is better than most but I do not use that as an excuse. I remind the Deputy that whenever we close a tax shelter, for example when we  closed the holiday home tax incentive, there is almost a revolution in the House. I never saw so many Members seized over the issue as on that occasion.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_110">Last year when we had to reintroduce tax incentives for the commercial market there was unanimous support for that in the House because of the state of the construction industry. I was against that but could see the difficulties if it was not moved on. Many people like these concessions but I think it is better to have a straight line system where things are clear and there are as few concessions as possible, but that is not easy to achieve. We are having a review of the outstanding concessions and the Minister for Finance will probably surprise most people by closing practically all of them in the not too distant future.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_111">Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that the aim of the concept of basic income is that every individual could live with basic decency and a modest level of comfort? Will he acknowledge also that, by contrast, there is a massive problem with low wages in this economy? Does he acknowledge that the national minimum wage of €6.35 per hour, or a miserable €13,208 per year, is impossible to live on with dignity and comfort? Will the Taoiseach see that figure against the fact that Bank of Ireland says that the average house price in Dublin will rise by €4,000 in the second six months of this year? Does he acknowledge that the Government could make an immediate contribution to lessening the pressure on those on low income by taking those on the national minimum wage out of the tax net completely? He could do that immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">In the context of the Taoiseach's last reply is it not obscene that when Irish citizens are living on €6.35 an hour, other citizens who earn hundreds of millions of euro a year can legally classify themselves as tax exiles so that they do not have to pay the extra taxation they should which would help to relieve the misery and pressure on those who are in difficult circumstances? Is the Taoiseach not completely hypocritical when he says he wants to close off these loopholes and tax shelters when he was not prepared to take his own friends to task on this? He took his friend "Sundance" to his bosom to assist the white elephant at Abbotstown because he was going to make a £50 million contribution to the scheme. Is the Taoiseach not guilty of double standards in this regard? If he seriously believes—</p>

          <p eId="para_132">I know the Deputy meant to but forgot to say that he was happy that I fought  for, achieved and implemented the minimum wage. I accept his argument that it should be higher but at least he should acknowledge, and I know he will do it the next chance he gets, that we have a minimum wage that is higher than most countries. While I am unsure what action will be taken this year given that it is a budgetary matter, I agree with the Deputy that we should work as quickly as possible to try to get people on the minimum wage out of the tax net. It is the stated position of the Government and the sooner we achieve that, the better.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">Will the Taoiseach comment on the findings of the working group on basic income that showed that a significant number of those in the bottom four income deciles, that is, the lowest 40%, would be worse off on a basic income than under the current system? In that context, has the Taoiseach given any thought to the creation of a social solidarity fund or, arising from that, has he asked for or requested that further research be carried out to ensure that, if the basic income scheme is introduced, the lowest 40% of income earners would not be adversely affected? Has the Taoiseach any proposals for further research to be conducted on this?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_134">The point made by Deputy Kenny was examined because there was criticism during the course of the work that the basic income would entail a loss of weekly income for people whose social welfare entitlements would be higher than the basic rate. When this was brought to the attention of the Conference of Religious in Ireland, it had an economist produce a modified version to surmount the problem. This posited the concept of a social solidarity fund which Deputy Kenny mentioned. The idea was to cushion the impact for groups during the transition to a basic income.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">It is possible, but it is worth restating that the difficulty is that a basic income involves replacing the social welfare, PRSI and personal taxation systems. It is a major change. It replaces tax rates and credits with a standard weekly payment for all citizens. There is a concept that there could be different rates for children. That was examined and it is possible. After that, all income earned other than the basic income would be taxed at a flat rate. There is much discussion, debate and argument about what constitutes a flat rate and how it would work. The idea is that a basic income would be fairer to less well-off people.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">The current system does not work, as Deputy Kenny said, but that is not to say it is not possible to adjust it. It will take considerable examination. Having brought it to this stage, I hope the Green Paper is examined. As I said in reply to Deputy Rabbitte earlier, this is not something that will happen in a year or two. It will take a considerable time to implement it. There are those who oppose it because they believe the rate of tax required to implement it would be so excessive and punitive that it would never work.</p>

There is that argument while there is also the question of whether the public would like the basic income system. It is designed to try to get people out of the tax net. For years we debated how we could deal with the problems in the tax system and this idea came from that to try to devise a way around those problems. Lower taxes are part of the issue but are not the only part. This is the other side of the argument and the discussion will continue for some considerable time.</p>

I said there were more ways of obtaining tax from wealthy people than just through the income tax system. Wealthy people are in business. They are involved in wealth-generating activities and spend money on goods which are subject to VAT. There are other ways of obtaining tax from them. Wealthy people in any country will always use whatever system is available to lower their relative tax rate. They can use their expenses and capital investments. That is how business operates and it seems to be acceptable to the vast majority of people. Whenever people try to change that, it does not work so simply. That is the point I am making.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">I accept that and that is why I told the Deputy yesterday there is an examination of all the shelters. However, as I pointed out to Deputy Ó Caoláin, when I tried to move some of these shelters, the Deputy will recall the difficulty in which I found myself with Deputies, business groups and trade unions. It is very difficult to remove these measures because in their own way they have a knock-on effect. Having said that, we are better off having straight-line tax systems. That is why in recent years we have worked to eliminate many of the tax shelters that existed, but it is difficult to do so. Last year we saw what happened in the construction industry. If it were possible to do away with measures in one fell swoop it would be good, as I am aware from personal experience. In one budget – I think it was in 1993 – we looked at all the concessionary taxes and allowances. There were about 120 of them and we got rid of about 70 or 80 of them. This allowed me to bring down the top rate of tax by 4% in very difficult times. Obviously, getting rid of these shelters resulted in a saving.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">The Taoiseach said this issue has been discussed over a number of years. For the Green Party, it has been discussed for the past 21 years – it was a founding policy of our party. Does the Taoiseach agree there is a need for a fundamental review not only of income distribution, but also of how taxation is collected? For example, we are asking for less of a tax burden on labour through income tax and that that proportionately would be replaced by a greater tax burden on finite resources. These kinds of issues need to be addressed to ensure long-term sustainability as well as fair tax collection and distribution of income. Has this arisen as part of the discussions on the Green Paper? Those who have been dismissive of a guaranteed basic income, GBI, on the basis of increased income tax failed to see there is a need to reform taxation policy so it is not wholly reliant on income tax, which is unsustainable as well as being a disincentive for employment.</p>

Widening the system is clearly a big issue here and will continue to be so. Even excluding the ups and downs of the economic cycle, the ageing of our population will drive that. It would be remiss of us not to look at that. Within a little more than a decade that will become a real issue. The only way for this country to continue to do well is to widen the tax base. The Deputy and I do not disagree on that.</p>

Advocates of the basic income have pointed out that that amount would go considerably towards paying it. I listened with great care to what the Taoiseach had to say. Will he agree the case for basic income is made out of a rights perspective, specifically so that it could include those who are out of the tax net at either end, as a result of being too young, too poor or retired?</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I found it extraordinary that the Taoiseach stated that even where the concept of basic income had been accepted, there was no place where it had been implemented. That is not my experience of the international literature. Will the Taoiseach not agree that basic income is one of the concepts that is now in favour to help address global poverty? I cannot understand why the Taoiseach is ignoring the scandalously high cost – up to 15% – of implementing a "poor law" means test in social welfare. At the same time he is saying he needs ten or 15 years to see the case for basic income on a rights basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">People might have published documents or research findings, but I am referring to the implementation of a basic income system. I agree that we are ahead. That is because we have spent time and effort on it and I have no difficulty with it. As I said earlier to Deputies  Kenny and Sargent, the reform of the tax and social welfare systems continues and there has been more work on this Green Paper. There is considerable interest in this from the trade union movement and sociologists. I have met many of them and we have put a lot of effort into it together. They all acknowledge that we have not found the model but, equally, that child benefit, the minimum wage and the non-taxation of it are steps in the right direction. The basic income is a different system, where everybody is on the same income but one has a tax system where rates must be far higher than at present and that is the big disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">Deputy Ó Caoláin asked about the report of the Revenue Commissioners. I am not sure to which report he refers but any examination of tax shelters will concern all reports they have. Deputy Joe Higgins made a point about corporation tax. We are criticised by our European partners for having high corporation tax but many other countries have tax shelters and other hidden ways of dealing with corporation tax. They claim the basic rate of corporation tax is 40% but they do separate deals. I will not name the countries involved but I am sure Deputies will know them. When we argued our case on corporation tax in 1998, many European countries, including Germany and France who were our biggest critics, were doing individual deals and other countries have other arrangements. The real level of corporation tax in some cases is zero. Our system is far more transparent on corporation tax than the vast majority of countries.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_279">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The objective of this Bill is to ensure public safety at indoor events which of their nature are designed to be enjoyed by members of the public. The Bill gives full legal effect to the recommendations of the Hamilton committee on crowd control in respect of large scale indoor events. It will allow public authorities to prevent or control potentially unsafe concerts for the benefit of performers and the public alike. Currently there is no adequate mechanism in place to regulate public safety at indoor concerts and events. The Garda, health boards and fire authorities have limited powers prior to an event. This legislation when enacted will require promoters and organisers to demonstrate to the fire authority in advance of an event that they can run the event safely.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The Bill has the subsidiary purpose of strengthening the enforcement procedures of the Fire Services Act, 1981, as recently recommended by the report on the review of fire safety and fire services in Ireland. These proposed amendments, together with the enforcement provisions proposed in respect of the new indoor event licensing system, will enable a more immediate response to situations requiring enforcement action.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Like anyone else going out for an evening's entertainment, I would like to be assured when I go to a concert or a pub that my safety is a  priority for the people in control of the premises and this Bill aims to do just that. The Bill when enacted will ensure that public safety and crowd management will be taken into account when an event is going through the new licensing process. When taken with the Planning and Development Act, 2000, and associated regulations on outdoor events, it will mean that we will have new and updated requirements covering public safety and crowd management issues for both outdoor and indoor events.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The licensing system will apply equally to both public and private events. It is intended to address the deficiencies in the existing licensing systems with regard to crowd safety and control. The role of fire authorities relates to fire related matters and there is a need to expand and strengthen it. Licensing under the Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1890, only applied in the large cities where relevant by-laws have been implemented such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford. Licences granted under the Public Dance Halls Act, as amended, do not require specific consideration of issues of crowd control and management, structural safety at the venue, and sanitary accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">It may be appropriate to recall the background to the Bill. A committee chaired by Mr. Justice Hamilton examined the question of public safety and crowd control and reported in 1990. This committee examined in detail all safety aspects of entertainment such as concerts, and concluded that the primary responsibility for public safety should attach to the organisers and promoters of such events. The committee made a series of recommendations on public safety and crowd control, many of which have been implemented in the intervening years.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">This Bill will fully implement the principle of promoter responsibility and also a key recommendation of the Hamilton report that "all major indoor pop concert promotions where the anticipated attendance exceeds 2,000 should be licensed on an individual basis". Indeed the Bill will go further and provide the power also to regulate events with less than 2,000 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The changing nature of events and venues has led to great concern about public safety issues, particularly where young people are involved. While I have not included the attendance number thresholds in the Bill, I intend to prescribe the appropriate thresholds in regulations to be made under the Act. This will allow flexibility in classifying events and venues within approved thresholds and it will reflect the advice of fire authorities in relation to the operation of the licensing system.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Following on the recommendations of the Hamilton report, two codes of practice, on safety at sports grounds and at outdoor pop concerts, were published by the Department of Education in 1996. A tragic death which occurred at a concert in the Point Theatre in the same year gave impetus to the development and putting in place of a third code of practice on safety at indoor  concerts. An interdepartmental working group comprising representatives of my Department, together with the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda and Dublin Corporation was established to prepare the code.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The code of practice for safety at indoor concerts was published by my Department in 1998. The code reflects the general principles of safety and the organisational parameters set out in the other codes. All the codes reflect the recommendations of the report of the Hamilton committee, which examined public safety and crowd control. The code provides advice and guidance on the matters involved in the safe organisation and running of indoor concerts. The aim of the code is to help those involved in the organisation of indoor concerts to plan and manage such events safely. As indoor concerts take place in a wide variety of venues and cover a wide range of events, the guidance is set out in broad functional terms. The issue of crowd control is central to the safe running of these events and detailed guidelines are contained in the code. The code could not and did not address the issue of licensing the events to which it applies. Codes of practice will be put on a statutory basis under this Bill. Applicants must show compliance with such codes and fire authorities must have regard to relevant codes of practice when deciding on licence applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The new licensing system introduced in this Bill is based largely on the outdoor events provisions in Part XVI of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, and the Planning and Development (Licensing of Outdoor Events) Regulations, 2001, which introduced a new licensing regime for the control and proper management of largescale outdoor events. The new system will focus on crowd control and the levels of safety appropriate to an event or type of event. An event is defined as "a performance which takes place wholly or partly in a building and which is comprised of music, singing, dancing, displays of entertainment or any activity of like kind". The licensing system will be operated by fire authorities and applicants will have the right to appeal decisions to the District Court. There is also provision for the other front-line emergency services, the Garda, health boards and ambulance services, to be involved at the licensing stage and during follow-up inspections.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">As I mentioned earlier, I propose to prescribe in regulations, at the same time as the commencement of this Bill, the attendance number threshold for indoor events and classes of indoor event. It is intended that indoor events and classes of event will be categorised in a table in the regulations. This will provide the flexibility to adjust the threshold set if changing circumstances so require.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I wish to discuss the main provisions of Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill. Sections 1, 2 and 3 are standard provisions dealing with the Bill's Short Title, commencement of the Act, interpretation and ministerial expenses. Section 2 defines an indoor  event as "a performance which takes place wholly or mainly in a building and comprises music, singing, dancing, displays of entertainment or any similar activity and in respect of which members of the public may or may not attend". This will cover events run in private clubs and other events prescribed under regulations made under section 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">Section 5 contains the key provisions of the Bill and provides that an indoor event will require a licence from the fire authority and that it will be an offence to organise or run such an event without a licence. Section 6 provides for the procedures to be followed by fire authorities when making a determination in relation to an application for a licence. A fire authority will be able to impose conditions in the licence and those involved in the event will be required to have regard to codes of practice such as the code of practice for safety at indoor concerts. Section 7 states that a licence in itself will not necessarily authorise the holding of an indoor event, as compliance with other relevant codes will still be required. Section 8 makes provision for those applying for a licence, aggrieved by a decision of the fire authority, to have the right of appeal to the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Section 9 makes provision for the issue of codes of practice and notice of the codes of practice shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Section 10 outlines the general duty of care of persons involved in organising or attending an event. Section 11 empowers fire authorities to serve a notice of cessation requiring those involved to stop an event or preparations for an event, remove any temporary structures, or restore any building to its original condition where a fire authority has reason to believe that an event is likely to occur without or in contravention of a licence. Section 12 provides powers of entry on to land and powers of inspection for authorised officers and members of the Garda Síochána. Section 13 is a standard provision for the limitation of civil proceedings against the Minister, fire authorities or authorised officers in the exercise of any functions required under this Bill. Section 14 empowers the District Court to revoke a licence on application by a fire authority where a licensee has been convicted of an offence under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Section 15 deals with penalties and the prosecution of offences. Section 16 gives fire authorities the power to prosecute any summary offences committed in their functional areas. Section 17 provides that directors, officers or members of a corporate body may be liable when a corporate body commits an offence. Section 18 states that any fines imposed by a court in relation to offences under this Bill will accrue to the fire authority. Section 19 provides that fire authorities will be required to maintain a register of decisions and notices served and that the register will be open to the public for inspection during office hours. Section 20 makes provision for fire authorities to make joint arrangements to  carry out the licensing function or to provide assistance to other fire authorities. Section 21 deals with the appointment and powers of authorised officers for the licensing function under Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Section 22 is a standard provision in relation to the service of notices.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Part 3 of the Bill addresses more general amendments to the Fire Services Act, 1981, the basic legislation dealing with fire fighting and fire safety in Ireland. In the 21 years since the introduction of the Act, many changes have taken place in relation to fire safety and prevention. These changes warrant recognition in a legal context. I am aware that a number of the provisions, particularly the penalty provisions that were included in the 1981 Act, have proved to be less than effective in practice and are in need of reform. I am not proposing a fundamental review of the 1981 Act at this stage, but I intend to remedy difficulties in relation to the enforcement provisions of the Act which have been identified over the years, particularly following a legal challenge in the Supreme Court in 1993. The judgment in the 1993 case held that the Fire Services Act, 1981, contains no provision that gives a specific power to any person or body to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for offences under sections 18(2), 20 and 37 of the Act or regulations made under section 37 of the Act. The only route open to prosecute such offences is the lengthy process of prosecution through the Circuit Court on indictment. I intend in this Bill to put beyond doubt that a fire authority may take summary proceedings for an offence under the sections and regulations to which I have referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Part 3 of the Bill also addresses the issue of powers of inspection for fire authorities and fire authority inspectors under the Act. Provision is made for withdrawal of a fire safety notice. The definition of a building in the Act has been widened to include "part of a building" to deal with difficulties which have arisen in relation to issuing fire service notices to multiple occupancy buildings. Part 3 of the Bill also updates the penalty provisions of the 1981 Act to bring fines into line with current money values.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">As regards the detailed provisions of Part 3, section 23 extends the definition of "building" in the Fire Services Act, 1981, to include parts of buildings, structures or erections, thus providing the fire authorities with the flexibility to serve notices on parts of buildings. Sections 24 and 25 copperfasten the power of fire authorities to prosecute offences summarily and the sections also update the penalty provisions of the Fire Services Act, 1981. Section 26 clarifies section 18(2) of the Fire Services Act, 1981. It puts beyond doubt the duty of persons in control to make adequate provision for the safety of persons on the premises regardless of whether an outbreak of fire has actually occurred. This section also strengthens the status of advice given by a fire authority and  its inspection powers. It underpins an extended range of options, including the issuing of a warning that a fire authority could use in dealing with "persons in control".</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Section 27 makes provision for the issue of codes of practice and provides that notice of the codes of practice shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Section 28 makes statutory provision for the withdrawal of fire safety notices. Up to now there was no provision in the Fire Services Act to enable a fire authority to withdraw a notice once it had issued in relation to premises. This gave rise to considerable conveyancing difficulties for these premises. Section 29 updates provisions governing the service of notices. I am sure that the House will agree that the enactment of this legislation should be a priority to ensure that audiences attending large indoor events can rest assured that there is a crowd control and safety plan in place for their protection to ensure their safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate on its various provisions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_301">I support the Minister's sentiments in the second last paragraph of his speech. I am very mindful that in May 1996 a lady from Shanagarry, Midleton, County Cork, Bernadette O'Brien, died in the Mater Hospital when the life support machine was switched off. She suffered severe internal injuries during a crush at The Smashing Pumpkins concert in the Point Theatre in Dublin's Docklands. That tragedy was the catalyst for much of the work done since then. Following another tragedy at Hillsborough football stadium, the Government announced on 18 April 1989 that it intended to appoint a high level committee to consider all aspects of public safety and crowd control.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The committee under the chairmanship of the Honourable Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton was formally appointed on 12 May 1989 and held its inaugural meeting on that date. All meetings were held in private and the proceedings of all meetings were regarded as confidential. In order to identify clearly its area of work, the committee decided the following events would be examined. These included major soccer and GAA games, major open air concerts and events, major indoor events and concerts and major race meetings. The factors to be examined in regard to these events included overcrowding, crushes, crowd surges, fire safety, violence, structural standards and the physical layout of the venue. The final Hamilton report made 73 recommendations, many of which referred to indoor pop concerts. The key recommendations in regard to indoor pop concerts included, first, that all major indoor pop concert promotions anticipating an attendance exceeding 2,000 should be licensed on an individual basis by the District Court and, second, a minimum of two months notice should be provided in an application for a licence for a major indoor or outdoor pop concert promotion.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Despite the fact the Committee on Public Safety and Crowd Control under Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton reported in February 1990, it was 24 October 1996 before an announcement was made in Dáil Éireann by the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, that the question of safety at indoor concerts would be examined and a voluntary code of practice on the issue would be put in place. The working group, chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, was appointed by me to take responsibility for the preparation of the voluntary code of practice under the chairmanship of Ray Dollard from the Department. It involved personnel from the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda, the sports section of the Department of Education and Science and Dublin Corporation. While the code of practice for safety at indoor concerts was published in 1998, we are at long last, four years later, getting this legislation, which I welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The code of practice comes under 13 headings. It proposed that premises used for indoor concerts would be subject to licensing or registration under a number of statutory codes and that if premises involved were ordinarily used for music, singing or other public entertainment, a licence should be obtained in certain urban areas in which Part IV of the Public Health (Amendment) Act had been adopted by the urban authority. It recommended that promoters should consult with the relevant urban authority for information as to whether Part IV of the Act had been adopted locally. Under the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, as amended by the Licensing Act, 1997, a licence should be required for any place where public dancing is proposed to take place. It recommended that this requirement would apply in regard to indoor events where dancing takes place. Licences under these Acts would be obtained from the District Court and conditions could be imposed limiting the numbers to be admitted and specifying precautions to be observed in regard to crowd control and similar matters. It recommended that these licences would be renewable on an annual basis and that there would be provision for the granting of a temporary licence in respect of music and singing or public dancing for 14 days and one month, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">It also made recommendations regarding the Licensing Act, 1997, specifically in relation to combating drug abuse; the Intoxicating Liquor Acts; the Fire Services Act, 1981; the ease of escape regulations, 1985; the means of ingress and egress; temporary structures and the Planning Acts, 1963-93; the Building Control Act, 1990; and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989. It also made recommendations regarding civil liability; the Criminal Justice Public Order Act, 1994; the Casual Trading Act, 1995; the food hygiene regulations, 1950-89; the Children Act, 1908; the Children Bill, 1996; and the Litter Pollution Act, 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">As I already said, this legislation arises from the Hamilton report as well as the code of practice for safety at indoor concerts. The code of practice for safety at indoor concerts followed the same general principles of safety and the organisation of parameters set out in other codes. It reflected the recommendations of the Hamilton committee on crowd control. It set out the minimum functional requirements for the safe organisation and management of concerts. It provided practical guidance and advice for promoters on a wide range of parameters relevant to crowd control such as event planning and management, crowd management, the use of barriers, stewarding and emergency and medical facilities. Other aspects dealt with fire precautions and fire safety, structural matters, electrical installation and communications. The code pointed out that indoor concerts take place in a wide variety of venues and covered a wide range of events. For that reason the code was set out in broad functional terms with the requirements to be adopted to the needs of the particular event. The code never intended to apply to the small type of events held in pubs and discos. Admittedly it was a voluntary code because the history and experience with the two previous codes was that up to then a voluntary and flexible approach worked well.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">At the time it was stated that the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, would examine the issue of licensing indoor concerts including the implementation of the recommendation made by the Hamilton committee on crowd control on the licensing of indoor concerts with audiences of above 2,000 people and the role local authorities might play in such a licensing system. Even though the legislation is welcome, I am concerned that it took so long to come before this House. Following the Hamilton Committee Report, 1990, the committee to draw up the code of practice was established. The code was published in 1998 and four years later we are debating the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Over the years there were a number of tragic events both in this country and outside it. I referred already to the tragedy in the Point Theatre. One of the major tragedies occurred on 3 December 1979, at The Who concert in Cincinnati which ranked as the most horrific rock concert event ever. Some 11 rock fans were crushed to death and scores were injured because of the gross crowd management failings. Many people associated with the concert recall that night in disbelief. Many of them have told their personal stories which we have read. A landmark report on concert safety in regard to crowd management was published in 1998 by the Cincinnati Citizen Task Force. It contained many recommendations designed to prevent a repeat of that disaster. Among the report's most important recommendations were two from chapter 7. One was that the Internal Association of Auditorium Managers  should develop crowd management standards for facility operators and event promoters and that the same organisation should develop incentives or sanctions to encourage its members to meet these standards. However, promises made to have recommendations implemented were never fulfilled.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Instead of working towards industry standards and producing a definitive crowd management study, the vested interests detoured to a lower road and began sponsoring well-choreographed conferences and seminars that were steered away from discussions of key safety studies and standards from which we should learn. One can only wonder how many lives might have been saved throughout the world and how many injuries might have been prevented had an international code of standards been drafted and, more importantly, implemented. The task force that was set up after The Who concert tragedy proved that serious study could produce reasonable results and guidelines and communities around the country showed that concert safety laws were workable.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">One of the excuses given for not implementing the task force report was that all concert events were different, and that is true in some ways. However, the British Government demonstrated that standardised guidelines were possible and in 1993 the health and safety commission of the Home Office and the Scottish Office published the Guide to Health, Safety and Welfare at Pop Concerts and Similar Events. The "pop guide" contained 145 pages of excellent commentary and guidelines and is currently used by concert promoters and staff throughout the UK. The impetus for this came from the deaths of two rock fans at a 1988 festival.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">This legislation is long overdue because of the proliferation of concerts, the risk of avoidable disasters and the profile of concert audiences, a large segment of which consists of teenagers and children. One of the most horrific tragedies to have occurred was at the Roskilde festival in Copenhagen in 2000, where eight people were trampled to death when the crowd rushed the stage on a tragic Friday night. This was an outdoor concert, but there are lessons to be learned. It could just as easily have happened at an indoor concert because the fans apparently pushed towards the stage in an effort to hear the music after loudspeakers failed at the rear of the stadium.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Arising from that tragedy a presentation was made to the Danish committee on concert and festival safety by Mr. Paul Wertheimer, who was involved in the Cincinnati study. He made four major points: tragedies such as the one in Copenhagen had to be viewed in the context of crowd management; the search for comprehensive standards and safety legislation would be a disappointing one because, he said, no one region or country is doing everything right when it comes to concert safety; safety laws, standards or guide lines, or a combination of these, are needed to prevent future disorders and tragedies; and concert and festival safety could be significantly improved if the inherent dangers of seating are addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">In relation to codes and laws that work, he said there were two significant reasons safety legislation and guides were needed. Concerts and festivals have grown to become major attractions and have increased in number, size and complexity. Generally speaking, existing laws in most communities do not address the peculiarities of live pop music events. By "peculiarities" he was referring to activities such as crowd-surfing, when a person is carried above a crowd; pogoing, jumping up and down in place; moshing; crowd surges; crowd collapses; crushes and provocative actions by performers. Because of these and other safety challenges the establishment of safety procedures for concerts and festivals is developing into an international trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I have not attended many major indoor pop concerts but I believe there is still much to be done to ensure that crowd management strategy recommendations are fully complied with. Full information should be posted at venues about venue rules and policies; entrance and exit locations, first aid rooms and door openings; special services for the disabled, elderly and children; prohibited items and crowd activities and penalties; updates on performance schedule changes; information and maps for emergencies; and anticipated sound and noise levels inside the concert site. How many of these are being implemented at present? I ask the Minister whether concert organisers are obliged to have a report on first aid data and arrest information so that music fans, parents, the medical profession, crowd safety consultants, safety and law enforcement officials and legislators will be better able to judge the safety of events in their communities. If this procedure was followed it would also help the event organisers, artists and contract staff with the best safety records to receive the recognition they deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Much of the concert scene today is greatly influenced by international youth pop culture and the concert industry. Concert production and culture are not provincial or even national products. They are growing less parochial and more international by the day. Codes of practice and legislation must recognise this international influence so that we can understand and deal with the reasons audiences, performers and organisers act as they do. Irish music culture is heavily layered with international influences coming from lots of sources and perhaps the most pervasive, if not influential, is America's MTV. The images, music, opinions and news it carries reach more than 35 million households in 139 countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">MTV is not the only influence, however. Young people, including children, are being inundated with many persuasive influences, coming from too many sources to list. One of the most shocking, as demonstrated recently, was a cata logue by the toy-maker LEGO whose cover picture showed an easily discernible LEGO character crowd-surfing in a stadium. This is a small example of what is being communicated to youngsters. It says that crowd-surfing is fun and the thing to do. Those developing policies, guidelines and legislation must understand how popular youth values and mannerisms are born, promoted and perpetuated so that we may have more effective crowd safety techniques for events attended by young people and adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">This legislation and the creation of new standards for concerts and indoor events in Ireland will be some of the few positive actions to come from tragedies at pop concerts. The lessons of tragedies should not be forgotten because too often when a tragedy occurs, people and special interest groups are eager to erase the memory and the evidence of the incident. Lessons learned are ignored and forgotten, with the loss of life, injuries and property damage, and this can be a costly and tragic mistake. If we fail to learn the lessons of the past we are condemned to repeat our errors. All music fans, youth culture media, safety officials, parents and legislators need to remember our mistakes and not hide them if we want to find ongoing remedies for evolving situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">I welcome the Bill. I am studying this element of it in detail so that we can deal with the provisions in more detail on Committee Stage. I welcome the updating of the part of the Bill dealing with fire safety. We can have all the legislation and regulations we want, but I am convinced that fire safety regulations as well as safety regulations of all sorts have a poor level of implementation and enforcement. I mentioned this last night during our debate on the motion relating to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. Local authorities do not have the resources to enforce the existing regulations. A recent study was done by a Sunday newspaper about the quality of accommodation being offered to students in this city. There were dozens of cases of substandard accommodation, fire traps and death traps, yet the local authorities do not appear concerned. I can give examples from my city of people who live in hovels. They have no chance of escape in case of fire and the building regulators or fire department do not enforce the regulations. They seem to be ignored and there will be tragedies.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">We will pass this Bill with some amendments but we should ensure the legislation is implemented, which is not happening. Local authorities tell me they have a lot of regulations to enforce but do not have the manpower or resources to do so and the poorest and weakest suffer as a result. Business people who cut corners and ignore safety laws are exploiting the lack of enforcement and some people's unfortunate circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I welcome the Bill. We must learn from the past but we must also be vigorous in enforcing the existing laws.</p>

          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_321">If this is the Deputy's first occasion in the Chair I congratulate him as, although it is an honour, it must be fairly daunting.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I speak instead of Deputy Gilmore, who is unfortunately absent because of family circumstances. He will deal with the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Listening to the Minister and Deputy Allen, it occurs to me that the old saying is true, one cannot put an old head on young shoulders. The young are adventurous by nature. They see no danger in anything and they are inclined to be more energetic than those of us here, and that includes everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">People, particularly the young, have more disposable income now. After what was said last night about the Minister for Finance, that might sound like a contradiction but it is not. In my day we saved for a deposit to buy a house. That notion is pie in the sky to young people. For them all their income is disposable as there is no longer any point in saving. There is nothing one can do with what one saves, therefore all one's income is disposable. That is why indoor and outdoor events have become increasingly popular. If we went to two concerts in a year when we were young, they would have been major events but people now go to concerts no matter what the cost. They will travel and stay overnight because they have more disposable income.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">I am not going to go into all the tragedies which have led to this legislation. I welcome the Bill, which is timely. It is good legislation. The tragedies which have led to the Bill have left scars on the families of those injured or maimed. They do not need reminding of those tragedies, as they will never forget them. Neither can one prevent tragedies from happening. We are going to encounter such tragedies again and again but if they occur it should be as a result of something we have not foreseen. When we introduce legislation to protect people we should try to envisage every possible event and action people are capable of taking which could cause injury to others. We all hope nothing like this will happen again but if it does it should be as a result of something unforeseen. The Bill goes a long way towards ensuring that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I am glad the Minister referred to numbers, saying he will not go along with the original recommendation regarding events of more than 2,000 people but that he will go for fewer numbers. All of us have been in venues – not the Point or other major venues – where we have felt uncomfortable and unsafe. One checks where exits are but sometimes the exit is a very narrow stairway leading to a basement thronged with people who are drinking and in high spirits. One wonders if the lights went out, let alone a fire breaking out, how people would find their way out of such venues. The Minister knows that such venues are within a roaring distance of the Chamber. On certain nights when people are out to enjoy themselves – either for a person's birthday or simply at the weekend – they are  crammed into venues with no safety exits or crowd control. They are unsafe and I am glad the Minister will deal with venues holding less than 2,000 people, as it is very important. People can be injured, maimed or even killed in crowds far smaller than those indicated in the original committee report.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The Minister should re-examine section 11, as it is of serious concern to those in the fire service. They say section 11 does not allow for immediate action to be taken and their explanation makes good sense. For instance, a fire officer or some other person charged with responsibility at a major event may find an exit door at an event is blocked – maybe not by furniture or amplifiers, but by the crowd. He or she cannot take immediate action and if something happens that night, when the fire exit may be necessary to release crowds from the venue, taking action the next morning is too late. While I agree with Deputy Allen regarding the lack of personnel to police venues, such personnel may not be able to take immediate action. This can be altered in section 11.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The Minister rightly spoke about ensuring that when people go into venues they should feel secure and safe. That is what the legislation is about and I am sure on Committee Stage the Minister will listen to the reservations and concerns of those who will be charged with ensuring the legislation is implemented. Deputy Gilmore will deal with the Bill on Committee Stage and he will have much to say. The Bill is welcome and those of us who are parents will be relieved to know our children are safe when they go to these events. Young people are energetic and full of life. They see little wrong with crowd-surfing or moshing, even though we as parents are horrified by them being involved in those activities. With proper restrictions and regulation we can ensure they are safe and that they will return from enjoyable occasions.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_331">It is easy to welcome this Bill and acknowledge the good work that has been done. More than 21 years after the Stardust disaster, however, the question remains to be asked why there are still no quality procedures in the leisure industry. Why is it only after tragedies such as the Stardust or The Smashing Pumpkins concert at the Point Depot that we, as legislators, recognise the pressing need to formulate laws and legal codes that effectively protect people to whom we owe the responsibility to govern adequately?</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the licensing of certain indoor events and  place a code of practice on a statutory basis for them. When the code was originally announced by the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, his statement asserted that it would set out a minimum functional requirement for the safe organisation and management of concerts. While there has been some improvement in the quality and safety of venues, standards vary hugely across the State and there are still many flea pits. While such venues might not hold any attraction for more mature Members of this House, they are often filled with our children, who throng to these dives. It is with some concern, therefore, that I note the code of practice is not intended to apply to the smaller type of event held in pubs and discos. Why not? It should apply to all events.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">It was recognised by the former Minister, Deputy Dempsey, last year that the report of the interdepartmental review group on public safety recommended that the codes of practice should be placed on a statutory basis and that public safety should be placed high among the concerns to be addressed in decision making and in the development of policy. If the past or present Ministers really believed this was the case they would ensure that all venues are included under the terms of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">We are told that the expenses incurred in the administration of the Bill will be paid out of money provided by the Oireachtas. Why not ask the promoters of events to contribute towards the cost of ensuring safety standards at indoor events or concerts they are organising?</p>
          <p eId="para_335">While it is right that the code of practice envisaged by the Bill need not be part of the legislation, there are gaps in the background and purpose of the Bill. It focuses entirely on the venues where events are taking place and not on the promoters of events and their responsibilities. Promoters and performers are usually not the owners of the venues. There should be a code of practice, guidelines and, where necessary, sanctions for them too. Most importantly, there is no mention of the rights of customers and audiences, the standards they should expect at a concert venue and the level of safety the promoters of events must provide for them. Those should form a central part of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The Bill confers considerable powers on the Minister to determine the licence criteria for these events. Why is so much power given to the Minister? Is he really the competent authority in this regard? The Bill should provide more detail on the required high standard of public safety. It empowers the Minister to draw up the relevant codes of practice but we have not seen a draft of these codes. It is strange that it is accepted practice to pass Bills without seeing the small print.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">We need the best possible legislation to ensure safety at all indoor and outdoor events. Failure at this stage could easily result in tragedy later. We must show that we have learned from the past. A concert-goers' bill of rights should include the right to enjoy a concert in a safe environment,  be treated with respect by facility management, concert security, entertainers and promoters regardless of race, sex, appearance or disabilities and be informed of the responsibilities of the ticket holder and the concert facility's house rules prior to the purchase of a ticket. It should also include the right to be notified in a timely manner of changes in the performance, door opening time or other information affecting the safety or enjoyment of a concert and a provision requiring the posting at a concert of the names and addresses of the facility's management, the performers' agents or promoters and the concert security firm.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">These are the salient issues and I will address them on the later Stages of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would receive a lecture from Fine Gael on the dangers of crowd-surfing in this House, not only on crowd surfing by people but by Lego characters. Deputy Allen made moshing, pogo dancing and crowd surfing sound as if they were unsavoury sexual practices rather than the natural tendencies of younger people. We must get real with this legislation and acknowledge what young people get up to. If Fine Gael had its way, we would all be sitting quietly tapping our feet at a James Last concert in the National Concert Hall rather than allowing young people to indulge in what they do best – enjoying themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">This Bill is welcome but it does not make up for the need to enforce and revise existing codes where appropriate. There is a danger in the quick fix solution. Wearing my architect's hat, I am well aware of the plethora of codes governing the use of public buildings: planning provisions, building controls, liquor licensing and fire safety certification. I am nervous, however, that we are adding another layer of bureaucracy. There should be a fundamental revision of the present codes, some of which date back to the 1840s, such as the liquor licensing code. The dancing codes, which date from the 1930s, should also be revised. God knows what the legislators of that time would have to say about where and to what we should be dancing.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">A fundamental reassessment of the ability to take effective action at a concert is required. On a live album by The Doors, recorded in Los Angeles, Jim Morrison, of all people, can be heard saying that the fire marshall said people had to return to their seats or he would close the place down. That is what we need here, the fire officer or the gardaí must be able to say at a moment's notice that a venue should be closed down and take effective action. We must be able to respond quickly to unfortunate events such as those that occurred in the Point Depot.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Reforms should be carried out under the auspices of local authorities and the fire officers. Fundamental changes are required so the different agencies can work together. The gardaí deal with liquor licensing and must review plans at the courts. They do not have a background in reading plans so how can they enforce legislation in that  area? Planners, conversely, have little control over liquor licensing, demonstrating the many conflicts in existing legislation. While this Bill is a step in the right direction, there must be a more fundamental revision.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">I like going to venues where people are crammed close together, be it in Fibber Magee's on Parnell Street or elsewhere. There is a danger in going too far with regulation. I went to a concert given by the Buena Vista Social Club in Smithfield where the audience were put into pens all the way up through the space in the square and there was very little atmosphere at a gig that should have been full of emotion, passion and love of music. Instead we were corralled into enclosures. A balance must be struck and the legislation goes some way towards that but we must review the wider legislation governing behaviour at public events while also dealing with the specifics in this Bill. I look forward to tabling amendments on behalf of the Green Party on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_344">I welcome this Bill as an innovative measure to license indoor entertainment events and cater appropriately for issues such as crowd control planning and safety of patrons and spectators. While the Bill largely deals with the licensing process for the holding of certain indoor events and the development of a code of practice for safety at indoor concerts, I am happy to note that the duty of care which devolves to the promoters and organisers of such indoor events is afforded a statutory foundation. Had this Bill been in force at the time of the Stardust disaster and the Bundoran Central Hotel fire neither venue would have qualified for a licence on fire safety considerations alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Crowd management is one of the cornerstones of the Bill in terms of patron safety. Section 10(1) and (2) refer, in particular, to the statutory duty which makes it incumbent on the licensee to take all reasonable care to ensure the safety of persons attending the event. Conversely, there is also a statutory duty on all attending the event to conduct themselves in such a manner as not to expose others to danger as a consequence of their actions in so far as is reasonably possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Efficient crowd management results in enhanced experiences for performers, fans and the attendance in general. I suggest that the drawing up of a code of conduct for spectators by an applicant for a licence be included in the Bill as a prerequisite for the issue of a licence. The code can be printed in the programme or on posters or signs hung close to the box office. Consideration should also be given to emergency procedures for the following: drinking or possession of alcoholic beverages; possession, use or sale of drugs; bomb threats; medical emergencies; equipment failures; power failures and plans from emergency evacuation.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I note that the fire authority will be required to have regard to the codes of practice for crowd  safety at indoor concerts in assessing licence applications. In assessing an application for a licence section 6(3) <i>(c)</i> provides that the fire authority shall have regard to the provision of adequate facilities for the health and welfare of patrons attending the indoor event, including the adequacy of sanitary facilities. In the past such a provision has obviously been honoured more in the breach than in the observance. Since sanitary facilities at many venues up and down the country leave much to be desired, I trust this subsection will be rigidly enforced with high standards being sought rather than merely adequate provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">In addressing the issues of crowd management and public safety and considering the merits or demerits of licence application, the Bill makes a valuable contribution towards having in place an up-to-date and comprehensive licensing system for indoor events for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_351">I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the Licensing of Indoor Events Bill, 2001. In essence the Bill arises from the need to implement the recommendation of the Hamilton committee on crowd control. The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for the licensing of certain indoor events by the fire authorities. The Bill also provides for the strengthening of the enforcement provisions of the Fire Services Act, 1981. I would like to dedicate my speech to the families and victims of the terrible Stardust fire. I represent that area and it is essential that we never forget the pain and suffering of the Stardust families. At the time of that tragedy the country was overcome with grief and it is up to us now as legislators to ensure that this never happens again.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">By the way, it is not totally up to the fire authorities or the Government to ensure public safety and fire safety. A collective effort is needed, involving the public, owners of premises, organisers of event, the Garda, the fire authorities and local authorities. We all have a duty to ensure that indoor events are safe for our friends, families and neighbours. Sitting on the fence is not an option in regard to public safety in these types of events.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Section 20 provides that fire authorities may make arrangements to carry out the licensing function jointly or to provide assistance to other fire authorities. I had the recent honour of attending a cross-Border event on fire safety where both fire services, North and South, under the direction of the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, came together in Marino to work on fire  safety initiatives to save and protect lives. These are the types of projects that must be welcomed and developed on the island because they make common sense. As far as I am concerned, I cannot wait for the day when we will have one good strong fire service on the whole island. We have to ensure we get the right people into our fire services and, above all, pay them well. The treatment of fire fighters in Britain, where there was a recent strike, is a disgrace. We should all support them in their campaign for a decent wage and we should ensure that all our fire fighters are well looked after. These people risk their lives for our communities and this should be recognised in their wages and their terms and conditions of employment. This is an essential part of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Section 18 provides that fines imposed by a court will accrue to the local authority. This is common sense as all local authorities need more funds to develop their services in the interest of all our people. Funding of local government has become a major issue in recent years. Section 18 provides a creative way of funding. These imaginative ideas should be tried in all Departments in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">In Part 3, amendment of Fire Services Act, 1981, the definition of "building" is clearly defined to include "structures or erections". This will provide the fire authority with the flexibility to serve notices on parts of the buildings. This is a progressive step in the interests of fire safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Section 26<i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> put beyond doubt the duty of persons in control, whether an outbreak of fire has occurred, to ensure the safety of persons on their premises. Section 26<i>(b) </i>strengthens the status of advice given by a fire authority and strengthens its inspection powers. I welcome these developments in fire safety, but let us remember the families and victims of the Stardust fire in Artane. Let us dedicate all our fire safety legislation to these people and to the other victims around the country and ensure that this legislation means something in practical terms for the ordinary people of this country.</p>

I wish the Chairman well. Even though I have been here 160 days, I have not had the opportunity previously of speaking in a debate at which the Minister, Deputy Cullen, was present. He is a politician for whom I have great regard. I am very impressed by the progressive manner in which he is attacking his brief. I wish him every success with the difficult issues he will have to tackle within his remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I am particularly pleased to welcome this Bill which will give effect to the recommendations of the Hamilton Committee report. When it comes to public safety and crowd management, it is necessary to be vigilant and ensure that we do not become observers of or, worse, participants in a  tragic event. With the increased popularity of large entertainment events and festivals all over the country and the marketing of these occasions as an ideal leisure weekend, more and more people are attending. Organisers are clearly aware of the economic benefits to both themselves and the local economy and will try to accommodate the maximum number. With our unreliable weather, indoor facilities in marquees, purpose-built halls or pubs will always be a necessary requirement for such events. The need for the fire services to vet and, where appropriate, licence these events is an essential part of the support that the State should ensure exists to protect all our citizens. The licensing of indoor events in terms of crowd control and safety procedures may appear intrusive to some but, in the event of an emergency, such procedures save people from injury or even fatality.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The Bill provides that certain indoor events will require a licence. While not wishing to increase costs to either operators or the public, I urge the Minister to extend the need for such a licence to as broad a range of events as possible. I am aware that all indoor events take place in buildings with the necessary planning permission. I have on occasion attended events where the number of people in attendance was excessive and information as to what to do in an emergency was minimal. Unlike my colleagues I am unable to rattle off a whole range of popular events I have attended, but I do go to the odd event. I ventured out a few weeks ago to the Point to see Cliff Richard, which was a good event. I had the opportunity to see how good crowd control can be and how the initiative of staff can be brought into play to avert the danger of a potential crush. During the interval, as people wanted to access the facilities, buy things and relax for a few minutes, a lot of people suddenly converged on one particular spot. The initiative of the staff that night was second to none. I am not suggesting there was any danger, but the staff were responsive. It is good for the public and all of us who go out to be able to have confidence in what is going on about us.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The ratio of people at any event, whether in a large commercial building, local committee or sports club or the lounge area of the local pub, should be in proportion to the space available so that all can have a good time and enjoy themselves safely. In addition, the requirement to point out the safety arrangements and emergency exits to those attending an event should be mandatory, and I am glad that is often done. At a function I attended a couple of weeks ago which the Taoiseach also attended, the master of ceremonies, despite the kind of event it was, went through that process. That is good and positive. There is no reason why there should not be an announcement over the sound system at every event, similar to that already used in theatres and cinemas.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The proposed issuing of a licence for one year against a specific application which details the  facilities provided at a particular venue is both fair and reasonable. I hope the Minister will explore the possibility of authorising the Garda Síochána to carry out random inspections of licensed events to ensure the numbers in attendance are within agreed limits. To facilitate spot checks, operators should be required to operate numbered and dated tickets for issue to attendees through public and on-site notices, requested to seek the entrance tickets when not offered one, and to make that very clear through the notices.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">I hope the Minister and his officials are placing the effectiveness of this Bill squarely on the fire service with specific performance indicators as to the delivery of the service to the applicant and the right of appeal to the District Court where the applicant is unhappy with the decision of the fire service. I hope that in this period of budgetary constraints the fire service will have in place before the Bill is signed all the necessary manpower and resources to deliver a quality customer service to applicants and, more important, to the people who will be attending licensed events. Too often in the past good legislation passed in this House has been let down by our inability to provide the supports necessary to make it work, or the delay in setting up the full supports has come back to embarrass us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The codes of practice for indoor events must be both plain and effective with the operator having to go that extra mile to ensure everyone's safety. The ability of local authorities to issue a notice of cessation where an event is planned and where the necessary licence had not been granted adds further strength to the effectiveness of this Bill. It is important that those of us who represent major population centres have an opportunity to debate these issues and to contribute to various discussions on legislation coming before this House. That is why I am happy to have been able to participate this morning. Like other colleagues, I bring to this House my experience of living in a major population centre. As I go about my business in Tallaght, Greenhills, Templeogue and Firhouse, I listen to what my constituents are saying. They are very clear about the business to which this Bill relates and they want us to represent their concerns. We read every day in the media about people's concerns about the matters covered by the Bill. For that reason I am happy to support it. The technical sections of the Bill and the amendments to the Fire Services Act, 1981 will further strengthen its effectiveness. I wish the Minister well. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern and wish him well in his position. I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_255">
          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_364">The Hamilton Committee was established in 1989 following the high profile tragedy at a football stadium in Hillsborough. The committee examined standards in relation to safety, including fire safety, overcrowding, violence, structural standards and so on. The committee made more than 70 recommendations. However, this Bill deals mainly with the fire  safety regulations in relation to indoor leisure pursuits. It has taken 13 years from the time the Hamilton Committee was set up to have the legislation on the floor of the Dáil. That is an inordinate length of time for an issue as pressing and vital as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Like Deputy O'Connor, I too listen to my constituents on these matters. I gather from my own offspring and from other young people I meet in the constituency that security and crowd control at concerts and events often leaves much to be desired. While stewards and those in charge act in the best interests of participants and those who attend events, their actions sometimes leave much to be desired. I did not notice our spokesperson giving a lecture. Deputy Cuffe is very sensitive if he feels the Fine Gael spokesperson was lecturing him on what goes on at concerts. Members of Fine Gael live in the real world in the same way as members of other parties. Fine Gael members meet their constituents regularly and have families of their own. I have four children who regularly attend such events. When we speak in the Dáil, we speak from our experience and reflect the views of our constituents. The Fine Gael spokesperson was simply putting on record what happens at concerts and other events and there should be no sensitivity about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">There is greater international influence on our young people regarding behavioural experience and attitudes at pop concerts. Whether we like it or not, we must address the changing attitude of young people. They now have an entirely different mindset from when I was young and attended similar events. They have more disposable income and are more mobile and adventurous. If control measures have to be included in legislation to cater for changing attitudes, it should be done and there should be no apologies for doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">I broadly support the Bill. Much of its emphasis is on premises but there should be more emphasis on organisers and promoters, and where their responsibilities rest. It is fine to implement regulations on structures and buildings but there should also be regulations governing promoters. It is often not clear who promotes or organises a concert. People know the venue and who is playing but may not know the organiser. Organisers also have responsibilities and they should be regulated in the same way as premises, and that should be included in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The Bill deals mainly with indoor venues for concerts and so on. I do not know where the line is drawn between an indoor and an outdoor venue. Is a venue deemed to be outdoor if it does not have a door? What of a sporting arena like Croke Park? Does its stand constitute a venue covered in the legislation? Are we dealing with indoor events only? How does the Bill relate to partly outdoor and partly indoor events? Will the Minister address those questions when he replies? From my experience and that of my constituents, crowd control at outdoor events is often  more lacking than that at indoor events. I would like to know how many of the 73 recommendations in the Hamilton report have been taken up in drawing up this Bill, although that report dealt with much more than indoor events.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Section 3 states that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this legislation shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. I do not understand that. It covers the administration of the Bill, but is responsibility for the measures contained in the Bill only that of the owner of the relevant premises, or does the responsibility also relate to those organising or promoting the event? If much work needs to be done to ensure the aims of the Bill are achieved, does that expense lie solely with the owners of the premises?</p>
          <p eId="para_370">There is a necessary but undesirable practice outlined in section 4. It states that the "Minister may, by regulations, provide for any matter referred to in this Act" and that "without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the Minister may, by regulation, prescribe any activity or class of activity that takes place wholly or mainly within a building, in respect of which members of the public may or may not attend, to be an event for the purposes of paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the definition of “indoor event” in section 2(1).”. This Bill will be passed by the Dáil and in time this or any future Minister may, by regulation, change the Bill without recourse to the Dáil. That may be a necessary practice but it is a risky one. This does not apply to this Bill alone. Where major regulations are to be introduced, those matters should have to come back before the Dáil or at least be considered by the relevant Dáil committee, in this case the Select Committee on Environment and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Section 6(1) states that a fire authority shall determine an application for a licence as soon as practicable but not later than 28 days after all requirements, including requirements prescribed under section 5(8), have been complied with or within such other period, as provided for in subsection (2). The Bill then states, at section 6(2), that the 28 day period can be extended where it is not possible or appropriate to determine the application within the period and shall specify the date before which or the period within which the fire authority intends the application shall be determined. That will present great difficulty if the regulation refers to all indoor events, as events sometimes have to be organised at shorter notice than 28 days. For example, if a general election was called – we must always be ready for such events in the present climate – a convention might have to be called at shorter notice.</p>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_373">As Deputies will be aware, the Government regrets the suspension of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland on 14 October last and the decision of the IRA to suspend contact with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning on 30 October. I reiterate, however, that the agreement itself has not been suspended. It remains the template for progress and both Governments remain wholeheartedly committed to its full implementation. They also share a determination, as expressed in the joint statement of the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair, to protect the many achievements of the Agreement and restore the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">The restoration of the institutions will only be possible if the required underlying trust and confidence among the parties can be rebuilt. This cannot be achieved by a process of incrementalism. Only irreversible acts of completion, by all sides, have the capacity to deliver the quantum leap that the process now requires. That necessitates a fast-forwarding of progress on the transition from paramilitarism to exclusively democratic means, as well as on the other key areas of confidence, including policing, security normalisation, institutional stability and the rights and equality agendas.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">In recent weeks, I have undertaken a round of intensive bilateral meetings with the pro-Agreement parties in Northern Ireland and the British Government. Together with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I participated in the meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference held at Hillsborough on 22 October. In addition, I met the new Secretary of State, Mr Paul Murphy, in Dublin on 6 November.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">This afternoon the Secretary of State and I issued invitations to the parties to participate in round-table talks in Belfast on 21 November. These talks will represent an important opportunity for all the parties to constructively and comprehensively address the range of outstanding issues on which progress is required, thereby renewing confidence in the political process.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The aim of all work taken forward in the immediate future will be to consolidate and protect the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement to date and to collectively implement its outstanding aspects. All parties have a role to play in overcoming the current deficit in confidence, restoring the devolved institutions in  Northern Ireland and delivering the full promise of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GayMitchell" eId="spk_257">
          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_378">Is the Minister aware that special branch numbers in Northern Ireland are down 50% on their pre-Patten size and that support units of the special branch have been merged within the wider police force? Is he aware that last week the policing board and the Chief Constable agreed to implement an independently drawn up radical new policy to end the force within a force? Is he aware that the new Chief Constable, Mr. Hugh Orde, has been responsible for an outside investigation of past security force collusion with loyalists, that the oversight commissioner, American Tom Constantine, has been vigorous in pursuing the full implementation of the Patten recommendations on the special branch? Does he agree that much of this has come about because of the Weston Park negotiations carried out by the SDLP?</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Will the Minister join me in expressing concern at the intimidation faced by Nationalists who wish to join the new police force? They have been joining in large numbers and the last recruitment round had 35% Catholic applications. This is significant given the high level of recruitment which at about 500 exceeds the Patten figure of 370. Does the Minister agree that Catholics from Northern Ireland, including those from republican neighbourhoods such as Newry and Derry, wish to join the new police force? Will he join me in supporting the SDLP call on those trying to intimidate Catholics to cease doing so? The best way to ensure that MI5 does not take over the activities of the special branch in Northern Ireland is to ensure that all parties join the police force and work with the SDLP and others to bring about the changes they have been successfully negotiating.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_258" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_380">Substantial progress has been made over the past year in bringing about the new beginning to policing promised by the Good Friday Agreement as set out in the Patten report. The new police service of Northern Ireland was established on 4 November 2001 and the first recruits selected on a 50:50 basis took up duty in April. The policing board came into being this time last year. Since then members of the board have worked unstintingly to ensure implementation of the new policing arrangements, crafting practical solutions to policing problems such as the design of the new police flag and emblem, the operation and response to the ombudsman's Omagh report and a new human resource strategy for the PSNI.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">In addition the board chose a new Chief Constable, Mr. Hugh Orde, who has made a positive impact since taking up duty in September, particularly in regard to tackling loyalist paramilitary violence. North-South policing co-operation has been enhanced with the signing on 29 April last of an intergovernmental agreement covering all areas of co-operation between the Garda Síoch ána and the PSNI as recommended in the Patten report. It includes reciprocal provisions for lateral entry and secondments with policing powers between the two police services. The necessary legislation to provide for such personnel changes is currently being prepared in each jurisdiction and should be in place early next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Last week, as the Deputy said, and I agree, the inspector of constabulary delivered a report to the policing board which reviewed the operation of the special branch and its relationship with other departments in the PSNI. The Chief Constable and the policing board will take his recommendations forward. Progress in this sensitive area will mark another vital step forward towards building a new future for policing in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The package of legislative amendments set out in the revised implementation plan of August 2001 is due to be announce in the British Parliament today, with the legislation being introduced in the House of Commons in mid-December. These amendments are designed to bring the Police (Northern Ireland) Act, 2000, into line with the Patten report in certain key areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Although much has been achieved on policing the Government realises that the new beginning will not be fully consolidated until such time as young people from Nationalist, republican and loyalist communities join the PSNI and the political representatives of the entire community take their places on the policing board. We are now looking to the forthcoming legislation and the longer-term debate about the devolution of policing and justice powers, also envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement and recommended by Patten, to provide a context in which such developments can and will take place. I agree with the Deputy there is no place for intimidation of those who wish to choose policing as a career.</p>

      the action he has taken to implement the recommendations of the task force on emigration policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [21669/02]

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_386">The task force on policy regarding emigrants was established last December on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness "to address the special needs of those Irish emigrants abroad who are particularly marginalised or at greatest risk of exclusion". The purpose of the task force was to develop a coherent, long-term approach to our emigrants and their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The task force presented its report to me at the end of August. The report has been published by my Department. I take this opportunity to express my thanks and appreciation to the Chairman, Mr. Paddy O'Hanlon, and the other members of the task force for the energy and  commitment they brought to their work. I was deeply saddened to learn of the recent death in New York of Monsignor James Murray who was a member of the task force and I offer his family and many friends my deep sympathies.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I welcome the report of the task force. It is a very comprehensive and forward looking document, which highlights the complex and varied issues affecting Irish people abroad. I share its view that we owe a great debt of gratitude to our emigrants and that we should acknowledge the enormous contributions they have made to the development of Ireland as well as the countries in which they settled.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The report makes clear that, while emigration has declined significantly in recent years, large numbers of people continue to leave this country every year, including those who emigrate involuntarily and without the necessary skills to cope with the challenges of living abroad. In addition, there are many people abroad, both Irish born and those of Irish descent, who wish to maintain and express their Irish identity and who look to their homeland for support in doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">At my request, the Government approved last month the establishment of an interdepartmental working group to examine the recommendations in the report with a view to preparing proposals for submission to the Government. The report contains many recommendations, some of which will require further consideration and development. The implementation of the report will be phased over a period of years. I hope that a start can be made in implementing the report, especially to help the most vulnerable and disadvantaged of our emigrants, both young and old.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I pay tribute to the voluntary agencies at home and abroad who provide assistance to emigrants and play an indispensable role in helping them, either before they leave or while they are abroad.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_260">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_392">I thank the Minister for establishing the long-awaited task force and congratulate it on a job well done. Does the Minister agree that emigrants need our help? Emigrants' remittances amounted to more than anything we ever received from the EU. They must be paid back because the money kept areas in the west going and kept communities together and we should not forget that.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Does the Minister agree that the fundamental part of the task force report is that necessary resources, such as finance, be put in place? It recommends an annual budget of €18 million to be allocated for this purpose in 2003 rising to €34 million in 2005. Is this not richly deserved and is it not the repayment of an honourable debt owed in justice and not in any sense of charity? These fine people supported us and England as well. Is the Minister prepared to give a commitment in the upcoming budget and confirm that the Estimates will provide for these magnificent people as per the task force report?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_261">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_394">As I have said to groups such as the Federation of Irish Societies whom I met last week, I gave free rein to the task force to come forward with whatever recommendations it wished. That was the understanding and agreement of its terms of reference. It was independent.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The interdepartmental committee will examine the report in the financial context in which the Government must operate. I have made it clear that this is a matter which must be dealt with in the financial context of all Government priorities. The task force examined the ideal situation and put forward the optimum position. It was entitled to do that and gave us an indication of the level to which we would have to go before we would be able to meet the type of service provision to which it believed emigrants are entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I see the task force as providing a new policy context for emigrants, not just in the short-term but also in the medium to long-term, breaking down the stereotypical attitudes of the 1950s and 1960s to emigrants and recognising the modern realities. We hope to make a start but I must be straight and honest with the Deputy and say that it would be remiss of me if I were to suggest to him that all the recommendations in every detail and certainly in terms of the amounts stated would be implemented next year. That will not be the case given the financial context in which the Government has to operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I said to the task force when it made its presentation to me that its work will serve the Government and its successors in that we will use the new policy context as a means of rearranging our priorities and making a start on the comprehensive recommendations. There are many of them and emigrant communities throughout the world are included in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The interdepartmental working group will consider the report and I established that body immediately. We must see what we can do to improve the co-ordination of the service so those with inadequate skills who are about to emigrate are given the opportunity through State agencies to prepare so they do not emigrate unprepared as people did in their droves for many generations. Many coped well but we know others did not. The Deputy has direct experience in this area and I commend him on the work he has done in his Mulranny project. I do not question his commitment and good faith in raising these issues. However, it would be remiss of me not to point out to him that full resourcing for the report from day one is not something which will be available to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">We must first use the interdepartmental working group to see what recommendations we can deal with in the short-term and over time build a policy framework that will seek to address these issues in consultation with and the agreement of the many people at home and abroad who work in this area on a voluntary basis.</p>

      <b>Mr. M. Higgins</b>
      asked the

      if the authority of the Security Council of the United Nations regarding all judgments on compliance with the Charter of the United Nations and its resolutions will be vindicated in all matters relating to the current situation in Iraq; if the Government's position is one of support for the United Nations, opposition to unilateral military action or pre-emptive strikes, and that Irish facilities, including Shannon Airport, will cease to be used for preliminary military purposes in the current or a future situation.
      [21671/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_262">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_401">On Friday, 8 November the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1441 on the situation in Iraq. The Government supported this resolution which we believe offers the most likely means of achieving the three goals we set ourselves, namely, to obtain Iraq's voluntary compliance with its disarmament obligations, to avoid a military conflict and to preserve the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. The resolution represents the outcome of nearly two months of painstaking negotiations in the council in which Ireland played an active part.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The resolution provides for a clear sequential process whereby the inspectors will report back to the council on Iraq's compliance with its obligations under Security Council resolutions. It has decided that Iraq is already in material breach of its obligations, but notwithstanding this, has afforded Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations. Accordingly, further acts of non-compliance by Iraq will be reported immediately to the Security Council by the arms inspectors. Such reports will then be assessed by the Security Council which will consider the position to decide on any further steps to be taken to bring about full compliance. This was a principal objective of Ireland and other like-minded countries. The agreed text of this resolution contrasts sharply with the original draft which provided that any failure by Iraq to comply would automatically authorise member states to use force.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Ireland is a strong supporter of the United Nations and a strong advocate of the system of collective international security based on the UN Charter. Under the terms of the charter, the UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Ireland believes that the integrity of the UN Charter and the prerogatives of the Security Council are fully preserved in the terms of Resolution 1441. For Ireland this is an issue of the most fundamental importance. The Government is pleased that this resolution has brought the issue back to the Security Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">We have not yet reached the point where military force is inevitable. Nevertheless, it appears that only the convincing threat of what the Security Council has described as serious consequences  will persuade the Iraqi regime to cease its ongoing violation of its disarmament responsibilities. This is a cause of deep regret. The Government's clear preference is to see this matter resolved without recourse to the use of force. We will continue to work within the Security Council to this end. However, primary responsibility for ensuring a peaceful outcome rests with the Iraqi authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The Government will continue to review the granting of overflight and landing facilities in the light of developments. There is no intention at this point to revise the current arrangements.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_263">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_406">The Minister said the Government will continue to review the overflight arrangements at Shannon in the context of current events. The most recently offered justification for the use of Shannon was Resolution 1368 and the international movement against terrorism. As no connection has been established between that movement and the preparations for a strike against Iraq inside or outside Security Council authorisation, why are the arrangements continuing?</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Will the Minister tell the House that a pre-emptive strike outside further review by the Security Council would be illegal under international law? Regarding the text to which he refers, namely the Chapter VII resolution that takes the decision, he will be aware that Condoleeza Rice and others have suggested that this allows the United States to interpret what a breach is and to suggest that even a delay in implementation would constitute a major breach. The Minister will be aware that in paragraph 4 of the decision, breach is defined. However, in later parts of it – perhaps that was the merit of the resolution – it allowed anybody to offer any interpretation they wanted. I would be interested in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">There is another point on which I would like the Minister to be positive. Should compliance be on offer from the Iraqi side, what commitment is there to a review of the sanctions regime, which was at the centre of the previous resolutions, to which the resolution makes reference?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_409">I will deal with the question relating to material breach first. The understanding of the concept of material breach is in accordance with the definition contained in the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. This defines material breach as: "The violation of a provision essential to the accomplishment of the object or purpose of the treaty". Minor errors or omissions would not appear to come within this definition. We expect this definition to be applied in determining whether any further material breach has occurred, should it be necessary to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">In the event of any suggestion of material breach under operative paragraph 4, there is a requirement that operative paragraphs 11 and 12 come into operation. In other words, it will still  require a report from the inspectors to be brought to the Security Council in making an assessment of a material breach suggested by anyone on the council or any member state. The idea that – as I saw in some commentaries – in the immediate aftermath of the resolution any one state or a number of states could decide on a material breach having occurred thereby providing a trigger mechanism for military force, is not a correct reading of the resolution. The resolution requires that once a material breach is suggested under operative paragraph 4, operative paragraphs 11 and 12 come into play. That requires not just that the suggestion of material breach by a member state, for example, would come back for consideration by the Security Council, but also that in order to have that discussion, there is a requirement for the inspectors to make an assessment on that suggestion of a material breach.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Regarding the question of pre-emptive strikes and their legal validity, the Deputy will be aware there is not an international legal consensus on this. Some states suggest that a mandate for military action exists based on existing resolutions, which have already been passed. If there were any move towards military force, everyone would be best advised to come back to the Security Council for consideration and for the approval of the Security Council in order that it would have the widest possible support and legitimacy in international law. Clearly a resolution such as this, which has brought about an outcome of a 15 to nil vote, involves compromises by everybody in order to reach agreement. Our interpretation of the resolution is that we should come back to the Security Council for such authorisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">On the question of foreign military aircraft landing at Shannon, that is being done in compliance with the normal orders, the detail of which I have given in innumerable answers to parliamentary questions. We have received no request for the use of military aircraft in the context of Iraq. All usage of Shannon is in respect of the resolutions that have been cited already.</p>

      <b>Mr. G. Mitchell</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      if he will report on the issues facing Ireland as a result of membership of the UN Security Council.
      [21765/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_416">The issues facing Ireland throughout the two years of our Security Council membership have been challenging and multifaceted. As I have previously told the House, our approach to issues on the council agenda has been based on our traditional commitment to  peacekeeping, disarmament, human rights and development co-operation. We have sought to ensure that the human rights of individuals and the humanitarian needs of populations remain central to discussions at the council and have stressed at all times the need to address the root causes of conflict and to respect the principles of international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">We have sought to take each issue on its merits and work constructively with members of the council and other interested parties to find a solution which is in the broadest possible interest of the international community. Our permanent representative and his staff have made a special effort to stay in close contact with the wider membership of the UN, who were responsible for electing us to the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">This approach has, in my view, stood us in good stead. It has enabled Ireland to make a very positive and substantive contribution to the work of the council and has brought a fresh perspective and an objective approach to its work which has been welcomed and respected by other member states, in and beyond the council, and by the NGO community.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Two substantial resolutions on Iraq have been adopted by the council in 2002 with active Irish engagement. Resolution 1441, adopted on 8 November, gives Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations through compliance with a reinforced inspections regime. In so doing, it offers the best possible means of avoiding a recourse to military action and preserving the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. Resolution 1409, adopted on 14 May, made changes to the system of economic sanctions against Iraq designed to reduce their impact on the civilian population. This was a major goal for Ireland on the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">During Ireland's time on the council, 12 resolutions have been passed on the situation in the Middle East, most recently Resolution 1435, which condemned terrorist attacks and expressed support for the work of the quartet. The council is working towards a two state solution and is actively supporting the work of the quartet on a road map leading to a Palestinian state within three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Ireland has played its part fully in the serious work in the international fight against terrorism that has been undertaken following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. We have been active in discussions on the reconstruction of Afghanistan where we were successful in seeking to focus the council's attention on the humanitarian situation of the Afghan people.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">African issues have been a consistent priority for the Security Council during Ireland's period of membership. Significant progress has been made towards resolving the conflicts in the DRC, Angola, Sierra Leone and Ethiopia-Eritrea, and the challenge now is to consolidate that progress and avoid a slide back into war. Important issues which need to be tackled include the dire humani tarian situation in many conflict countries, grave abuses of human rights, the use of child soldiers, and ongoing insecurity, often as a result of the uncontrolled flow of small arms and light weapons across borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The illegal trade in conflict commodities, such as diamonds, is an issue which has been tackled by the Security Council in Sierra Leone, Angola and the DRC, and must be kept under constant review to ensure that conflicts do not become self-financing and self-perpetuating. As chair of the Angola sanctions committee, Ireland made a significant contribution to bringing to an end the military action by UNITA which has caused so much suffering to the people of Angola.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Ireland took a particularly firm position on the situation in Western Sahara, where we have refused to support proposals which could have called into question the right of the Saharwi people to self-determination.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Membership of the council has also afforded us the opportunity to work to improve UN sanctions regimes. While there is no doubt that specifically targeted sanctions play an important role where flagrant breaches of international law occur or there is a threat to international peace, there is a strong balancing objective to ensure that the civilian population of the country against whose government the sanctions are imposed does not suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">In the remaining weeks of our term, we will continue to promote Ireland's values and objectives in the pursuit of international peace and security and human rights for all.</p>

          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_427">What independent assessment has the Minister or his Department carried out of the United States' expressions of concerns about Iraq and of the Blair dossier on Iraq? Will he make such independent assessment available to the House? Will the Minister put the Government's proposed response to any further resolution on Iraq to this House for ratification before our ambassador to the UN is instructed regarding any declaration of war or punitive action against Iraq? I was recently struck by something President Bush said. He said he knew the views of Congress. Does the Minister know the views of the Dáil? Before Ireland participates in any further vote regarding resolutions on Iraq, will the Minister ensure he comes before the House to explain to us the reasoning behind his proposed action and to seek the consent of the House for such action?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_269">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_428">In relation to the evidence we have regarding Iraq's access to weapons of mass destruction, a number of assessments, including evidence gathered by previous work carried out by arms inspectors in Iraq, are available. The assessments we have seen, such as that in the British independent report of the Institute of Strategic Studies, paint a disturbing picture. Although they do not present conclusive proof that the threat is immediate and pressing, they re- inforce concerns we already have. It will not be until the arms inspectors return to Iraq that a reliably accurate and independent assessment can be carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Regarding the second matter the Deputy raises, the purpose of Resolution 1441 is to bring about Iraqi co-operation with arms inspections, not to mandate military action. The resolution lays down the procedures which require the question of Iraqi non-compliance to be considered at a further meeting of the Security Council. It would then be up to the Security Council to assess whether Iraq had failed to meet its obligations and to decide on action which might be required. This decision might include authorising the use of force by member states. If any such resolution was passed it would then be up to the Government to decide what action should be taken by Ireland in the light of our relevant constitutional provisions. The Deputy can be assured that the Government will, at all times, abide fully by the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Those circumstances do not arise now and the Government is acting under Article 29.4 of the Constitution which provides that the executive power of the State, in connection with its external relations, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government. The clear legal opinion is that, in discharging that executive function in international fora like the UN Security Council – if it were decided circumstances demanded it and the Secretary General felt we had to discharge our responsibilities – a resolution was passed mandating military or other action, that does not amount to a declaration of war by Ireland. This does not relate to Iraq specifically, it is a general principle. It is simply the Security Council using its powers under Article 42 to seek to enforce its resolutions through military action if it so decides. If the Deputy is suggesting that constitutes participation in a war—</p>

The United States takes into account the views of the US Congress. Does the Minister know the views of this House and will he seek to find out what they are before he advises the Government how to exercise its role?</p>

          <p eId="para_432">Of course I will. Any time a debate on this or any other issue is required or sought, it can be afforded. That is the way the Parliament operates. However, an important clarifying point is that the Executive plays a role in the Constitution in relation to the exercise of our foreign policy. The Parliament may use its authority for the purpose of having a debate to hold the Government to account and discuss issues but the suggestion of a requirement of prior approval in relation to the passing of such a Security Council resolution does not have a legal basis. The political requirements and views of the Parliament are  of course issues to which I would listen and I have no problem with a debate in that context.</p>

      <b>Mr. M. Higgins</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      the procedures used for evaluating the recent list of organisations and individuals adopted by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the European Union as constituting a threat of terrorism; the origin of such a list; the reason, in particular, for the inclusion of a peace negotiator in the conflict in the Philippines (details supplied); and his views on the significance and implications of such a list now constituting a common position within the European Union.
      [21672/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_434">On 28 September 2001, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1373. Resolution 1373 imposes obligations on member states under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and is a comprehensive and specific statement of the international community's determination to deny terrorists the tools of their trade – finance, arms and shelter. The resolution obliges member states, <i>inter alia,</i> to criminalise the provision or collection of funds which are to be used to carry out terrorist acts; freeze funds of persons who commit, or attempt to commit, terrorist acts or participate in or facilitate the commission of terrorist acts; prohibit their nationals or any persons and entities within their territories from making funds available for the benefit of persons who commit or attempt to commit or facilitate or participate in the commission of terrorist acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">In view of the binding nature of the resolution and to underline the EU's commitment to preventing the financing of terrorism, it was considered important to give effect to the Security Council resolution at EU level. To this end, the EU adopted three legal instruments in December 2001: a common position (No. 930/2001) ‘on combating terrorism', essentially transposing UNSCR 1373; a common position (No. 931/2001) ‘on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism'; and a Council regulation (No. 2580/2001) on ‘specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities'. Council regulations have direct effect in all EU member states. The latter two instruments provide for the drawing up of lists of persons and entities involved in terrorist acts who shall be subject to the widest possible police and judicial co-operation and freezing of assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Proposals of names for the lists may be made by any EU member state or third country. Evidence of involvement in a terrorist act, as defined in the common position, must be provided by the proposing state and, in the case of material received from a non-EU country, the Council has committed itself to apply additional safeguards to ensure that the proposal complies with the fundamental principles and procedures of the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Article 1(4) of common position 931/2001 sets out the criteria for listing of a person, group or entity. The proposing country must provide precise information that a decision has been taken, by a competent authority in that state, to instigate investigations or prosecution for a terrorist act or an attempt to perpetrate, participate in or facilitate such an act based on serious and credible evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">On the basis of a detailed and in-depth examination of all the information made available by the proposing member state and-or third country, and having satisfied itself that the information meets the criteria set out in Article 1(4), the Council updates the lists. Regular reviews of existing names take place at least once every six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">These lists are a valuable instrument in the fight against terrorism. They are drawn up with great care. Any persons who may feel that they have been unjustly included on the lists are free to challenge their inclusion in the EU courts. The Council regulation also explicitly provides for exemptions to the freezing of assets to satisfy essential human needs of a listed person and his or her family, including in particular payments for foodstuffs, medicines and medical treatment, rent or mortgage payments and payment to public utilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_440">Unusually for the Minister, he has not answered the question. To be explicit, one of the chief negotiators on behalf of the New People's Army in the Philippines, Mr. José Maria Sison, in talks with the Filipino Government towards achieving peace, has been placed on this list. On the basis of what evidence and review of evidence was this done before the Minister lent his name to it? I know all the instruments which followed Resolution 1373 – we all do – and it is always useful to hear them again but not <i>in extenso.</i> Is it the case that the Government accepted the list that was supplied by the United States? Was a suggestion made to the Minister by the Dutch Government that the name should be included? Does the Minister not see the stupidity of including the name of a chief peace negotiator in the Filipino conflict on a list like this, which leaves him open to being extradited from Holland and being sent back to where he is totally unsafe and unable to participate in the peace process? What kind of knee-jerk reaction is that? Who supplied the list? Was it the United States? Did the Irish Government examine why this man's name should be on it? On whose suggestion was his name included? I know about the rest – I keep up to date.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">I apologise to the Deputy for the technical introduction. The specific bones of the reply, which I was reaching, should have been earlier in the reply in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">As regards the individual specifically referred to by the Deputy, the Council decided on 28 October 2002 to add José Maria Sison, also  known as Armando Liwanag, also known as Joma, to the list. This followed similar action by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the Netherlands. Mr. Sison founded and heads the Communist Party of the Philippines, a Maoist group formed in 1968. Violent attacks are conducted by its military wing, the New People's Army, which was also added to the EU lists. The common aim of these two entities is to overthrow the Philippine Government. The New People's Army has openly threatened to attack US civilian and military personnel in the Philippines and has claimed responsibility for the assassination of two Philippine congressmen in June 2001. Under his alias, Armando Liwinag, Mr. Sison instructed the New People's Army to "inflict severe casualties" on US soldiers in the Philippines in an order published in April 2002 in the newsletter of the Communist Party of the Philippines.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Mr. Sison is also the self-styled chief political consultant of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, NDFP, which has an international office in the Netherlands, where Mr. Sison is currently based. The NDFP has been engaged in intermittent peace negotiations with the Philippines Government on behalf of the Communist Party of the Philippines. Before the decision to list Mr. Sison and the New People's Army, negotiations had broken down and hostilities resumed. However, it is understood that the Philippine Government does not regard the listing as precluding possible future negotiations with Mr. Sison.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">At least we have clarified the fact that the United States provided the name and that is how it appeared on the list. Does the Minister agree it is singularly unhelpful to the peace process in the Philippines that the chief negotiator on behalf of the NPA is probably not free to return to the Philippines or to participate in negotiations in Holland? Did the Dutch Government take some initiative in relation to the US list? I believe the list includes 38 organisations and about a dozen individuals. This country has a relationship with the Filipino peace process and there is a large number of Filipino citizens in the European Union. Why would somebody who is so important to the peace negotiations be put on such a list?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_452">In his report to the UN millennium summit in September 2000, the UN Secretary General said that HIV-AIDS threatened to reverse a generation of accomplishments in human development and is rapidly becoming a social crisis on a global scale. One of the development goals adopted by the summit was that, by 2015, the international community should have halted, and begun to reverse, the spread of HIV-AIDS. In July 2002, the joint United Nations Programme on HIV-AIDS, UNAIDS, and the World Health Organisation, WHO, reported that 40 million people were living with the HIV virus or had developed full blown AIDS. In 2001, more than five million people were newly infected and more than three million had died of the disease. While the incidence of the disease is growing rapidly in the Caribbean, Asia and eastern Europe, by far the worst affected region is the African continent. UNAIDS estimates that 25 million people, or over 70% of the global total of people infected with HIV, are living in Africa. The percentage of the adult population living with HIV is estimated to be over 35% in Botswana and over 25% in Zimbabwe. In these circumstances, a child who is now 15 years old has a 50% risk of dying of AIDS in his or her lifetime.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">As the spread of HIV-AIDS is a global threat, it requires a global response. The United Nations is leading the international fight against HIV-AIDS, an issue which Kofi Annan has made one of his personal priorities. The role of the UN in the fight against HIV-AIDS was cited by the  Nobel Peace Prize Committee when it awarded the prize to the Secretary General and the UN in 2001. The UN Security Council has held three open debates on the threat to international peace and security posed by HIV-AIDS. The council debate in January 2000 was the first time the council addressed a health issue. The decision by the Security Council to debate HIV-AIDS helped push the issue high up the international agenda and accelerate the international response.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">In June 2001, the UN General Assembly held a special session on HIV-AIDS which the Taoiseach attended on behalf of the Government. The special session adopted a comprehensive declaration of commitments on HIV-AIDS which provides the international framework for the fight against the disease. The declaration, <i>inter alia,</i> endorsed the establishment of a global fund to help finance the efforts of Governments in dealing with HIV-AIDS. The global fund to fight HIV-AIDS, Malaria and TB was established in January 2002. While not formally part of the UN system, the board of the fund includes the executive directors of the World Health Organisation and UNAIDS.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"><i>Additional information</i>To date, the fund has received $2.6 billion from Governments and is now responding to the requests submitted to it from developing countries for assistance in their efforts to deal with the disease. In 2002, Ireland contributed €10 million to the fund. The fight against HIV-AIDS has been integrated into all the activities of key UN development agencies such as the UN development programme, UNICEF, the UN population fund and the World Health Organisation. UNAIDS has played a central role in securing international recognition of the threat posed by HIV-AIDS and co-ordinating the response of the numerous UN agencies involved. In 2002, Ireland Aid contributed €2.9 million to UNAIDS. In 2003 Ireland will, for the first time, become a member of the programme co-ordinating board of UNAIDS which oversees all the activities of the organisation. A key element of Ireland's strategy has been to mainstream AIDS across all development activities supported. I recently met the administrator of the UNDP and emphasised the need for a stronger response to AIDS across all UN programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">While the UN continues to lead the international response to the HIV-AIDS epidemic, particularly in Africa, the UN Secretary General has pointed out that the key to success is the political commitment of the Governments of the most affected countries. In countries such as Thailand, Senegal and Uganda where the Governments have recognised the threat and worked to implement national plans to fight the disease, the rates of infection are declining.</p>

          <p eId="para_457">What proportion of the commitment pledged has been delivered? I ask the Minister of State to address the situation in an  African country, such as Uganda, which is one of the worst affected areas. The price of a bag of coffee there is now only 34% of what it was five years ago. The international trade regime has undermined the capacity of African people to respond to the AIDS crisis. Aid has decreased and, as I understand it, a very small proportion of the specific commitments made to the global fund have been met.</p>

          <p eId="para_460">I agree with the Deputy. It is a reflection of the fact that many countries fail to honour their commitments. I raised this issue with the UN Secretary General and we will continue to pursue it at every opportunity. The Deputy's point in relation to coffee prices is really a separate question. However, that issue is on the agenda for a meeting of the General Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and I will attend next week.</p>

          <p eId="para_462">As I said in reply to Deputy Higgins, the EU Development Council has been integrated with the General Affairs Council. While one could argue for and against that, my view is that the new arrangement gives added strength to the voice of Ireland on this issue. The Taoiseach has taken a special interest in this matter and raised it at the special session of the UN in 2001. As part of my responsibility for overseas development and human rights, I have made it a priority for my Department. This year, €50 million will be spent on the treatment of people affected by HIV-AIDS and the care of orphans. On my visit to Malawi and Zambia shortly after my appointment as Minister of State, I saw the work being done by Irish Aid and NGOs in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">With regard to pharmaceuticals, I was previously involved in this issue at WTO level as  Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment when EU Trade Ministers introduced the TRIPS Agreement which has allowed for cheaper generic medicines to be made available in the developing world. This policy is an important achievement of the European Union. The executive director of the global fund, Professor Richard Beecham, visited this country recently and is very supportive in this regard. The Clinton Foundation is also keen to work with Ireland, the UK and Sweden in dealing with the treatment aspect. Our objective is to link in with like-minded people who are working to eradicate this pandemic in Africa.</p>

The UN population fund does extremely important work in women's health care and, as the Deputy outlined, the prevention of the spread of HIV and AIDS. The Government's position is clear.

      <b>Mr. Noonan</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      the priorities he has set for Ireland's membership of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which commences on 1 January 2003; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [21553/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_467">Ireland is firmly committed to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, which include promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction. Human rights concerns play a central role in our foreign policy. In this context, we attach great importance to the Commission on Human Rights, which is the primary forum within the United Nations for the discussion of human rights matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Ireland has previously served three terms on the Commission on Human Rights, and will again be a member from 1 January 2003 for a three-year period. I am looking forward to the challenges and responsibilities which membership of the commission will bring. These will assume added importance during our EU Presidency in the first half of 2004 when we will speak and negotiate on behalf of the European Union at the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">The European Union is a major participant in the work of the Commission on Human Rights  and partners work together to identify priorities, make common statements, put forward resolutions jointly and adopt common positions on proposals. Ireland will continue to participate fully with our partners in these actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Ireland considers that a major role of the commission should be to ensure that human rights standards are universally accepted and implemented and that the international community reacts appropriately where human rights are violated or abused. We are concerned at a recent tendency for political considerations, rather than human rights concerns, to dictate the commission's approach to a number of questions, in particular to country situations. We will continue to work actively with our European Union partners to ensure the Commission addresses in an impartial and effective way the many important items on its agenda, including the various thematic issues and country situations which come before it.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">When it considers it necessary, the commission mandates special rapporteurs to investigate and report to it on individual countries or on specific issues. We will seek to ensure that these representatives of the commission are given the support they need to carry out their mandate fully and effectively and in particular that they receive the necessary co-operation from states.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Ireland is a major contributor to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. During our term on the commission, one of our main aims will be to strengthen and support the Office so that the High Commissioner will be able to carry out fully the mandate entrusted to him by the General Assembly in 1993.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">I was particularly disappointed that the commission failed to reach agreement on the follow-up mechanisms to the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Other Forms of Intolerance, which took place in Durban last year. Ireland will work towards the restoration of the consensus on this important question so that the international community can act in a concerted and cohesive manner to overcome racism and intolerance wherever they occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"><i>Additional information</i>The General Assembly is expected shortly to adopt an optional protocol to the Convention Against Torture which will greatly strengthen the convention by providing it with a mechanism for carrying out inspection visits. Ireland strongly supports the optional protocol and will work with other like-minded countries so that it can enter into force at the earliest opportunity. We will also lend support to the work of the special rapporteurs on torture, on arbitrary detention and on summary executions.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Ireland has traditionally presented resolutions on two issues to the Commission on Human Rights, and we will work to build further support for these. The resolution on the elimination of  religious intolerance seeks to ensure that all states provide effective guarantees for freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, including effective remedies where that right is violated. It also provides the mandate to the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and Belief to examine incidents and governmental actions in all parts of the world that are incompatible with the provisions of the declaration on the elimination of religious intolerance, and to recommend remedial measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The resolution on the rights of persons with disabilities, for which we are the lead sponsor, deals with the question of discrimination and promotes the full participation of persons with disabilities in activities at both national and international level, including in human rights related bodies. I look forward to Ireland playing an active and constructive role in the commission with the aim of ensuring that human rights are effectively promoted and protected at the international level.</p>

          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_477">In relation to the Minister's priorities and the possibility of departmental rapporteurs, will Ireland raise the human rights abuses in Israel and Palestine as a priority? These include the excessive activities of the Israelis, the malnutrition of Palestinian children, and the suicide bombers, all of which amount to an atrocity. Will the Minister look at the whole question of human rights in Israel and Palestine with a view to bringing it to the top of the agenda?</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I also ask the Minister whether, now that the Taliban have been replaced in Afghanistan, the human rights situation there continues to be monitored. There are worrying reports about prisoners of war, or prisoners taken subsequently, allegedly being lined up and shot. These are third hand reports and I do not know if they are accurate. Will the Minster ensure that human rights in Afghanistan continue to be monitored?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_479">I will take the Deputy's concerns into consideration as we take up membership of the commission. We have traditionally presented resolutions on two issues to the commission and worked for further support for them. The resolution on the elimination of religious intolerance seeks to ensure that all states provide effective guarantees for freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, including affective remedies where that right is violated. It also provides the mandate for a special rapporteur on the freedom of religion and belief to examine incidents and governmental actions in all parts of the world which are incompatible with the provisions of the declaration on the provision and to recommend remedial measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The resolution on the rights of persons with disabilities, for which we are the lead sponsor, deals with the question of discrimination and promotes the full participation of persons with disabilities in activities at both national and international levels, including human rights related  bodies. There were 90 resolutions passed on a wide range of issues in the last plenary session. We will take up our positions in consultation with EU partners and others. The two particular matters which the Deputy raised concerned areas of conflict where there have been and continue to be human rights abuses on all sides.</p>

Our position is that regardless of their status they should be afforded basic dignities.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_484">The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which has jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the most horrific of crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, entered into force on 1 July 2002. The statute currently has 82 states parties, including all European Union member states. Ireland ratified the statute on 11 April 2002 following the decision of the people in June 2001 to amend the Constitution to allow for such ratification. Following its entry into force, the first session of the Assembly of States Parties to the Statute was convened in New York from 3 to 10 September to put in place arrangements necessary to ensure the effective functioning of the court. The assembly adopted a number of resolutions, <i>inter alia</i> adopting the rules of procedure and evidence of the court, the elements of crimes which provide an interpretative guide to the crimes set out in the statute, a relationship agreement between the court and the United Nations and the financial rules and regulations of the court.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The assembly also adopted two resolutions on procedures for the nomination and election of judges, the prosecutor and deputy prosecutor of the court. The closing date for nominations for election of judges and the prosecutor is 30 November and the elections are scheduled to take place at the resumed first session of the Assembly of States Parties, to be convened in New York from 3 to 7 February 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Currently 22 candidates have formally been nominated as judges, while no candidate has yet been nominated for the position of prosecutor. Ireland has nominated Judge Maureen Harding  Clark for election to the court. Judge Clark, who is one of Ireland's leading criminal lawyers, is currently serving as a judge on the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, having been elected to that position by the General Assembly of the United Nations in June 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">On the date of the entry into force of the statute an advance team was sent to The Hague, where the court will be situated, to make practical arrangements to ensure the smooth functioning of the court. On 14 October 2002, the director of the division of common services appointed by the Assembly of States Parties took his office at the seat of the court and the advance team completed its functions at the end of October. Pending the election of the registrar of the court in April 2003, the director will perform the functions of the registrar and he is currently recruiting staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Once the judges and senior officials of the court have been elected in the first half of 2003 and the necessary staff recruited, the court will become fully operational. Ireland will continue its strong support for the court in this implementation phase and beyond and I look forward to an effective and efficient court.</p>

          <p eId="para_489">I thank the Minister for his reply and ask if he is aware that Amnesty International claims that the United States is pressing states around the world to enter into impunity agreements not to surrender US nationals to the International Criminal Court. They say that in many cases the US Government is threatening to withdraw military assistance from countries which will not agree. Amnesty International claims that such agreements are unlawful under international law and that they threaten to undermine international efforts to stop criminals from ever again planning the worst crimes known to humanity. Given that the Minister is aware of such claims, will he tell the House what assessment he has made of them? Is the Government concerned about these claims? What steps are being taken to address this issue?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_490">The EU common position has been to deal with the principle of impunity. There have been discussions between the EU and the United States about the matter and the EU has tried to accommodate the concerns of the US in a manner which is consistent with the statute. The Government believes that the US concerns can be satisfied under the Rome Statute and by means of other international instruments. We will continue to work with the United States and other UN member states to allay concerns and to ensure the effective functioning of the court without delay. The US position on this matter has not met with the agreement of other countries and the European Union. However, discussions have taken place to try to ensure that we make clear that we do not agree with the idea of people being able to avoid coming before the court in the complementary jurisdiction that it provides.  We want to make sure that all nations live up to the statute.</p>

Does he agree that that was quite appalling? Is it not a fact that the EU Council of Foreign Ministers changed its position? Although the Ministers initially defended the Rome Statute, when they came under pressure they changed their position by reaching an agreement with the United States that left individual countries free to reach an accommodation.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">I will try to answer all questions, although a number of different issues were raised. The Common Position is that the Union wants to see the matter resolved in a way that does not cede the principle of impunity. We are trying to achieve that precise objective. We have asked legal experts to use their expertise to provide for  such an outcome. It is not true to say that the Foreign Ministers have ceded the principle, as we certainly have not and will not do so. We are seeking to accommodate the situation in a manner that is consistent with the court and a fair degree of legal expertise will be required to see if that is possible. We are prepared to work in every way we can, but not on the basis of ceding the principle. It is incorrect to suggest that we have ceded the principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The EU Foreign Affairs Ministers, through the Danish Presidency, have made clear their position regarding the principle and it is unfair to suggest otherwise. Many of the concerns of the United States do not require bilateral agreements. We have asked the European Union's legal experts to deal with the situation in a consistent manner and we have asked all member states not to sign any bilateral agreements until we can get a Common Position, as outlined by the Danish Presidency. I think we have adopted a fair and open position.</p>

      the role the EU has taken regarding India and Pakistan and conflicts between these states.

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_506">Tensions in the regions referred to in the question have eased since my last statement on this issue in June. Deputies will be aware that India and Pakistan seemed to be on the brink of war in January and again in May and June of this year. While the situation remains serious, there have been positive developments recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The Seville Council issued a strong message of concern in June, calling on Pakistan to take further concrete action, in accordance with assurances it had given, to stop infiltration across the line of control and to prevent terrorist groups from operating from territory under its control. The Council encouraged India to be ready to respond with further de-escalatory steps if Pakistan took the necessary actions. The importance of free, fair and inclusive elections in Jammu and Kashmir this year was noted. The Council called on India and Pakistan to implement confidence building measures to defuse the immediate crisis and encouraged both countries to achieve a lasting settlement through bilateral dialogue. The EU high representative, Mr. Solana, visited Delhi and Islamabad in late July and an EU heads of mission troika to Jammu and Kashmir followed between 6 and 10 August. The EU has offered at every opportunity to assist both countries in finding a way out of the present stalemate. The EU  Presidency welcomed the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir in October and called on India and Pakistan to resume diplomatic dialogue as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">In recent months, Ireland has made its concerns known at every opportunity to representatives of India and Pakistan in Dublin, New York, New Delhi and Islamabad. Our ambassador to Pakistan presented his credentials in Islamabad to President Musharraf and the former Foreign Minister, Mr. Sattar, in June, and took that opportunity to outline our views. I met the new Foreign Minister, Mr. Ul-Haq, at the United Nations in September and reiterated our hope that Pakistan will accede to the non-proliferation treaty. I also urged increased co-operation on terrorism issues and support for bilateral dialogue.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Following the recent elections in Jammu and Kashmir and the encouraging subsequent withdrawal of Indian and Pakistani troops from the line of control, there is a growing hope that talks may resume. The new government of Jammu and Kashmir, a coalition of the two largest parties in the assembly, the Congress Party and the People's Democratic Party, was sworn in on 2 November. The proposed visit of the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Vajpayee, to Pakistan next January to attend a meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation is being seen as an encouraging development. The composition of the Government in Pakistan after last month's elections is unclear. Ireland, along with its EU partners, remains fully committed to supporting the next stages towards this critical dialogue.</p>

          <p eId="para_513">This is a matter of ongoing concern. The missile testing that took place in January of this year was regarded by Ireland as being contrary to Security Council Resolution 1172. Our support for the aims and objectives of the non-proliferation treaty has been continually expressed in the actions of the New Agenda coalition. New Agenda submitted a working paper after the first preparatory meeting for the 2005  review cycle of the treaty. The working paper, which was the basis for a resolution in the UN General Assembly First Committee in October 2002, highlighted the need to implement the steps towards nuclear disarmament, agreed by consensus at the non-proliferation treaty review conference in 2000. The Government continues to call on India and Pakistan to accede without delay to the non-proliferation treaty, as non-nuclear weapons states. The situation in south Asia underlines the importance of the early entry into force of the comprehensive test ban treaty. We have maintained a consistent view during all the multilateral discussions on disarmament.</p>

          <p eId="para_515">We have always believed in the primacy of the UN as regards the resolution of international disputes. The Indian Government regards the Kashmir dispute as an internal matter, however. The dialogue we have engaged in has been geared towards reaching a situation where the Security Council might be allowed to discuss the situation, let alone start to resolve it. This difficult and seemingly intractable problem can be traced back to foundation of the states of India and Pakistan. Given the fact that high tensions are involved and that both countries possess nuclear weapons, it is important that we continue to try to encourage bilateral and multilateral dialogue. The events of the last 12 months demonstrate that this is an issue of international concern and not one that can be simply handled as an internal problem for India.</p>

Clearly we have a consistent view of successive Governments. We got what we thought was a major advance at the review of the non-proliferation treaty when some impetus was put back into the disarmament debate. People are already resiling from these commitments. It is a matter of regret to us that that has happened. We are continuing, using whatever means we have available through the new agenda coalition, to push for non-proliferation and for countries to meet their responsibilities in the event of a successful disarmament process in Iraq. I am open to consider ing circumstances whereby disarmament can be availed of in other countries which are a threat to international peace and security.</p>

It cannot be disputed that courageous steps were taken. What one would like to see is a commitment by that military Government to democratic elections in Pakistan. In the meantime, we must deal with those who are in authority in Pakistan. While I do not agree with its form of Government, I give credit to those who showed courage at a time when the international community needed it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_529">I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words about this important Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">While the horrific tragedy at Hillsborough in 1998 happened outdoors, it has been etched ever since in the memory of everyone who saw it. Suddenly controlling where people meet for recreational purposes has become a huge source of worry for people, including all the authorities. This Bill provides for the licensing of indoor events and, as such, we should consider the main provisions of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Many speakers referred to the fact that because there is a greater amount of leisure time and a greater amount of money available, particularly to young people, naturally a greater number of indoor and outdoor events are being organised for a variety of reasons. It is worth mentioning that the Bill is all-embracing and does not just  relate to young people. We normally tend to think there is greater danger and uncontrolled organisation where young people congregate. We must, however, ensure there are greater safety standards for the elderly because they would have particular problems should anything happen at an organised indoor event. We must legislate in every way possible to minimise risk at events.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I have spent many years, as have many other Deputies, organising large and small events. I am pleased the Bill is not confined to an upper limit on audiences. There was mention of audiences of not more than 2,000. In my estimation the Bill would fail if it maintained that level. There is often more risk attached to a badly organised or badly lit disco or, for instance, in an area which would be more suited to having 300 rather than 600 on the premises. Such an event would be a death trap. Against that background, it is important that we do not stick to numbers in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The Minister said earlier that regulations must be put in place whereby young, old and middle aged people who congregate for leisure pursuits, whether social or educational, will at the end of the night be able to leave the premises safely and in comfort. In other words, we are trying to replicate the safety aspects of their own homes when they congregate in a public place of recreation. While the Bill is wide ranging, it contains a number of potential flaws. The fire service seems to be the lead authority. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">However, the crucial question suggested by this Bill is what actually happens, irrespective of the age group involved, if there is a calamity at an organised function in the middle of the night. Who blows the whistle? That is when accidents happen, not when all the authorities are around. One never sees an accident in a place containing five or six ambulances, gardaí and so on. They do not happen then. People depend on the skills of the organisers and the controls put on these indoor events when the statutory authorities are not there. For example, the fire authority in County Galway is terribly underfunded and it is becoming difficult for its members to carry out their statutory duties. Better machinery, better training and so on, about all of which the Minister knows, should be provided for the fire service in tandem with this Bill. A huge responsibility is being put on the fire service. It is as good an organisation as any other, but if it is to have a meaningful input into this, somebody must realise that in return for the sort of responsibility they are taking on there should be a parallel system of increased funding and investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">As I said earlier, I welcome the fact that this is not a killjoy Bill. We must strike a balance and allow people to do what one would normally expect them to do. There would not be much point in expecting 500 or 1,000 people under 21 to sit down and be nice. Middle-aged people conduct themselves differently. I am amazed at how the organisers of Slane – an outdoor event – are successfully able to manage 60,000 to 80,000 people.</p>

Several members of my family are enthusiastic fans of that event. I welcome the Bill but the Minister must do a lot of thinking about the investment that will be needed in parallel with it to ensure the statutory authorities can do what they are supposed to do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_333">
          <from>Mr. Haughey</from>
          <p eId="para_538">The safety of the public in places of assembly is primarily the responsibility of those who organise the event and those who administer or own the venue in which it is held. This arises from the common law duty of care owed by those in charge of the venue to the patrons who pay to attend the event. It is the joint responsibility of the venue management and the promoter to ensure standards and requirements for safety are strictly observed before, during and after the event. This is the background to the legislation under discussion. Nevertheless, this is not enough to ensure public safety at indoor events. The State is obliged to intervene in this important matter and many Acts are now in place to ensure the public is protected on these occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I regret that this legislation has been a long time coming. It arises from the Hamilton report on crowd control, which was issued in 1990 following the Hillsborough football stadium tragedy in 1989, which is 12 years ago. Public safety and crowd control are literally matters of life and death. We cannot underestimate the importance of this. Too many tragedies have occurred as a result of inadequate attention being paid to crowd control problems. Along with the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989, we have had the Heysel stadium tragedy and the Bradford City fire. There have been other examples closer to home. I have monitored this situation for the last ten years and have observed problems on occasion in Lansdowne Road, Tolka Park and Croke Park in Dublin. Even this year, problems emerged at the All-Ireland Football Final in Croke Park between Armagh and Kerry when too many fans invaded the pitch after the final whistle. Deaths and injuries have occurred as a result of these failures and the challenge now is to eliminate such risks in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">There are many reasons for this Bill's delay and the main one is that a number of Departments have responsibility for the issues involved. I do not believe that a lack of interest in public safety and crowd control is the reason for the delay. I welcome the fact that this Bill is now being taken in the Dáil and I hope it has a speedy passage. Yesterday I listened to the Taoiseach expressing his concerns about the amount of time being  given by this House to legislation. He is of the view that we need to improve this and ensure that legislation is given a primary role in this House and in our debates generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">Since the publication of the Hamilton report in 1990, codes of practice for safety at sports grounds and outdoor pop concerts have been drawn up. For a time, these were relied on for indoor pop concerts too. However, things have changed since then. In May 1996 a young girl from Shanagarry, County Cork, was crushed to death at the Smashing Pumpkins concert in the Point Theatre. Her untimely death was a tragedy and highlighted the inadequacies of the measures in place concerning indoor pop concerts. At her inquest at the Coroner's Court in October 1996, the jury called for a code of practice for indoor concerts and other musical events. This has since been published and this Bill now gives legislative backing to these codes of practice, which is to be welcomed. The Bill is a further important development in improving safety at such events.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Regarding sections 4 and 5, what types of events will be covered by the regulations to be drawn up by the Department? In his Second Stage speech the Minister gave a broad definition of what constitutes an indoor event but we need to be more specific. Many types of events should be covered apart from pop concerts. Another example brought to my attention was the Baby &amp; Kids show in the RDS in April 1996. Those of us with young children will appreciate the importance of Barney the dinosaur in the lives of our very young people. Problems in relation to crowd control emerged at that show and it is not good enough that this should occur when mothers with young children are attending a performance. A potentially serious situation developed on the day but luckily it did not deteriorate to the point that people were injured. We need to be specific about the type of event which will be included in the regulations, though I assume events like those I have mentioned will be covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I also seek clarification of the position of venues like the Point Theatre, where pop concerts take place all year round. A music and singing licence under the Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1890, and a public dancing licence under the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, are in force in respect of the Point. Will this new legislation apply to venues like that and will each particular performance need a licence from the fire authorities? I would welcome clarification as to how this Bill fits in with other Acts governing events like these. What is the situation regarding public houses where musical events take place almost on a nightly basis? This brings us back to the definition of numbers to be set out in regulations where the legislation applies. We must give some thought to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Why is there no provision in section 8 for third party appeals? Third party objectors such as local individuals or others with concerns about an  application, for whatever reason, can play an important role in this process. The Minister should reconsider this ban. The public can get involved in the process under other legislation but in the interests of openness, transparency and accountability the public should be given the right to make their views known in relation to an application for a particular licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Fire prevention officers obviously play an important role when it comes to public safety and crowd control issues. Now we are discussing this issue we need to ask whether there are enough fire prevention officers in our local authorities. Do local authorities have enough staff in place to deal with these responsibilities? I would welcome the Minister's views on this matter. These issues are becoming increasingly complex and technical, while concerts and other such indoor events are becoming increasingly common. We must be particularly vigilant when it comes to the number of fire prevention officers employed by our local authorities. I hope the Department of the Environment and Local Government takes a hands-on approach to this issue, given its importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">We have made a lot of progress since publication of the Stardust tribunal report and we have made great strides in implementing its many recommendations. However, we cannot just sit back and relax when it comes to these matters. We must be vigilant at all times. We must continue to monitor issues such as public safety and crowd control on an ongoing basis. We must keep abreast of new technology, new fashions, new practices and new attitudes among our young people. Every generation is different from the previous one and we need to be aware of changes in the behaviour of our young people. We must be aware of changes in the music they listen to as well as in their dancing and other practices. We must ensure our laws are updated and our codes of practice amended as necessary. These cannot be set in stone and the situation must be kept under ongoing review in association with all the various interested parties, including the Garda, health boards, local authorities and young people. Obviously it is not just young people who attend concerts. All members of the public do so but, as previous speakers said, we recognise that we have a special duty of care to young people for all sorts of reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Sections 15 and 16 deal with prosecution of offences by fire authorities. Those are important sections as there is no point in having the legislation if it is not implemented and enforced. I know from experience that there is disappointment because the Director of Public Prosecutions did not press charges in relation to various tragedies. That brings the law into disrepute. In this case, the fire authorities will initiate prosecutions, which is welcome. Fire officers have the specialised knowledge to deal with these circumstances and they will be familiar with the events taking in place in their areas. They are the experts and I hope they use their powers to the maximum, as set out in this legislation, and that  they will not be slow to act where there are clear breaches of the law. It is important that fire officers use the full powers at their discretion to ensure effective enforcement and to ensure the public can attend events in safety and without fear of injury or death.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">I welcome the Bill. It is a long time in coming as it is 12 years since the publication of the Hamilton report. The Bill has been delayed for various reasons and we must now put the spotlight on how we do our work and process legislation. It is being debated and it will go a long way to ensure that pop concerts and other events are safe. I mentioned the tragedy in 1996 in the Point Depot and said that the family of the girl who died wanted to ensure that nothing like that ever happens again. There have been injuries since then and while that is unacceptable, the family will welcome this legislation. It is unfortunate that it took such an awful tragedy to bring forward a new code of practice but, perhaps, some good has come from it, although it was devastating for the family involved. I look forward to discussing the Bill on Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_334">
          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_549">I welcome the principle behind this Bill but there are problems with some of its provisions and the approach it takes to public safety at indoor events. When we hear of disasters at indoor events abroad, such as the recent fire in a disco in Asia, it brings home to us with greater force the potential for danger when large numbers of people are gathered together. It is incumbent on the State to make provision and regulations so when people come together in large numbers they can be sure of their security. As other Deputies have said, we do not have to look to Asia for examples of terrible tragedy – the Stardust has been mentioned, and it is appropriate that we remember the victims of that awful tragedy and the many families who are still grieving.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">When regulation fails, particularly fire regulation, and people die in such tragic and needless circumstances, we appreciate the great need for such regulation. We should salute those who work to keep us safe through insisting on proper fire regulations. We should salute the fire-fighters in our society who, at great risk to themselves, put their lives and health on the line for the safety of the public. Unfortunately, over the next 48 hours in Northern Ireland and Britain we will see the critical role played by fire-fighters in the negative sense, with the criminal situation whereby the Government and fire authorities in that jurisdiction have left fire-fighters there with no alternative but to take strike action. That is happening only 60 miles from the Dáil as a result of the authorities and Government who undervalue fire-fighters to such a degree that they have to take this action. I take this opportunity to express my solidarity with the fire-fighters in the North and Britain and I want to see an immediate end to the situation by the granting of their legitimate demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill states that it arises from the need to implement the recommendations of the report of the Hamilton committee on crowd control in relation to indoor concerts and the development of a code of practice for safety at indoor concerts. The Bill also includes other events.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The first step proposed is that the Minister prescribe any activity that, according to him, would require a licence and he will make regulations along those lines. We need more information than that. The Hamilton report referred to events with an attendance of over 2,000 but the Minister, in his own speech, encompassed events with an attendance of less than 2,000. It is incumbent on the Minister to be more definite with the Dáil as to what he has in mind. It is unsatisfactory that we do not have a clear idea about the content of the regulations or the thinking of the Minister and the Department with regard to numbers attending, the nature of events and the circumstances in which events would need a licence. I would like to hear the Minister come forward with information along those lines when he replies at the end of this debate. There is a provision that regulations would be laid before the Dáil but if they were unsuitable they would have to be negatived and that is unsatisfactory. The Minister should explain his plans in some detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Would events in local community halls be made the subject of a licence requirement under the regulations the Minister has in mind? We want absolute safety in such halls but we do not want needless bureaucracy that could make it difficult for voluntary community groups. Section 5(9)(<i>c</i>) requires the furnishing by the person applying for the licence of plans, a statement of safety procedures, documents and information to be submitted with an application for a licence. Safety must not be compromised but we want this to be done sensibly so it does not become a bureaucratic nightmare, especially if it relates to community events.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Section 5(9)(<i>d</i>) relates to the payment to the fire authority of such fees as may be prescribed for an application for a licence. If voluntary organisations, community organisations, community centres and so on need a licence the requirement for a fee should not be onerous. Anybody who deals with and assists community groups knows the nightmare that meeting insurance costs entails. I ask the Department to ensure that the level of fees for ordinary working class communities is not prohibitive in the event that the requirement for a licence would touch that particular activity. What happens the big fat cats, the greedy people, who organise big events of a musical nature where they rip off the youth is a different matter and they should be made to pay well.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Will the Minister clarify what precisely is meant by a "building"? The Bill gives it the meaning in the Fire Services Act, 1981. It defines a "building" as, "any building, structure or erection (whether permanent or temporary) of any  kind or of any materials."  That is slightly amended in the Bill to include parts of those buildings or structure. Unfortunately, due to the level of backup and research capacity afforded to Deputies it has not been possible for me to go into a thorough examination of all the regulations that apply across the board and the meanings of this. Will the Minister clarify if this relates entirely to events held under a roof or to events held in a sports ground or some kind of enclosure that is not covered?</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The Bill also provides that the licence application be made to the fire authority. The way the Bill is proceeding to set these structures in train is highly unsatisfactory. Part 3 relates entirely to an amendment of the Fire Services Act, 1981, in various regards. We understand the necessity for watertight fire provisions and obviously the fire authority has a great responsibility, but the Bill purports to be much wider than that. It purports to relate to other issues of public safety even down to sanitary facilities, health facilities and so on. I do not understand why the fire authority would be given the responsibility to supervise the gamut and it is not satisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Section 20(2) provides that one fire authority may contract out this responsibility to another or bring in any person, other than a fire authority, to, presumably, supervise or be involved in drawing up the criteria or assessing the criteria for the grant of a licence. That is not a satisfactory way of dealing with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Section 6 (3) <i>(b)</i> allows for the provision of adequate measures and procedures for securing the safety of persons attending the indoor event; in other words, issues of crowd control and the design of buildings to avoid accidents. Expertise is needed in this area but it is not automatically within the fire authority. That would be a planning issue in one sense but even more so for people with experience in building design to say what can happen in crowds and how to minimise the risk of people being crushed or whatever. Instead of giving all responsibility to the fire authority a dedicated department in the local authority should be mandated to supervise this area. That dedicated department could call on a range of experienced people and agencies in regard to the various aspects that need to be covered, such as the fire authority, planners, health and safety and environmental officers and agencies outside the ambit of local government. Obviously that would require resources which should be provided by the Government to the local authorities who are quite short in terms of financing. That would be a more satisfactory way of approaching it and it would not impose an extra burden on the fire authority which it may not need. Saving us from fire is a heavy enough responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Section 6(3) <i>(c)</i> provides for: “the provision of adequate facilities for the health and welfare of persons attending the indoor event including the adequacy of sanitary facilities.”  I welcome and wholeheartedly agree with that provision and  hope it is implemented. I have had the experience, particularly after some All-Ireland finals, of attending at the hotel, usually a large hotel, of the team I was supporting—</p>

          <p eId="para_561">— whether victorious or not to find thousands crowded in. Quite frankly, the sanitary provisions were not scandalous but an insult to the patrons who attended. In the particular establishment, and it happened in more than one, when one approached the sanitary area one was plunged in a lake of you know what and the most disgusting and foul conditions. This establishment was soaking up money by means of exorbitantly increased prices from the patrons and yet it was treating them in this way. I want to see that section of the Bill implemented. Treating patrons in such a way should be a reason for discontinuing a person's licence. It should be a requirement that the licensee spend some of that money and pay staff well to look after those facilities so that people can use them with dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The Bill provides for the maintenance of public order as one of the criteria. This relates more to the Private Security Services Bill which we discussed yesterday. It entrenches my point about how the licence should be supervised overall. The Bill provides that the number of events can be determined in the licence. I am curious about that because in the event that planning permission was required, that is where the number of events would be laid down. I do not see why it would be included in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Section 8 does not allow a third party appeal and I do not agree with this. There should be provision for a third party appeal because, although perhaps in a case where planning permission was granted, a new situation could arise after the first event was held. A third party – residents or any other person – might have an urgent need to approach the authority responsible for safety at these events and that should be provided for, even where a licence for an event is refused. An event that appeals to young people or which they feel is justified might be refused a licence, and they should have a right of appeal. Section 13 is amazing. It provides that no action can be taken against the authorities responsible for implementing the provisions of this Bill for any damage that arises out of the negligence of the authorities? Why should that be the case if there is negligence or a deliberate major systems failure by the State or an agency of the State. The people who suffer, especially if they are injured, may have recourse to insurance or other means, but I do not see why that should close the other road to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I welcome the principle of the Bill. Greed on the part of big business elements is rampant in many areas, involves large numbers of people and it should be controlled.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kelly</from>
          <p eId="para_566">I wish to share my time with Deputy John Curran.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Young people have rights when they attend music concerts and festivals. Conscientious venue managers, performers, promoters, medical professionals and security firms should respect those rights and work hard to make sure the concert experience is enjoyable and safe. Nevertheless, fans are often killed at rock concerts or festivals or hurt through no fault of their own. People may find themselves in poor or non-existent crowd safety environments at rock, rap or pop gigs that cause discomfort or worse. A conservative estimate would place the number of fans injured at shows in the past seven years at tens of thousands all over the world. Approximately 7,000 Woodstock '94 fans sought first aid alone. Unfortunately, the rock concert industry in general refuses to take the necessary action to make things better. In the US where rock and roll, rap, pop was born, there is not one concert industry crowd safety guideline, rule or standard for concert and festival events. Compare that with the planning that goes into professional sports events, parades, festivals and other public assembly events. Maybe that is why claims and law suits brought by injured US concert-goers are at historic levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Currently the brightest spots are in Britain and Ireland where co-operative efforts between Government safety professionals and rock concert industry members have resulted in workable, outdoor festival safety guidelines. Their efforts represent an impressive start. Nevertheless, more needs to be done. Concert-goers should be able to enjoy a concert in a safe environment. They deserve to be treated with respect by facility management, concert security, entertainers and promoters. They also need to be informed of the responsibilities of a ticket holder and of the concert facility's house rules prior to the purchase of a ticket, and to be notified in a timely manner of changes in the performance, door opening or other information that affects the safety and enjoyment of a concert. In 1996 a young girl aged 17 was killed in a festival seating-mosh pit crowd crush at a concert in Dublin. In 1997 a 16 year-old-girl was killed similarly at a Die Toten Hosen concert in Stuttgart, Germany. Simple safety precautions would have spared these and many other lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">To date, the rock concert industry has done little to establish safety guidelines for a problem they have known to exist for years. Instead, the industry has pursued its usual approach to crowd safety problems by blaming fans for their injuries. However, music fans, a large segment of whom are minors, cannot be expected to be both spec tators and professional crowd safety managers at the same time. Entertainers, venue operators and promoters, as well as hired security have as their legal responsibility the establishment and preservation of a safe environment for patrons who attend their events.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The main provisions of the Bill state that a licence will be required for certain indoor events; the Minister can make regulations prescribing the class or classes of indoor events for which a licence is required and may specify the attendance number threshold above which a licence is required for indoor events; a fire authority will be able to impose conditions in the licence and will be required to have regard to codes of practice such as the code of practice for safety at indoor concerts; an applicant for a licence will have the right to appeal the fire authority's decision to the District Court; persons who organise, promote, hold or are in control of a building where such an event takes place without a licence or not in accordance with the conditions of a licence will be guilty of an offence; Ministers will be given a statutory power to issue codes of practice and notice of issue of such codes shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>; a duty of care on persons organising an event is given a statutory foundation; fire authorities will have a power to inspect indoor events when they are being organised and when they are in progress and will be required to maintain a register of decisions and notices served; and the fire authority can serve a notice stopping an indoor event or any preparations for an indoor event if they have reason to believe that the event is likely to occur without or in contravention of a condition of a licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">I commend the Bill to the House. It is vital that the whole area of concert safety is regulated and that young people can attend a gig and enjoy themselves without their safety being put at risk.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnCurranFF" eId="spk_338">
          <from>Mr. Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_572">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I had some prepared notes but, having listened to some of the previous contributions, I will deviate from them slightly. It is true and also tragic that most safety legislation has come about as a result of a major disaster or accident. The previous speaker referred to an accident at the Point in 1996. Deputy Haughey referred to the Stardust and Hillsborough disasters leading to the Taylor report. It is timely that we are today addressing these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Before I go into the detail of the Bill, I want to set it in context from my personal point of view. I am of an age, despite the fact that most of my colleagues probably do not believe it, to remember Dublin prior to the Stardust disaster. I was a frequent visitor to the Stardust and other venues around Dublin City, such as Toner's and McGonagles, where live music was popular. Venues such as the Stardust were used by many up-and-coming bands, including Thin Lizzy and U2. I accept there was an inquiry and improvements were made after the Stardust disaster and we should look at those. When improvements were made,  people complained that the regulations were too stringent. Every pub and music venue in the country was visited by fire officers and many were forced to make alterations. There was a change in the use of fire retardant materials and exit routes had to be identified and illuminated. One of the key issues was that emergency exits had to be clearly marked and, most importantly, unlocked. It was a feature of the time that patrons would pay in at the front door, make their way to the emergency exit, open it and let others in free. That was quite common around Dublin and, at that time, the most obvious thing to do in some venues was to lock the doors with chains.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">I have personal experience in this area. I am new to politics and, for the last 20 years, I have worked as a company director supplying audio visual equipment to a range of indoor events. The industry has changed significantly in that time. In the early days, safety, security and crowd control were rarely mentioned. Organisers and operators of events, particularly good ones, now look at these matters in meticulous detail. It is quite common for the better organisers to have safety officers who look at a range of issues, not just fire safety but also how venues are set out from car parking to other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Deputy Joe Higgins mentioned fat cats and big operators. Some of them provide an excellent service and show great attention to detail, though not all. Some things I have seen are so shocking that I would not let my children go to some of the venues where I worked, or go to some of the venues I attended as a younger person. In that context, I am pleased with the Bill before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">One aspect of the Bill I particularly wish to address is the Minister's power to make regulations for events. Previous speakers have mentioned events with an audience of more or less than 2,000. Because of the size of the country, the figure should be significantly less than 2,000. Too often when indoor events are spoken of, the mind thinks of rock and pop concerts and discos. However, there are many other events that must be considered because they involve bringing large numbers of people into many different environments. These include stage shows, sporting events such as boxing and basketball in indoor arenas, trade shows and exhibitions where huge numbers of people are brought in, and conferences and seminars. They all need safety measures. Fianna Fáil typically brings 5,000 people to a venue and that generates the same excitement and enthusiasm—</p>

          <from>Mr. Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_580">I will leave that to another Deputy who I will not name. There are also unique events. I listened to Deputy Haughey earlier talk about Barney and the child show, Disney on Ice and other shows which cater for big numbers of people and I hope that, in the regulations, the Minister looks specifically at the wider range of events and extends them to include community facilities. As a newly elected Member who has spent time working in my local community, I know that it was common to run discos without guidelines as to whether the type of hall used was appropriate or safe. The licensing of those is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The regulations should address specific areas including the number of people, the level of supervision and seating arrangements. When I was involved in the industry 20 years ago, seating arrangements and safety did not go hand in hand. There might be seats everywhere and no aisle to exit by. Those aspects need to be considered in detail in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The Bill allows the Minister to issue specific codes of practice, which is very important. It also confers on the operator a statutory duty of care. A previous speaker mentioned safety announcements. Following the Stardust disaster, entertainers or bands at live shows would point out the fire exits – Members have probably been in venues when this happened – but the sound system was so inaudible that the detail could not be heard. These issues must be addressed in the Bill and the detail examined. There is no point making an announcement that cannot be heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Deputy Joe Higgins spoke about fire authorities issuing licences, enforcement and the setting up of a key group to look at monitoring and other matters. That is covered in sections 11 and 12 from my reading of the Bill. Section 11 will empower local authorities to issue a notice of cessation where an event is taking place or is likely to take place without the necessary licence or in contravention of the terms of a licence. Local authorities have a fundamental role to play in seeing that regulations are adhered to; it is not just the fire authorities which are involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Section 12 introduces standard provisions covering powers of entry onto land and powers of inspection by authorised officers and members of the Garda Síochána. Authorised officers would include fire inspection officers and, probably, local authority inspectors. One of the key aspects, often overlooked, is that events should be properly monitored when they are being prepared and set up. To go to a venue after it has been set up makes it difficult to see the detail of how it was arranged. If one looks at modern stage shows with their fancy equipment, the detail that goes into them cannot be seen. An inspection during the set-up stage, as provided for in section 12, is important. It also allows gardaí fairly free entry, not just from the perspective of fire safety but of crowd control, drug misuse and other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">For this Bill to be effective, it will require additional work from fire officers and my hope  and understanding is that they will be adequately resourced to do this. I do not want to see a situation arise where the Bill is passed and fire safety officers must make hasty decisions. The Bill is for public safety and it is important that those who must implement it are resourced adequately to do so. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_343">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_586">I am glad to have an opportunity to comment on this Bill and I will do so on a broad basis before I refer to the Bill more specifically. It is important legislation and has been awaited for some time. As previous speakers pointed out, the Hamilton committee sat first in 1989 and made a number of recommendations regarding soccer, rugby and GAA games. It also made recommendations on major race meetings, open air concerts and events, and indoor concerts and events with which this Bill deals. The factors examined then in regard to events were overcrowding, crushing, crowd surges, fire safety, violence, structural standards, physical layout of venues etc. The final Hamilton report made 73 recommendations many of which referred to indoor pop concerts. The key recommendations in regard to pop concerts were that all major indoor pop concert promotions, where the anticipated attendance exceeded 2,000, should be licensed on an individual basis by the District Court and a minimum of two months' notice should be provided in an application for a licence for a major indoor or outdoor pop concert promotion.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Despite the fact that a committee on public safety and crowd control, under the chairmanship of Liam Hamilton, reported in February 1990, it was October 1996 before the then Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, announced in the Dáil that the question of safety at indoor concerts would be examined and that a voluntary code of practice would be put in place. A working group chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government was appointed and it took responsibility for the preparation of the code. The chairman of that group was Mr. Ray Dollard. The group included personnel from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science, the Garda Síochána and Dublin Corporation. The code of practice for safety at indoor concerts was published in 1998 and we have waited four years for this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Safety at both indoor and outdoor events must be kept under constant examination because of the nature of events and the attitudes of those attending. In previous generations people were generally disciplined enough to ensure that issues which arise now did not arise then. There was more self imposed discipline, but things have changed. We now have the influence of the drug culture where drugs, in particular ecstasy, are in wide use before and during these events. Alcohol and different forms of cocktails also make it more difficult to control crowds and ensure they act  responsibly. Although this Bill is welcome we will need to go beyond what is outlined in it in regard to indoor events.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The Bill refers to large events but I am concerned about events that will attract crowds of less than 2,000. Even small indoor events should come under scrutiny. Any of us who have visited dance halls around the country in hotels or community centres etc. will have seen that many of the windows and exits are locked and secure. If there was an outbreak of fire or other problems not all the exits or windows could be opened. Local authorities, the Garda and other relevant authorities should scrutinise all indoor centres where events take place, including community meetings. All those event organisers, authorities, owners of centres and people responsible for community facilities must accept some responsibility. If they are involved they must ensure that proper safety procedures are recognised and put in place at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">This Bill mentions pop concerts and music events but it does not mention major indoor sporting events. Consideration should be given to these in the Bill because of the numbers they attract. We have been promised an indoor stadium which will attract large numbers and provisions for that should be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">There has been concern about outdoor events, particularly since the tragedy at Hillsborough in 1989. The major sporting organisations have improved safety procedures considerably but there are still dangerous incidents at times that could lead to catastrophe. Often people become negligent and casual about basic common sense procedures. They need to be reminded that safety is paramount and it should be the overriding consideration rather than the number of people who will pay to get through the gate. That attitude does not always manifest itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I attended a major indoor event recently and noticed that basic facilities such as first-aid and toilet facilities were not clearly marked – one had to search for them. It would be easy to provide a leaflet showing people attending an event where facilities are, where they can contact security or get first-aid etc. It is important that people are provided with this information and it should be part of the safety code.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">A lot of this is common sense and a lot has to do with understanding the law. Event organisers generally refer any legal issues to their legal team and have little knowledge themselves of their legal obligations. Knowledge and understanding of their legal obligations should be mandatory for all people organising events. They should also understand the legislation attached to the running of major centres and events.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">We have an opportunity now to amend this Bill and improve it. A number of people made suggestions and some good and practical contributions were made. We have waited 13 years since the Hamilton report for this legislation. I am sure experts in this area will have examined  the legislation closely. This is the ideal opportunity to make the Bill effective for the next 25 to 30 years to ensure we do not have to revisit this area in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">A number of examples were referred to and Deputy Allen, especially, referred to a major catastrophe that happened in America and how legislation resulted from that which has global application. There should be a trawl of international legislation in this area to ensure the Bill is in keeping with the thinking in other countries. There are similarities between the legislation and that in the United Kingdom. That is important because many people who attend events in Ireland also go to the UK for similar events. Perhaps the Minister's officials would confirm that the Bill is similar to the UK legislation. There could also be a broader application of the legislation in the European context.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The licensing of indoor events is timely and perhaps should have been introduced before now. Obviously this was not straightforward legislation and it has had a long thought process since 1989 and through 1996. Perhaps the Minister in implementing the legislation would examine issues that have arisen in the context of outdoor events. It is an area which needs to be revisited. One of the reasons the IRFU and FAI say Lansdowne Road needs to be either demolished or completely revamped is safety. Those of us who attended matches there recently can understand that. Safety is one of the main reasons we need a stadium for rugby and soccer. Perhaps the Minister's officials might also clarify if the legislation relates to indoor sporting events.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_597">Many people alluded to the fact that a girl died in 1996 because of problems with crowd control and crowd surges. I knew her very well. I was teaching at the time and she was a student in the school in which I taught. She was a lovely girl and I pay tribute to her memory. It was something that should not have happened and let us hope nothing like it ever happens again. At the time my heart went out to the family and to her friends who were greatly traumatised by the event. When my children attend concerts and events, I am always concerned that something might happen and I am sure many other parents feel the same about their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">I welcome the Bill. It is long overdue because it is six years since that event occurred and longer since this area was first examined. I have read the Bill, listened to what others have had to say and have a few points to make on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">It is important that, irrespective of whether an event has an entry charge or is free, it is covered, and that should be made clear in the legislation. It is not stated explicitly in the Bill and is perhaps something which should be examined as there could be a loophole.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Greater responsibility is being placed on the fire authorities and it is important that they be given adequate resources to cope with this extra  workload. It is not good enough to give them the extra responsibility without ensuring they have the resources, staff and training to cope with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Best practice internationally in this area should be examined. I am sure it is happening but it should be ongoing. Some method should be put in place for conducting research on this area. Different types of indoor events will come about and we need to keep up with best practice internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">It is ironic that we debated the regulation of the private security industry last week and today the regulation of indoor events because there is a relationship between the two. When I spoke on the other Bill last week, I said it was important that people who work in the private security industry receive proper training. It is also important that people who run indoor events also have a certain amount of training in running such events because a great deal of responsibility is involved. People need to know what they are doing before they run these events. The fire service could hold seminars throughout the country so that people who run concerts and musical events would have access to training and learn best practice. It is not a huge issue but it should happen as a result of the Bill being passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Reference has already been made to other types of indoor events, such as concerts, boxing tournaments, indoor sports and so on. I note the Bill appears to focus on concerts and musical events. Perhaps that needs to be widened to include all types of indoor events.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">On the issue of fire drills, the bells rang last night in Leinster House, yet no one left the building.

          <p eId="para_606">In schools and other places, when fire alarms ring, nothing seems to happen. It is important we have proper fire drills and that we take more notice of and responsibility for them. I do not recall a fire drill in Leinster House in the past five years. Perhaps it is something we should examine. Some Deputies mentioned the need for proper safety announcements. At events such as these it is crucial that safety announcements be made and the public be informed where the exits are and how to leave if something goes wrong. There must be proper emergency lighting that works and the exits must open properly. In the event of people leaving a venue at night-time, there must be lighting outside also.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">There is considerable concern among the medical fraternity about noise levels especially at concerts where people's hearing can be damaged. Even if it is not appropriate to this Bill, it should be considered at some stage. In years to come I  can envisage people taking claims against concert promoters, etc., because their hearing has been damaged and we should examine that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">In the case of large indoor events, local hospitals should be informed that an event is taking place as part of the code. If something unforeseen were to occur, there should be communication between the event organisers, emergency services and the hospital, so that it would be possible to get people quickly and safely to the hospital. That requires having ambulances in position so that they can be accessed by first aid personnel on site and can get safely away from the venue. Sufficient people trained in first aid should be at the venue and they should be easily identifiable. We should be grateful to the Red Cross, the Order of Malta, St. John's Ambulance and other groups who perform this service at many events for free. We must ensure that first aid personnel who know what they are doing are present and the event organisers should assist and facilitate them in every way.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">When large numbers of people, especially younger people, are travelling to and from events, accidents can occur and we should consider the need for safety there also. Obviously we need to be aware of the need to limit abuse of alcohol and drugs at some of these events. I note particularly the use of ecstasy at these events and some tragedies have occurred when people have used ecstasy and have died because of dehydration. Event organisers must take account of this. We cannot condone and must condemn in every possible way the use of illegal drugs. However, it does happen and the event organisers should be aware of, prepared for and trained in procedures to assist people who are under the influence of illegal drugs at these events.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">I hope the fire services and other authorities are given the resources, training and backup to perform the functions and responsibilities that will be required of them under this Bill. I note the need for a register of events to be made available in fire offices during office hours. We should consider making it more widely available than that perhaps through Garda stations, because fire offices may not be that accessible to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">I welcome this important Bill and I am glad to see it before the House at last. There is probably room for additions and improvements to it and I hope it will be enacted quickly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_347">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_612">I thank all the Deputies for their contributions and for providing an informed and worthwhile initial debate on the Bill. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, who was here for part of the Second Stage debate and heard many of the comments, is heartened, as I am, by the consensus in the House on the importance of the Bill and the need to enact it at the earliest possible opportunity. As the Minister said, the objective of the Bill is to ensure public safety at indoor events and I am confident the provisions of the Bill will  achieve that. The Bill bridges the safety gap to allow the regulation of such events and will give public authorities the necessary legislative backing to prevent or control potentially unsafe concerts for the benefit of the performers and public alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">When enacted this legislation will require promoters or organisers to demonstrate to the fire authority in advance of any event that they can run the event safely. The Minister has already spoken about the serious issues surrounding the need to introduce a system of licensing for indoor events. It was important therefore in developing this legislation, that the deficiencies in the existing licensing systems with regard to crowd safety and control were addressed and that a proper system of licensing was put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">This is good and workable legislation that clarifies the roles of both the public authorities and the promoters. At the moment, promoters and venue owners consult a range of local authority departments, Government Departments and public agencies when organising an event. The creation of a one-stop-shop type of system where the fire authority will co-ordinate the various inputs and requirements, with the granting of a licence with appropriate conditions or refusal being the result of the process. This will streamline the management of such events for both promoters and public bodies. Promoters and event organisers have welcomed this development.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The Bill will fully implement the principle that the promoter has responsibility for public safety issues and it introduces a statutory footing for the Hamilton report recommendation that all major indoor pop concert promotions, where the anticipated attendance exceeds 2,000, should be licensed on an individual basis. As mentioned by many Deputies, the Bill will go even further and will provide the power to regulate categories of events with fewer than 2,000 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">Many Deputies spoke of the thresholds that will apply and the type of premises that will come under this legislation. The nature of certain performances has changed significantly in recent years with the emergence of new acts and trends. There is also greater public concern over public safety issues, particularly where young people are involved and where more than one performance or function is taking place under the same roof. The attendance number thresholds are not included in the Bill. The Minister intends to prescribe the appropriate thresholds in regulations to be made under the Act. This will allow flexibility in classifying categories of events with approved thresholds. The comments made by Deputies here will help the Minister and his officials revisit the issues in this regard and ensure all categories of events are covered. Officials from the Department have been in consultation with senior fire officers throughout the country since the Bill was first published in 2001 and the advice of fire authorities will be incorporated in drafting the necessary regulations in relation to the operation of the licensing system.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The Bill provides for the Minister to prescribe in regulations any large event deemed to pose a crowd safety risk, including indoor sporting events, commercial exhibitions in the RDS or other large venues, private corporate events and conferences including Ard-Fheiseanna and shows aimed primarily at children and young people. It would be impossible to identify in the Act all such events, present and future, which is why flexibility is maintained to prescribe such events by regulation. The numbers to be prescribed will be identified in regulations having regard to audience profile, ie children or young adults or an older audience, a rave or a Cliff Richard concert, the amount of seating provided and venue capacity. This could range from 750 to 2,000 plus, depending on the nature of the event. However, I will clarify this issue as we move to Committee Stage having regard to Deputies' comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Deputies have of course referred to the Stardust tragedy and the progress made in the intervening years, both in legislation and on the operation front to prevent the reoccurrence of such a tragedy. This Bill will supplement the development and progress made since then. Indeed, as the code of practice for safety at indoor concerts identifies in chapter 14, there is a vast array of legislation which governs existing events and provides for safety at the vast majority of such events. The principle legislation includes regulation or licensing for entertainment events by urban authorities under the Public Health (Amendment) Act, the Licensing Acts and the Fire Services Act, the Ease of Escape Regulations (Means of Egress and Ingress), the Planning Acts, 1963 to 2000 and the Building Control Act, 1990. Many of the events Deputies have referred to are already well controlled and regulated by such legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The code of practice itself which is now given statutory backing in this Bill sets out both the category of event in table 3.10, including the type of concert, audience profile and occupancy load factors and in table 3.11 whether for individual seating, dance floor area and standing audience area. We are fortunate that safety has been to the forefront for some time in two codes of practice. On Safety at Sports Grounds and Outdoor Concerts, published by the Department of Education in 1996, set the standards for major events. Putting in place a further code of practice for safety at indoor concerts underpins much of this new Bill. The code, published in 1998, reflects the general principles of safety and the organisational parameters set out in other codes. The 71 page code provides advice and guidance on the matters involved in the safe organisation and running of an indoor concert. Advice and guidance from codes of practice developed in other countries were also taken into account in the preparation of the code and we will continue to monitor and update codes in the light of national and international experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The code has worked to good effect in the intervening period although it has no statutory basis. Only promoters wishing to engage in best practice observed the full guidance set out in the code. The promoters who did not comply with the guidance could not be held accountable sufficiently in the courts. In the new Licensing of Indoor Events Bill this code will be put on a statutory basis. Applicants must show compliance with the code and fire authorities must have regard to relevant codes of practice when deciding on licence applications. The Minister has noted the concerns of many Deputies that promoters and organisers as well as venue owners be subject to the Bill's requirements and this is our intention.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">In addition to the introduction of the new system for the licensing of indoor events, the Bill also deals with strengthening the enforcement provisions of the Fire Safety Acts, 1981. The Bill clarifies the powers of fire authorities to prosecute summary offences and strengthens the inspection powers of authorised persons, providing them with options beginning with breaches of the Act by a person in control of a premises. The Bill also makes provision for the withdrawal of fire safety notices and updates provisions for penalties and service of notices. These changes, which have been sought by senior fire officers over the years, will allow straightforward enforcement to be exercised by fire officers which will lead to more effective enforcement activity called for by Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">In regard to investment in the fire service, I am pleased to report on continuing developments and progress. Local fire authorities currently spend approximately €120 million annually in providing their fire and emergency services. This sum is augmented by grants from the Department of the Environment and Local Government towards capital provisions for the service. The fire services capital programme forms part of the Department's strategy to support the fire authorities in the development and maintenance of a quality fire-fighting and rescue service. Since 1980, some €175 million has been invested by the State in the programme which has enabled the completion of over 120 new or refurbished fire station projects and the purchase of over 430 fire appliances and other fire fighting, emergency and rescue equipment.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">We will ensure that when this Bill is enacted we will augment the provisions of it. It will be the intention of the Department to implement all aspects of the Bill because it is in the interests of safety and it is difficult to put a price on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">I was outlining the commitment of the Government to the fire service which also includes the development of a new computer aided mobilisation project, or CAMP. As a result of this investment, the vast majority of high-volume fire stations in the country will up-date buildings with all the required facilities for modern fire brigades. Practically all fire appliances now on the road have been provided through State aid. The CAMP project, which is one of the most significant developments in the fire service capital programme in recent years, is well advanced. It will provide fire authorities with an efficient and reliable mobilisation and communications system to ensure that the best positioned fire brigades are alerted, having regard to the location and nature of any incident, mobilised properly and respond efficiently to call-outs. During my recent visit to fire stations in Cork, I was pleasantly surprised with the response to a number of calls to CAMP in Limerick. In addition to the communications equipment at fire stations, the units, while on their way, also have contact with CAMP in Limerick for the south of Ireland or Castlebar for the rest of the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_641">I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House. We are fortunate that it has been a long time since the last serious rail disaster, at Cherryville Junction in 1983, where seven passengers lost their lives. However, deaths still occur on Irish rail lines. Just four months ago, at Woodfarm in County Limerick, a fatal accident occurred at a manual rail crossing. This is just one of over 150 accidents at rail crossings since January 1998. Sinn Féin believes that the primary public interest in rail travel is that the highest possible safety standards should be adhered to. Irish citizens, passengers and workers alike deserve no less on Irish railways. I welcome the decision to set up the Railway Safety Commission independently of both larnród Éireann and the Minister's Department. With even the best of intentions, there is a contradiction between safety and profit. Regardless of whether the temptation to put commercial interests before safety is acted upon, it is always there. It has been a sad feature of transport privatisations in other countries that cutbacks in safety are often targeted by companies concerned primarily with profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">In Britain, the inquiry into the Paddington rail disaster, in which 30 people lost their lives, recommended that the operating company, Railtrack, be stripped of its responsibility for setting  safety standards for train operators. Instead. a new independent safety body was proposed to set safety standards and monitor the rail industry's safety performance. The inquiry into this tragedy recognised that the demand to maximise profits involved the sacrifice of safety. Commercial considerations should not be allowed to compromise safety and I welcome the setting up of a commission which can be guaranteed to put the safety of the passengers and the employees before profit or cost cutting. The commission will replace the railway inspectors office and will have a much wider breadth of responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">For example, the new commission will have power to intervene in railway operations that violate the agreed safety case. It will have wide powers of investigation and enforcement of safety regulations and the Bill also provides for the setting up of a tribunal of inquiry by the Minister in consultation with the commission. These changes and others are a vast improvement over the somewhat limited powers that were available to the railway inspector's office. Another welcome feature is the fact that the commission will be properly staffed and maintained to allow it to fulfil its remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">It is clear that the previous system was wholly inadequate. In 1996, International Risk Management Services, IRMS, was commissioned to review the safety procedures in operation on the State's railways. The IRMS report, published in 1998, pointed to what it described as 22 "unreasonable risks", defined as aspects of the rail infrastructure, systems or processes that either posed an immediate risk of fatality or injury or fell short of best practice. Despite this, a review of that report found that while four of these "unreasonable risks" had been dealt with, a further 11 had come to light in the meantime. With safety standards of such breathtaking inadequacy, it is legitimate to ask why it has taken the Government so long to bring adequate legislation before the House. An independent railway safety commission will ensure that commercial interests will not be allowed to interfere with the objective of making sure that rail travel is as safe as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">While the Bill is generally welcome, elements of it need attention. In particular, section 87 provides for the imposition of random sampling of workers employed by the rail companies. I note that the types of employees subject to this kind of testing are restricted to those who work in certain capacities deemed to be high risk areas and that the procedures for testing are to be drawn up in consultation with the Unions. However, I remain concerned about the extension of the powers to carry out random drug and alcohol tests on employees. The Bill allows for the sampling of persons working for the company if there is a suspicion they are intoxicated or if, following an incident, there is a suspicion of someone involved being intoxicated at the time. While I welcome  these parts of the Bill, it goes on to permit the random testing of staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">Random drug and alcohol testing should only be undertaken in the most extreme circumstances, given that the experience can be degrading and humiliating. The benefits of random testing have never been conclusively proved either as a deterrent or a method of discovering which employees are using intoxicants. It is a violation of the rights of workers and their dignity. Without concrete, comprehensive evidence to prove its worth I would ask the Minister to revisit the issue of giving railway companies such wide-ranging powers. These are open to abuse in the form of harassment of workers if used improperly, particularly considering the sometimes poisonous atmosphere and lack of trust between management and workers in Iarnród Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I would be more worried about fatigue suffered by train drivers and similar staff. There have been a number of occasions, well documented to the Minister, where drivers, in particular, have complained about being made to work shifts of up to 18 hours. The Minister should recommend to the commission, upon its formation, that this issue be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I hope this legislation will address other issues of paramount importance regarding safety. Anyone who travels on trains is familiar with the problems of overcrowding. Passengers on Intercity rail often have to pick their way over passengers forced to sit on the floor and around overflowing luggage bins. Decades of Government failure to invest in Irish rail networks mean that people are crammed on to trains like cattle for export. In the event of a serious accident the dangers for passengers are all too clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">There is a particular danger for those rail passengers who are disabled or wheelchair bound. They are still on occasion forced to travel in the mail van as there are no proper facilities for them on some of the older train models. One can only imagine the horror of someone with a serious mobility problem stuck in a mail van in the event of a serious accident or train crash. I hope the Minister ensures that special attention is paid by the Railway Safety Commission to the particular plight of this group of passengers. I take this opportunity to urge the Minister to do all he can to ensure that the current rail fleet is upgraded so that the special needs of disabled people are met.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The Railway Advisory Council is another positive element in this Bill. I applaud especially the decision to appoint representatives from the public and organisations representing the interests of mobility-impaired persons. I find it somewhat troubling, however, that there is a discrepancy in the representation rights of management and workers on this council. Under section 79(3) of the Bill membership of the council includes "at least four persons representing railway undertakings" and "at least three persons from organisations which represent staff of railway undertakings"  I ask the Minister to consider altering the legislation to ensure that unions and management  have equal right to representation on the Railway Advisory Council. I further ask him to ensure that every effort is made in consultation with all unions in Iarnród Éireann to ensure the widest possible representation of workers and that, in as much as it is possible, no group of workers are left without representation on the advisory council.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I hope the Minister will take notice of the issues I have raised concerning this legislation. I request that he does his utmost, despite the heavy legislative schedule before the House, to move the Bill rapidly through its remaining Stages.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_363">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_652">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Railway Safety Bill, 2001. The Government and Governments for the past 20 or 30 years have got the wrong end of the stick on rail safety. When it comes to transport safety, railways are the safest form. They always have been, and CIE, in fairness to it, has a reasonably good record on rail safety. The Government's investment in the railway system, by contrast, has been nothing short of disgraceful. If safety is the consideration in transport issues why have we pumped twice or three times the amount of money into a road-based system over the past 30 years? We know that the death rate on roads far exceeds that on the railway, which is a safe transport system by comparison.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">We listened earlier to the debate on the Licensing of Indoor Events Bill, 2001, and the risks to young people of incidents such as, for example, the terrible accident which occurred in the Stardust. I thought, as I listened to the contributions, that we have the equivalent number of deaths on our roads every month or two and we do nothing about it. The Government insists on pumping more money into the road system while effectively dismantling the rail system. My colleague, Deputy Naughten, raised the matter of the slow speeds in certain sections of the rail system. The point was made earlier that all the Government is doing about rail safety is abolishing the system. We will not have a railway system in a few years if the Government continues on its way, and that would be much more dangerous. There will be nobody on the railways but there will be more people on the roads and the result will be carnage on the roads. The Government has completely missed the truth of how to make transport safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">I have been involved in transport campaigns for years. As a cycling campaigner, I have become more and more impressed with railway engineers because of the complexity of the system. It is very different from other modes of transport. When compared to road transport, the railway system is a very complex system, with different engineering requirements. Engineers have moved from waterway systems of transport to road systems and from cars to buses, and made the switch fairly simply, but they do not seem to be able to make the switch to the rail system because it is different and complex.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">The controversy about the signalling system in terms of the contract involving Esat showed how complex that system is. It was difficult for Iarnród Éireann to get the system right. It has failed to provide a signalling system for the capital. The best way to improve public transport in the city centre is to concentrate on railways, but that is beyond CIE's current capabilities. They have to postpone the project to 2008. That is a safety issue because signalling is at the core of safety. The Government seems happy with that position. A new signalling system was promised four or five years ago but nothing has been done. The year 2008 is six years away and who really cares?</p>
          <p eId="para_656">Rail safety is very complex. During the last main rail dispute with ILDA one of the key arguments was about safety. There was no clear agreement. Experts were brought in from different international rail bodies who disagreed on whether work practices were safe. It is difficult and complex to decide what is safe. The commission will have a valuable function in providing an independent analysis of safe practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">People with experience of rail services will be needed on any such commission. I understand from discussions with people in the rail business that there is a world of difference between a light rail system and a heavy rail system. A system like the Luas which runs along O'Connell Street or St. Stephen's Green has completely different safety requirements than a mainline rail service with trains travelling at 70 miles per hour. We do not have experience in light rail and we will need to learn about it. I do not know where the commission will acquire the expertise because it does not exist in Ireland. In Holland and in cities like Copenhagen and Sheffield which have light rail, there is an awareness of safety issues. We must take into account that people could be knocked down by crossing inadvertently in front of a tram. The engineering and safety expertise will have to be found initially outside the State because it is not available here.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">I am concerned that the Bill is long overdue. There is a procurement agency working on the metro system. The Luas system is being constructed. We charge in after the building is complete to say that there is a body which will tell us how to make the system safe. We have effectively designed the system, or employed overseas contractors to do so, and we are tacking safety considerations on afterwards. The commission will find that very difficult because the negotiations are over. I hope the negotiations have been completed in terms of the metro, although I doubt it given the Government's lack of commitment to public transport. It has probably gone the way of every other public transport project that has been promised. The problem we face as regards safety is that we are tacking it on afterwards. I would love to hear the Minister for Transport explain how he intends to retrospectively fit safety into the design of the new systems that are being put in place, as it is a difficult thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">When the Minister introduced this Bill, he asked for opinions about drug testing. I share the views of my colleague, Deputy Crowe, in so far as I am very wary of random drug testing in case it might be seen to impinge on civil liberties. I am not too sure if the benefits of random drug testing have been proven. I am happy enough to see drug testing for those who are carrying out particularly sensitive jobs, but I would be reluctant to introduce random drug or alcohol tests on a general basis. I do not have a definite view on the matter, but my instinct would be to oppose such a provision as I am uncomfortable about some of the implications for civil liberties.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">When I examined international safety models, I became very interested in a Swedish road safety policy that epitomises a general safety policy that could be adopted here. It seems we often look to Scandinavia for examples of best practice, but the Swedish aim of zero deaths on the roads would be a good target for the Irish transport systems. Everything is meticulously planned in Sweden with the aim of zero deaths in mind. All other provisions trickle down from the overall principle. The Government's transport policy should prioritise a rail-based system, which would require the type of massive investment currently being provided for the roads. The National Roads Authority has admitted that many of the motorways being built at present are not needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Iarnród Éireann will be called Iarnród Átha Cliath in a few years' time, as the only rail lines in the country will be those serving Dublin. When the Minister is happy that he has shut down the unprofitable lines, juggernauts will plough through our towns and cities, creating huge environmental damage and killing many people. As I have said on previous occasions, a number of people equivalent to the number of casualties of the Stardust fire die on our roads each month and, as in the Stardust tragedy, most of the victims are young people. We will look back and ask why we did not invest in our railway system, why commuter services to Galway, Cork and Limerick from neighbouring towns were not established and why a complex variety of rail services was not put in place. It is perfectly possible to establish safety mechanisms after such investment has taken place and the commission being established in this Bill is a step in the right direction in that regard. I would love to be proven wrong, but I have no faith in the Government's ability to develop efficient public transport systems.</p>

          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_662">I welcome the Railway Safety Bill, 2001, which is long overdue. While the Irish railways have a reasonable safety record, there has been a number of incidents in recent years. It has been mentioned in the House that a lady lost her life at a level crossing in County Limerick, close to my constituency, earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I wish to focus initially on the need for safety issues, which are addressed in this Bill, to relate to the need for disabled persons to be properly  accommodated on our rail network. Before this year's general election, the Disability Federation of Ireland wrote to all the political parties and election candidates to set out its demands for inclusion in the programme for Government. The federation said:</p>
          <p eId="para_664">We need bold and radical action, supported by major improvements and sustained investment, to ensure that people with disabilities and their families catch up and are at a point where they can equally participate in Irish society. This is about investment in people with disabilities and not about the costs. It is about enhancing the lives and capacity of Irish people with disabilities and their families and it is done primarily through the employment of other people in the community. Health and personal social services are a necessary part of the national infrastructure which supports and enhances the further development of economic activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">An Agreed Programme for Government, produced by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Unprecedented opportunity has been given, uniquely to us in this generation. It is the opportunity to build a fair society of equal opportunity and of sustained prosperity on an island at peace with itself. We aim to be an inclusive society but there are those who still remain left out. We are committed to building service provision and legislative frameworks which enable people with disabilities to fulfil their potential and make a full contribution to the economic and social life of our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">I hope resources will be made available as a result of this Bill to ensure that persons with disabilities are able to use our rail system to the fullest extent. Significant funding will have to be extended to the rail system to ensure that it is accessible to persons with disabilities. We cannot allow the situation to continue which has pertained in the recent past whereby persons using wheelchairs have to travel in storage carriages or in other forms of transport attached to carriages. Iarnród Éireann's rolling stock must be updated and made accessible to persons with disabilities. Until recently, carriages dating from the 1950s and 1960s were used as rolling stock and carriages that are over 30 years old, which are not accessible to persons with disabilities, are still in use. This must be addressed immediately by the Railway Safety Bill in an effective manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The question of funding is a huge one. We need continuous welded rail, level crossings of reasonable standards of safety and additional carriages so that our trains are no longer overcrowded. Rail stations must be updated to modern standards and made accessible to those who use wheelchairs. Railway lines must be properly fenced off so that young, and not so young, people cannot get on to the track. This has been a major safety issue in recent times as fatalities have occurred  when people have been struck by passing trains having freely walked on to open lines. I know that some fencing has been undertaken in recent years, but we need to ensure that all our lines are properly secured and that public access is prevented. A number of accidents have also been caused by animals wandering on to railway lines.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">I welcome the establishment of the Railway Safety Commission, which is independent from the Department of Transport and Iarnród Éireann. Similarly, the creation of a Railway Advisory Council is a welcome development. As Deputy Eamon Ryan said, however, the funding of the road network on a priority basis is an important issue which is related to this Bill. The importance of this issue can be seen in practical terms in the current debate about the discontinuation of rail freight services. The underfunding of our railway service over many years has caused the current difficulties. We will see the effect of this when a huge amount of freight is transferred on to our dangerous roads from a railway system which is reasonably safe at present. Unfortunately, large numbers of people die on our roads on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">Iarnród Éireann proposes to transfer onto the road system the contents of 11 keg trains per day, Monday to Friday, three trains per day from Tara Mines, Monday to Friday, three trains per day carrying shale, Monday to Friday, five beet trains per day, Monday to Saturday, from October to December, 11 liner trains per day, Monday to Friday, one palletised cement train per day, Monday to Friday, 26 bulk cement trains per week and two SOI trains per week. This is a transfer of huge economic activity from the rail to the road network, which is totally inadequate and leads to safety concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The current SOI train which leaves the North Wall depot for Sligo will be replaced by 75 road tankers carrying the same quantity of oil. The Guinness keg consignment will now be hauled by road from Dublin to rail depots in Galway, Ballina, Claremorris and Cork for unloading by rail staff. Some 100 lorries, working seven days per week, will be required to transfer the beet crop from Wellington Bridge to Mallow. The same scenario will be repeated, and multiplied, with the remainder of rail freight traffic being carried by road. The Government's transport policy must be looked at to ensure the continuation of rail freight services. The same considerations arise, including from a safety point of view, in regard to the proposed closure by Iarnród Éireann of the railway lines between Limerick Junction and Rosslare and Limerick and Ballybrophy.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The other issue which arises in relation to the Bill is that of profit and the privatisation of services. This has been referred to in recent times. The Bill will, to some extent, create a situation whereby safety on the rail system will be put on an independent and reasonable footing. It will ensure an independent commission will police the system. The privatisation of rail services in  Britain in recent years has led to serious accidents involving loss of life and serious injury.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">I welcome the Bill, even though some sections will need to be fleshed out on Committee Stage. Generally, I welcome the proposed appointment of the independent commission and the rail safety advisory council. I have serious concerns in regard to Iarnród Éireann's current policy to discontinue freight services and close certain lines.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_365">
          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_674">I welcome this debate which is somewhat overdue. I am conscious of the fact that we are addressing just one aspect of rail services, even though safety is very important. We are talking about rail services in isolation from other developments, which is very difficult. That is the reason I have concerns about the general approach shown to date by the Minister in respect of his portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">There has been massive development in recent years and the big difficulty is that it has happened in a completely unplanned and incoherent manner. This has now resulted in a very heavy concentration of development on the east coast while many rural areas are suffering serious decline. In other words, no one at Government level sat down in recent years to attempt to direct development which has happened in a very haphazard way which has proven to be unsustainable from a number of points of view. This development has led to the diminution of the quality of life for many citizens, whether in the overcrowded capital city, towns on the east coast or rundown and abandoned towns and villages in the west. The result is that people are increasingly spending large portions of their day trying to commute on a transport system which is wholly inadequate, has not been properly planned and very much geared towards car users.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The bottom line is that we are now suffering from the absence of any kind of spatial planning. For many years the Government has been promising a proper spatial plan. I understand from media reports one is due to be announced very soon, but it is several years too late as a huge amount of development has already taken place which it is too late to direct. That type of planning was needed ten or 15 years ago. We need spatial planning and a clear commitment from Government to ensure transport services are used as a means of achieving social good. Regrettably, what we have seen from the current Minister and his predecessor is an ideological attitude towards public transport which treats public transport and many other public services as merely a function of the market, where the market dictates the level, location and quality of the service. I fear this ideological and skewed view of the world in relation to public transport is probably more pronounced in the case of the Minister than his predecessor. Public transport, including railways, must be seen as an integral part of social infrastructure and a major tool in assisting even-spread development and growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I hope the spatial plan will include a major section relating to the role of public transport in achieving social objectives which can be achieved through logical and committed promotion of good transport systems. Well planned and resourced transport systems will enable us to achieve a whole range of objectives within the State. There is a need for a positive attitude to public transport. In recent years, in the light of the strength of the car and roads lobbies, both have taken precedence over any commitment to public transport. This has resulted in unsustainable development. I hope the Government, in particular the Minister, will see the development of public transport as a means of ensuring even-spread development, ensuring access for everyone, irrespective of their geographical location or social class, in terms of work, retail possibilities or recreation.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">There are other concerns, however, apart from access and development, including environmental issues. Clear decisions have been taken to favour road developments and the car lobby rather than public transport and these have had an environmental price. One need only go out to any street in the centre of Dublin and measure the levels of toxins in the air to see the results of traffic congestion. There are means of dealing with this, which entail a commitment to public transport to serve and link our cities and rural towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">There are also safety concerns. I concur with many of the points made by Deputy Ryan: if we are serious about safety, rail, or any form of public transport, is far safer than a private motor car. For that reason alone I would like to see the emphasis switching from roads to a strong commitment to and promotion of public transport. In recent months the Minister has adopted a scattergun approach. He has been flitting around like a bird, landing on different issues that happen to be topical on a certain day and making public announcements about them. I wonder why he is not present for today's debate. It has been two whole days since he made any announcement. He is probably out speaking to the media again.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_366">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_367">
          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_681">He has certainly been very active in the media, landing on issues and giving responses off the top of his head without any regard for any previous thinking in the area or the authorities with responsibility in those areas and clearly without any overall strategy. He has certainly created many hostages to fortune in recent months and Deputy Naughten and I look forward to holding him to account. He has made many announcements with no clear indication of proposals for their implementation or any timescale. In spite of all the public announcements, press statements and so on, he has given no indication of whether he has any strategy in effective transport. I would like to hear his vision for public transport, including the railways. I am not sure  that there is any. It would be helpful for everyone if he made an opportunity for teasing out his thinking, if he has started to think about it at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">It is very important that a Minister for Transport has a very clear vision about what can be achieved in the sector of good quality public transport. The Minister should be clearly seen to be a strong advocate of the principle of reliable, efficient and safe countrywide transport systems. He should have ambition for the potential of public transport. To date there has been no evidence of this. That vision is definitely needed at the top level of decision making and also needed within the service providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Over many years there has been a distinct lack of vision within CIE companies. This was clearly influenced by political interference and inertia, but we now need Iarnród Éireann – formerly CIE – to develop a vision for the positive provision of public transport and recognise the enormous role played by public transport in terms of providing for sustainable development and adding significantly to the quality of people's lives. If the service providers are to take this kind of proactive, positive approach, there must be a very clear commitment from Government to provide for adequate and ongoing investment in order to secure the social good, which can be achieved through efficient public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Given the lack of vision for railways in recent decades, it is not surprising that the state of the railways went into such decline. The IRMS consultants' report on the 1997 derailment found that safety weaknesses were endemic in both the hardware and software of the railways. Furthermore, the consultants found a decaying infrastructure, loss of middle management who had any kind of knowledge of the system, relative lack of safety training, weak safety systems, low morale among the staff, poor communication systems and weak safety audits. To some extent, decision makers were seen to come to the conclusion that this situation could not be allowed to continue. Public concern about safety and the consultants' report, which highlighted graphically serious problems, forced a rethink in relation to investment in hardware and safety measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">In Iarnród Éireann we have seen that where the Government of the day was prepared to make a financial commitment to the company, it had the capacity to measure up to the confidence being placed in it. To be fair to management and staff in Iarnród Éireann, since money has become available for improvements in recent years there has been an extraordinary improvement in safety within the company. The IRMS report containing that damning assessment of safety was issued in 1998 and just a few years later in July 2001, the report of the Minister's review group on the railways, Iarnród Éireann – The Way Forward, found a drastic change in the culture within the company. It states, "There is a high level of safety consciousness and commitment to best safety practice in IE."  It recognised that the company had responded to the injection of funding in the  areas of hardware and software and went on to state:</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The Review Group was struck by the very frequent mention of safety, indicating a serious dedication to safety as the expressed number one core value of the company. Progress in developing a safety culture has been acknowledged by the IMRS safety report. We accept that safety has the highest priority with all levels of staff throughout the company. The recent staff attitude survey results confirm this view.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">There was a very dramatic change in the space of a few years when Government began to place confidence in the company and started to put its money where its mouth was. Obviously, more needs to be done, but once the investment programme started the company did respond positively and there have been major improvements in safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">It is generally accepted that the existing statutory framework for regulating rail safety is completely inadequate and outdated. The Bill proposes to address these inadequacies by introducing a modern framework. There has been much media and political interest in rail safety which tends to arise in the immediate aftermath of railway incidents or accidents. In addition, events over the past two years in the United Kingdom have raised general interest in rail safety. The railway accidents in 2000, 2001 and May 2002, which resulted in numerous fatalities, have had a major impact on the operation of railways in the United Kingdom and caused much political and organisational fallout. These events were widely reported in the media here, which helped to focus attention on this area. The general scheme of the Bill was subject to a public consultation process in the spring of last year, the responses to which indicated very little opposition to its general thrust and principles from most of the parties in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">I am concerned by the length of time it took to start the debate on this legislation, as the issue is so pressing. The Bill had its origins in the IRMS report on the derailment published in October 1998. Therefore, it is now four years since the recommendations on which the Bill is based were made. That four year delay seems extraordinary. The Bill was presented to the Dáil 12 months ago and, despite being on the Government's priority list, not taken during the last Dáil. The debate has now begun four years on. I hope the slow progress to date of the legislation is not repeated in its passage through the Oireachtas. The Minister will be given every co-operation to deal with it as speedily as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">The Bill puts in place a new regulatory framework for rail safety which will apply to all railways to which the public has access, including the Iarnród Éireann network, light rail, the metro and heritage railways. It will also apply to those aspects of industrial railways which have an interface with the public road or rail networks. Why are freight services not fully covered by the  Bill? As I do not understand the rationale for this, perhaps the Minister will outline the thinking behind it.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">The principal feature of the Bill is the setting up of the independent railway safety commission to regulate rail safety in Ireland. The new commission will have wide-ranging powers of inspection, enforcement and accident investigation. Placing the primary duty of care on railway undertakings to ensure the safety of persons in the operation of their railways is a key feature of the Bill. In order to comply with that duty of care, railway undertakings will be required to implement formal safety management systems and describe their systems in a document called, A Safety Case – the placing of a duty on all staff of railway companies and other persons carrying out an activity on or near a railway not to endanger people using the railway. Road authorities and railway undertakings will be required to consult each other in cases where new works by one party have safety implications for the operation of the other. The Bill also sets up a consultative body, the railway safety advisory council, the membership of which will be drawn from representatives of the railway industry, rail unions, the safety commission and other bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">While there is general support for the principles of this legislation, I have concerns about a number of areas to which I hope the Minister will respond. Regarding inquiries to be carried out by the commission and representation at them, the Bill provides for inquiries to be made into both incidents and accidents. In at least three sections there are provisions whereby admissions made in the course of an inquiry cannot be used in subsequent legal or other proceedings. This obviously indicates the complexity of the process concerned. However, there is no provision allowing for representation at inquiries. If that is the case, it weakens the process as denial of representation would obviously constitute an infringement of the right of citizens under the rules of natural justice. A provision or provisions allowing representation at inquiries would clearly strengthen the inquiry process. The Minister should outline his plans in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Regarding random intoxicant testing, rail workers have always operated in an environment of low tolerance for alcohol abuse. It is to everyone's credit that alcohol has not figured as a contributory factor in any rail accident in the last 30 years. It is generally accepted that there is a need to continue this strict regime and its adaptation to other drugs which, although illegal, are in widespread circulation. While the Bill sets out an approach, there are questions about its acceptability, given the provisions for random testing. It could be the case – I would like to hear the Minister's legal advice on this – that the provisions may be unconstitutional. The provisions in the Bill are arguably the result of advice from the IRMS which, while technically excellent in other respects, seems unable to cope with the different situation in this area caused by the Con stitution. Section 85 formalises what was already the case and provides for a regime similar to that applying to road users under the Road Traffic Acts. This similarity should be made explicit. Section 1 is rather tortuously worded and the role of unions envisaged in the section might best be made explicit. The Minister should consider this.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Section 87(<i>c</i>) provides for the administration of intoxicant tests at random. While I fully support the desired outcome, we cannot accept that railway workers should have a lesser level of basic rights than other citizens. Recent experience in the Supreme Court should show us that the basic constitutional rights of the citizen cannot be restricted, irrespective of how socially desirable the objective of the legislation is. There is no other group of workers to whom random intoxicant tests apply. If this is a change, there is no doubt that the constitutionality of the section will ultimately be tested by the Supreme Court. It would be helpful, therefore, if, on Committee Stage, the Minister could produce the legal advice from the Attorney General's office on the constitutionality of such random testing. It seems that if this were constitutionally permissible, the Attorney General's office would have sought to introduce an element of random testing in the Road Traffic Acts in order to curb the spread of drink driving. Clearly, there were constitutional obstacles to doing so; how are those obstacles to be overcome in relation to this legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The remit of the commission is set out very clearly in the legislation regarding tracks and embankments, the need to make all bridges and level crossings safe and so on. What is not clear is the extent to which it has a remit regarding overcrowding on trains. Anyone who has taken the Intercity train any time on a Friday is well aware of the sardine-like conditions on many of our train services which is a clear threat to public safety. I am not sure of the commission's remit in that regard. Also, what is its remit regarding the safety of those with a disability? Can it dictate policy to Iarnród Éireann or other companies regarding ticketing policy, the need to prebook or the need to make specific provision for those in wheelchairs? The Minister should tease this out.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">I am surprised the commission is not required to produce an annual report. Section 32 states it may produce a report to the Minister, but surely if one has such an important public body, it should be required to produce an annual or biannual report. There should be a clear legal requirement on it to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Regarding the railway safety council, it is a good idea to have a consultative group established, though I am concerned by the appointment system. It seems the Minister has the right to appoint every one of the 14 members. Most appointment procedures in recent years have recognised the need to ask different sectors to make nominations. The legislation states organisations representing those with disabilities may make a nomination and the Minister may have  regard to it, but he or she is not required to accept it. It is a mendacious way to do business; we should ask organisations to nominate rather than have the Minister hand-pick individuals which in the past has resulted in State bodies being packed with political lackeys who do not have any particular expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">There is provision for someone to represent the public interest, but there are two separate definitions of the public interest in this area. There is an overall public interest and also that of the travelling passenger. It is essential at least one person on the authority is a regular commuter. Often those in decision making positions, whether in the Department of Transport or among Members of the Oireachtas, rarely use public transport. It would be a good exercise if we were forced to use it on a regular basis. Perhaps the Minister for Finance will consider withdrawing or taxing the free parking facilities for Members, forcing us to use public transport and experience, as other members of the public do, the shortcomings and inadequacies of the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">There should be a limit to the term of office of members of the council. Initially they are appointed for a three year term, but a person can be reappointed time and again which is bad practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">I am concerned, in view of the slow movement of this legislation, about its commencement. We might pass the Bill, but commencement may not begin for some time after its passage. The Minister could leave it on the long finger which is unacceptable. There should be a time constraint for commencement of within three months of enactment of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The IRMS noted in its 2001 report that the delay in the provision of the mini-CTC signalling system on the Maynooth-Sligo, Athy-Waterford, Tralee-Banteer and Ballinasloe-Galway lines had a severe effect on the ability of Iarnród Éireann to maintain signalling on the affected routes. In the light of these conclusions the Minister commissioned the IRMS to review a high level strategy paper from Iarnród Éireann setting out a safety action plan pending implementation of the mini-CTC project. Its findings and the implications of the delay in the implementation of the mini-CTC project were published in August 2001. The response from the Government is still awaited. The Minister should comment on it now and make it available to those of us who would like to read it. There are clear implications for rail safety. The area requires urgent attention.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_368">
          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_702">I was musing today that it was only 160 days since I was elected and this would be my first opportunity to speak on a debate in the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward. I wish him well in his role and support his future efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">It might be surprising that a Deputy from the constituency of Dublin South West might want to speak on a Bill concerning the rail network when there are no trains that run to Tallaght. While I  was preparing my contribution, however, I was conscious that we had been lucky not to have experienced a major rail disaster on the scale of the incidents that have occurred in Britain. Three years ago, I was recovering from surgery during the week of a terrible train disaster in London. Because I had nothing else to do except rest, I spent a lot of time watching Sky News. It had an effect on me at the time because it was a very sad event and television can be intrusive when covering disasters of that nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">Reading the review of rail safety in Ireland, carried out on behalf of the old Department of Public Enterprise, I was dismayed to see the level of difficulty Iarnród Éireann had with safety on its rail network. I was also shocked to read that a year after the review, a follow up report confirmed that only a small number of previous safety issues had been resolved and that, in the meantime, further difficulties had been identified. With such a background, the introduction of this framework for rail safety is both urgent and overdue. We are aware of the investment in the rail network in recent years with the support of the national development plan and all know the shambles that is the signalling system was the subject of an inquiry by a committee of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">I welcome the establishment of the railway safety commission and the fact that its remit will cover the entire rail network, including the Luas system. The safety of that new network, given the more open access to the areas over which it travels, is essential. The public must also be made aware of their responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">I represent Dublin South West, which includes Tallaght, the third largest population centre in the State. I am glad that a large section of the Luas line is in my constituency, but want to restate my amazement that Luas, when it travels from the city centre to Tallaght, will terminate at The Square. Who made the decision to go no further than The Square and deny direct access to Luas to over 30,000 people in the Old Bawn and west Tallaght estates? Those Members who know west Tallaght are aware that there is not a high level of car ownership in the area. There are also many job opportunities further out in City West. There is, therefore, a demand for the line to go that far.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">When Luas comes to Tallaght, it will be of great benefit to the area and its people and I look forward to using it. Since I was elected I have travelled on occasion by bus from Tallaght, and while I hate having to use my car, that is what I mostly have to do. When Luas comes I look forward to coming into Heuston Station, going on to Connolly Station and walking to Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">In regard to the development of Luas, extending it in the future will be much more expensive than if it was done now. Many in Dublin South West – Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills and Templeogue – feel let down by the decision thus far with regard to extending it to Tallaght.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The provisions of the Bill are extensive and I intend to comment on just a few of them. In  regard to the make-up of the commission, I have no difficulty in supporting the appointment of up to three members. Using the specialist knowledge required, up to 12 years service, seems reasonable. Given that the current chief railway inspecting officer with the Department will be a commissioner, I hope the work of the commission, more importantly its results, will be more evident than the response by Íarnród Éireann to its requirements while within the Department. It is vital that the commission has the best talent available to it to carry out its work and, when establilshing the commission, the Minister briefs its members with the words, "Take no prisoners, peoples' lives are at stake."</p>
          <p eId="para_710">On the section which permits the commission to engage consultants and advisers, I recommend, where possible, that these experts be recruited as a last resort, not as an excuse to have a difficult decision sidetracked or as a substitute for internal abilities and expertise. Given the size of the rail market, I support the section on conflicts of interest and the declarations required. An area of potential future difficulty has been closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">I note that the Bill allows for a levy to be imposed on rail network operators and that this levy cannot be imposed before December 2004. The commission should be funded by rail operators and at a future date its costs and work level should become a sub-cost of the expenditure on safety made by operators of rail networks. For example, if a statutory percentage of total operators' income is to be spent on safety, then the levy should be part of this percentage. I welcome the fact that the commission will participate in the strategic management initiative process from day one with the publication of a statement and the use of the annual report to provide updates.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">I am aware of the need to include general duties of railway undertakings, staff and other persons in the Bill, particularly the section dealing with drugs or alcohol. While not wishing to engage in any industrial relations issues, I am speaking for many of my constituents when I say that for the safety of all of us we cannot allow operators lenient in this area to remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">I mentioned earlier – I was not being flippant – given that there is no train service in Tallaght or in my constituency, some might be surprised that people talk to me about rail safety. As Deputy Shortall mentioned, we all travel at one time or another, as do many of my constituents. Even though Tallaght is a great place, there are many other places in the country to which people travel by train and people do talk to us about safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">On the issue of safety management systems and the safety case, I read with great interest the areas covered by the relevant section, the aims of which I support. I express my future support for the commission should it ever – I hope it does not – find itself in the position of serving notice on an operator. That operators could find themselves unable to provide the public with a service would clearly be their fault and the commission  would act in the public interest. Some of the periods allowed for in responding to notices are too lenient. When a full notice has been issued, the operator should cease operations imediately and take its appeal to the courts to have the notice lifted, bearing in mind that peoples' lives are at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">What the public needs to see in rail safety is new rolling stock, not 40 or 50 passengers who have paid for their tickets sitting between carriages or hiking up two carriages to get to the platform. In the case of many DART and commuter services, passengers have to leave home earlier or work later to get into a carriage. While infrastructure is essential, rail safety must also encompass customer service. I look forward to reading the annual reports of the railway safety commission and hearing less complaints about the rail service. That is an ideal to which many Members would subscribe.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">In commending the Bill to the House I wish the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, well. I am sure he will be informed of the good wishes extended to him by Deputy Shortall and others. He has a difficult job to do. As he was a Dáil Deputy for parts of my constituency, I have known him and other colleagues for some time. He should be given the opportunity to do the job that many of us want him to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I had an unfortunate experience where I was late for a Dáil vote a few weeks ago. Given that there are only a few of us present, I will relate the story. It took me some time to recover because I recall the former Deputy, Mr. Chris Flood, whom I replaced, telling me that whatever else I do over the next five years, never be late for a vote. I was late. In fairness, there was a particularly bad problem with Dublin traffic that morning where the road from Tallaght, through Crumlin and into the Liberties, was blocked due to all sorts of natural happenings. It emphasises the challenge of the Department of Transport in relation to the Minister's remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">There will be much party politics after 7 p.m. which is fair enough, but at the end of the day we should encourage our Ministers. I am prepared to do so, but feel strongly about the challenge facing the Minister. Apart from party political difficulties, I hope he will have the goodwill of all Members as he tackles it. Let us have proper debate and criticism, when necessary, but let us also be supportive of the Minister as he attempts to tackle something that the public wants him to do, that is, solve the traffic problems, not only in Dublin and the major cities, but also throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I appreciate the opportunity I have been given to make these few comments on the Railway Safety Bill which I commend to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_369">
          <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_720">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this important Bill and remind Deputy O'Connor that Fine Gael enthusiastically welcomes it. While there are few issues that are  truly about life and death, this is one of them. The Fine Gael transport team is of the view that when it comes to public transport safety of passengers is of the utmost importance. Over the next few years as demands for transport infrastructure grow, safety will rank above all other considerations. It is no State secret that our rail infrastructure is crumbling. Our train services stand alone in Europe as underfunded, undervalued and undermined. Passengers have suffered as a result. While their comfort is important, their safety is pivotal to the future of the railways.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">On the train from Limerick this morning we were stopped for five to ten minutes at Inchicore because of works on the line. Earlier in the year in my neighbouring constituency of Limerick one of the more recent accidents in the rail system occurred. Sr. Joan Bowles was killed when her car was struck by a train at a railway crossing near Drumkeen, County Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The fourth progress report of the cross-departmental team on infrastructure stated in April that safety improvements had been made on 211 level crossings. It is clear, however, that these improvements did not prevent the awful occurrence in Drumkeen. The Minister must ensure such an accident is never allowed to happen again. To do this, proper funding, expertise and attention must be given to making Ireland's rail network world class in terms of safety as well as reliability.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Ireland is lucky that it has been spared the horrors of the rail network in Britain. We have not seen disasters like those that occurred at Selby, Paddington or Hatfield a number of years ago. Last week there was a rail disaster on the TGV in Nancy when 12 people were killed on a train service. We should be thankful that we have not had anything like this, given the state of our railways. The absence of a major disaster in Ireland should not detract from the fact that life and limb are being risked daily. That is the reason this Bill is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The last time the Bill was before the Dáil a number of weeks ago, the Minister alluded to the fact that in March 1999 the Government approved a four year plan and spending amounting to €546 million on a rail safety investment programme. Under the programme, 246 miles of track have been replaced with continuous welded rail track and 371 level crossings made safer or closed off. However, accidents such as the one in Limerick still occur. The sheer scale of what is needed to make our railways safe is obvious.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">From my own investigations in this matter it seems that part of the problem lies in the fact that designated railway crossings on railway lines are located at the most dangerous places. Iarnród Éireann has stated the Ennis to Limerick line, in my constituency, will be upgraded in 2003. Work is ongoing and there is only a mid-week bus service which transfers passengers from Ennis to Limerick. There are about 45 crossings for cattle farmers on that line alone, a large number of which are situated close to bends in the railway, denying the farmer a view of sufficient range to  protect himself or passengers on the train from the risk of disaster. How many times have animals strayed onto railway lines and been killed by oncoming trains? Given that this is allowed to continue on the railways of County Clare and throughout the country, it is incredible that we have not seen disasters in Ireland such as those that occurred at Selby, Paddington and Hatfield. The Bill, by putting in place a proper regulatory framework for rail safety, will make the possibility of accidents more remote.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The decline of the railways began in the 1940s when the road became king and huge chunks of the rail network were phased out and closed down. That was a reflection on Government policy at the time. This phenomenon has had a massive environmental impact on the country, particularly in terms of the lack of proper freight train systems on the Limerick, Ennis, Athenry, Galway and Sligo lines. There were once many freight trains carrying timber for the State, saving the State the consequences of 20 articulated trucks on the road clogging up traffic, tearing up tarmac and filling the air with exhaust fumes. Needless to say, those freight trains are not running today.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">Similarly, there are thousands of commuters who would like to take the train but simply cannot rely on it to get them to their destination on time. Think of all the congestion, the pollution caused by cars that a justified lack of confidence in our rail network causes. The Government needs to invest in the rail network. It needs to rid itself of the misconception that public transport is for ordinary people and that nobody would choose to travel by bus or train if they had a choice. However, if after five years of unprecedented growth due to the economic situation that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats inherited from Fine Gael, the Government has not put the targeted investment needed into our railways, I suppose we cannot expect it to do it at this stage. The Bill does allow us some hope because without a proper safety mechanism in place the expansion and improvement needed to restore our railways to greatness will not come.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">Let me turn to the proposed independent railway safety commission. It is amazing that such a commission has not been established before now. The Bill envisages that, among other matters, the commission will be independent in carrying out its functions. Fine Gael wholeheartedly welcomes this provision having seen how, in many other areas, the lack of independent scrutiny has led to an inability or unwillingness to find the truth. The commission is empowered to investigate rail accidents. While we hope it will never have to exercise this function, the Bill at least allows for the truth to be established quickly and fairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">It is a shocking indictment of Ireland's safety record that as late as 1998 International Risk Management Service which was commissioned to carry out a review of rail safety in Ireland  identified multiple examples of unreasonable risk requiring urgent remedial action by Iarnród Éireann. This is a national scandal and an admission that the lives of tens of thousands of rail users were put at risk. This is simply unacceptable. Not to have acted would have been not only inhuman but would also have made a joke of any policy designed to get people out of their cars and onto public transport. Added to the underfunded, poorly maintained, cramped image of our trains, it would have been a killer blow that they were not safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">It cannot be suggested that the full implementation of the various provisions of the Bill will mean no deaths or accidents on the railways. We can, however, hope it means fewer and that we can solemnly swear that in passing the Bill we have tried our best to limit the loss of life and limb. The Bill marks a turning point in the history of rail transport in Ireland. It establishes an onus on the State, through the commission, to ensure the safety of those coming in contact with the railways, and puts in place the regulatory framework necessary to ensure safety is of paramount concern. On a very basic level it will bring to an end the scandal of unsafe crossings, unsafe stretches of rail, and unsafe practices that pose a major threat to Ireland's rail users. As I stated, what we are talking about today is hypothetical, but we could so easily be discussing a major rail accident in which dozens had lost their lives. The lives of individuals have been lost on railway lines during the years. They may not lodge in our memories, but they do lodge in the memories of their dear ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The Bill also serves another purpose. Politicians are often accused of reacting rather than acting, of being led by events rather than dictating them, of following, not pioneering. As an elected representative for County Clare, I can go back to my constituency and tell anyone who accuses this House of this what happened here today. This may not attract column inches of newspaper coverage. In many ways it may not deserve it, but by passing the Bill, Dáil Éireann can say that in this instance it did not take a major disaster or a loss of life before we did something about our railways. It did not take outside pressure. Instead it took a little foresight, a little leadership on all sides of the House to pass these measures. When the history of the railway is written, it will be remembered that 2002 saw the foundations laid for expansion, for it was not only that safety was established on Ireland's rail network, but rather that the future of the railways was established. If we can tell our people that the trains in which they travel are safe, the battle to bring more people onto them can be won.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_734">It is always difficult to speak on a motion of no confidence when the motion relates to oneself and it is especially difficult for a man as modest as myself. Even when thoroughly deserved and well earned, self praise can always sound hollow. I welcome the wise comments and observations of my colleagues who have opposed this motion. Equally, I fully understand the political desperation which motivated those who have misguidedly supported it. The real political significance of this motion has nothing to do with the discharge of my functions as Minister for Finance and everything to do with the terminal decline of Fine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">I find it amusing to be at the receiving end of criticism over my alleged mathematical deficiencies from Deputies who have yet to comprehend the difference between being decimated and being halved. If Fine Gael had only been decimated in the last election, Deputy Noonan might still be leader and Deputy Kenny might have a prospect of achieving ministerial office at some point in the future. Instead, in an attempt to gain some name recognition east of Castlebar, Deputy Kenny is trying for a place in the Guinness Book of Records by being the first party leader to promote a vote of no confidence in a Minister before that Minister announces his budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">In my budget speech last year, I said that my first five budgets were the five chapters in my first book. I would love to stand here and read that  book for those opposite but time restrictions will not allow that. However, given that Christmas is quickly approaching, I will give the House a flavour of it and encourage the Members opposite to read it over the festive period, by which time I will have written the first chapter of my second book.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">Since 1997, I have introduced major reforms to the tax system which has seen it transformed and made more equitable and efficient; I established the National Pensions Reserve Fund to provide for future generations, a measure ahead of its time; I put in place and defended at EU level a business tax environment which has played a key role in our economic success; I have increased social transfers to levels that those in Opposition could not aspire to; and I have provided resources and support for the aged, children and the more vulnerable sections of our people, as the electorate recognised last May.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">These measures have ensured that Ireland has achieved one of the best economic performances in the world, economic growth has averaged nearly 10% per annum, unemployment has been reduced from over 10% to historically low levels, over 300,000 new jobs have been created and long-term unemployment has been cut by 80%.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste dealt comprehensively with the so-called "missing millions" last night and I do not intend to cover this ground again tonight. I would like, however, to ask some questions of my own. Does Fine Gael believe that it is a crime to give taxpayers back their own money and that this represents a squandering of public funds? Does it consider it an offence to share the fruits of growth with those on low incomes and those who have contributed so selflessly during their lifetime to the fortunate position we find ourselves in today? Does the Opposition wish the people to give the money back? What does the Opposition have to offer other than a notice to repay? I would love to hear the answers to these questions, assuming of course that the Opposition parties have answers which, if their respective election manifestos were anything to go by, I very much doubt.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">The Opposition have started this Dáil as they finished the last, not that anybody on this side of the House is surprised – they want to run with the hare and chase with the hounds. Having spent five years describing spending increases as inadequate and consistently condemning me as tight-fisted, they now assail me for spending too much. I still have to hear from them a single proposal to reduce any specific spending programme. The electorate saw through this last May and the Opposition now appears well on its way to repeating that drastic error.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">For some time now those opposite have had little constructive to offer other than to grumble that the electorate was misled. This allegation is a complete canard. I disposed of this false accusation point by point in the House on 9 October. I explained the chronology of forecasts during the year, the picture shown by early tax returns, the  advice offered to me, the full parliamentary replies I had given and the crucial assessment of 1 May 2002 that we were on course. I do not intend to repeat myself other than to say that no one was misled. Moreover, following my Department's response to Deputy Bruton's freedom of information request, those opposite know this to be case.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">Debt is an issue close not only to my heart but also to some of those parties opposite, though for very different reasons. I have always promoted the virtue of reducing our debt to a moderate and sustainable level and have presided over a reduction in the national debt, as a percentage of GDP, from 74% to 34%. As the Opposition has had so much practice in running up mountainous debt, it will appreciate the pitfalls in running it up to inappropriate levels. It knows in its heart that debt is not the solution. Borrowing can quickly use up resources. If any Minister for Finance failed to recognise this, he or she would indeed deserve a motion of no confidence, but I have done the opposite.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">In recognising the problem of debt not only for this generation but also for the next, I set up the National Pensions Reserve Fund to address this looming problem in good time. This action will help smooth the future Exchequer burden and it introduces a strategic focus into planning the budget. It had been my strong view, which I have stuck to firmly and taken criticism on, that we should not deploy the fund to meet short-term problems. To be fair, the former Fine Gael spokesperson, Mr. Jim Mitchell, supported this logic entirely and wanted to go further and reserve more.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The economic and budgetary picture facing us is very different from that in our first five years. The media seemed surprised when I said recently that the boom was over. I was merely confirming that economic growth had slowed markedly this year. The latest CSO data for the second quarter of 2002 shows a domestic economy expanding at about 2% when measured by GNP. This is less than our medium-term potential growth rate. The outlook for 2003 is not much different and the average growth rate for the period 2003-05 is likely to be in or around 3% and 4% in terms of GNP and GDP respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">For the 2003 budget, the first priority must be to ensure a sustainable rate of spending growth. Even so, the Government will continue to protect those on limited incomes. We have made clear progress in reducing consistent poverty to very low levels with increases in social welfare allowances significantly exceeding the rate of inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">It had always been my ambition to be Minister for Finance. I can sympathise with those who served as Opposition spokespersons on finance but never got the opportunity to be Minister. The spokespersons opposite will understand if I do not wish them success as it is my intention to continue as Minister for Finance and to guide the economy to the point where we have achieved  our objectives without undermining the stability of the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">This House can be confident that I will take the requisite action to secure a sustainable financial position. Evidence of this will be clear when the 2003 Abridged Estimates are published tomorrow. This House can be confident that my continued stewardship will enable us to secure sound economic growth, high levels of employment and further social progress while staying within a stable and sustainable budgetary framework. This House can be assured that the budget is in safe hands, as it has been for the past five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I am proud to have served as Minister for Finance in the previous Government and to have been reappointed in the first Government to be re-elected by the people in over 30 years. I know I have the confidence of the people, the ultimate decision makers, the confidence of Government and, as we shall see tonight, the confidence of this House. I commend the amended motion to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_373">
          <from>Mr. Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_749">I am pleased to support the amendment before the House affirming the confidence of the Members of Dáil Éireann in the Minister for Finance and in Government policies as endorsed by the electorate. I find the criticism by the Opposition of the management of the economy extraordinary. It goes back to the election campaign. It is important that we on the Government side reiterate, for the benefit of the Opposition and anyone else who did not notice during the election campaign in May, that the people fully understood the financial situation of the country last year and early this year. I am confident of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">When I canvassed in Laois-Offaly and others canvassed in their areas it was on the basis that the good financial times would not continue and that tougher times were ahead, and the public voted this Government back. The people felt that the Fianna Fáil and PD Government was the best choice to take charge of the economy in the difficult times ahead. The people knew that when they went out to vote and knew why they voted for us. They did not believe that the growth of expenditure and income tax receipts would continue for the next five years. They knew things had changed and voted us back on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Every main party in the House, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats, accepted the Department of Finance projections for the year ahead in regard to a budget deficit and that there would be a return to deficit spending in 2003 and 2004. That was in the manifestos.</p>

I will come back to the point that perhaps the party members never read  the manifesto. We should understand that the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party are proposing this motion because, for the first time in my memory, we had the extraordinary situation where the Opposition parties collectively lost a general election.</p>

Fine Gael lost the election campaign and disposed of its leader. We now have Deputy Kenny leading the party. The Labour Party likewise, having lost the election, disposed of its leader and Deputy Rabbitte is its new leader.

They complained all summer that we were engaged in a programme of cutbacks and they are here for the last week complaining we have been overspending. Which way is it? Are we being accused of cutbacks or overspending? Does the Opposition know the difference between the two? They are contradictory—</p>

Deputy Rabbitte spent the summer complaining about cutbacks yet came here last night and complained about overspending. It is well for the people that it is a Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government that is publishing the Book of Estimates tomorrow. If it was left to the Opposition it would not get past the second line as it does not know the difference between cutbacks and overspending. I look forward to hearing the Opposition approach to the Estimates tomorrow. One will say we are cutting back too much while the other will say we are spending too much. I would like to hear a single coherent voice from the Opposition as to a suggested level of increased expenditure. We have the job of managing the public finances and we will do that carefully. The Opposition better get used to the phrase we used dur ing the election – we have a lot done and we have more to do.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_767">I am delighted to be present to make clear that I believe the current Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is one of the foremost Ministers for Finance the State has ever had. His record on the management of the economy speaks for itself. Since 1997, about 300,000 new jobs have been created, unemployment has fallen dramatically, involuntary emigration is no longer an issue, tax rates have been cut substantially and social protection has been enhanced significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">As everyone knows our economic growth has slowed substantially recently. This has been largely the result of the slowdown in the international economy. The EU Commission's autumn forecasts published this morning underline the current difficulties in the international economy. Real GDP for the euro area as a whole is expected to average 0.8% this year. For the US, the Commission forecasts a real GDP growth rate of 2.3% this year. These low rates of economic growth have created significant problems for Ministers of Finance throughout the developed world. The European Commission estimates that a number of countries will have substantial general Government deficits this year. As a percentage of GDP, it estimates that Germany will have a 3.8% deficit, France a 2.7% deficit, Italy a 2.4% deficit and Portugal a 3.4% deficit. These figures contrast with the Department of Finance's estimated general Government deficit this year of about 0.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">The figures show how this Minister for Finance has effectively and successfully managed the public finances of a small, open economy in the middle of an economic downturn.</p>

          <p eId="para_771">This Government has always promoted the virtue of reducing our debt ratio and keeping it at a moderate and sustainable level. The national debt as a percentage of GDP has fallen from 74% to 34% since 1997, a drop of 40%.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">We all know that debt is not the easy road. We should remind ourselves that in 1987 the average worker had to hand over almost eight weeks pay in taxes to meet debt-service costs. Low budget deficits, and surpluses, cut this burden to just over two weeks pay for the average worker by 2001. That is a difference of six weeks pay. Meeting extra pension and health costs for us as we age will cost the next generation as much as 7% more of GNP than today. That is even after allowing for part prefunding of pensions and lower capital spending as a percentage of GNP in the future. A demand for more borrowing amounts to a call for improved services now for which tomorrow's taxpayers should pay.</p>

          <p eId="para_775">Any finance Minister who failed to recognise pitfalls would deserve a motion of no confidence. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, on the contrary, has taken early action on this front. He set up the national pensions reserve fund to address this problem in good time. This fund is a nest egg put aside for workers. The Government understands this and has stood firm in its belief that the fund should not be deployed to meet short-term problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">This Government has also, since 1997, significantly reformed the taxation system, particularly personal tax. All taxpayers have benefited substantially from the major tax reforms and tax reductions that have been implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_779">In conclusion, this Minister has created the conditions for the recent record levels of growth which generated large increases in employment, incomes and living standards for all.

          <p eId="para_784">In party political terms, I welcome Fine Gael's continued adherence to its pre-election belief that it is possible to simultaneously reduce taxation, increase spending and sustain the economy. While the main political party remains in that cul-de-sac, it does not pose an electoral threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">The people proved beyond doubt that they understand the economic realities. They elected a Government they believed would make prudent decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_788">She also pointed out that the PAYE income tax take has been reduced from 36% to 32% in the past five years, while at the same time the corporation tax take has increased from 11% to 15%. That is difficult for some people to accept when they have been claiming the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has achieved the opposite. In 1997 we had 11% unemployment whereas we now have 4%. At that time 90,000 people were among the long-term unemployed whereas that figure is now 22,000 or 1.2%. Almost 400,000 extra people are at work who would otherwise be a drain on the resources of the State were they not employed.</p>

Some 80% of what we produce must be exported and sold on those markets. Tax reforms have played a huge part in encouraging investment and enterprise and creating employment. They have also made  Ireland the most attractive EU state from the perspective of foreign investors.</p>

Do they want tax rates hiked up to where they were five years ago? Are workers not entitled to a decent return for their efforts? Will the Opposition parties cut child benefit which has trebled in the past five years? Do they want to introduce taxation policies which will drive investment away from the country, accelerate the rate of job losses and stymie attempts to entice new employment to the country?</p>
          <p eId="para_796">We are comfortably meeting our commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact. Many of our European neighbours and partners would wish they were doing as well. We have a positive ratio of current expenditure to tax take. There has been a massive improvement in the national debt. We have a gross domestic product deficit of 0.5%, which is a sixth of that of some of our European partners. I have no doubt we will continue with capital investment for strategic infrastructure.</p>

          <p eId="para_831">There is one area in which I pay a warm tribute to the Minister for Finance and for which he can take credit. Successive Governments did not treat people with disabilities adequately and that is an indictment of them. The Minister for Finance was the first with that portfolio to make a quantum  leap forward in the level of funding allocated to people with disability. My predecessor, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance put together a three year programme and I oversaw two years of it.</p>

They cannot use the excuse that the resources are there now and were not there then because it could have been done before the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, arrived. He did it and he deserves the credit for it. It is one of the powerful reasons this House should endorse him as Minister for Finance and vote confidence in him to move forward and manage the Irish economy with the kind of backbone and strength of character he possesses, which so many on the other side of the House lack.</p>

          <p eId="para_838">It is not my intention to praise the Minister with faint criticism. Part of his perceived success as Minister is that many who are meant to oppose him are perceived in the public mind as unlikely to have done anything different. Some of those people might even have begrudging admiration for what he does and how he does it. I am not one of those people and my party does not consist of members of his fan club.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The Minister has presented a front of self-confidence, independent behaviour and ability, when in reality it has been a mixture of diffidence and arrogance to those who portray a different vision of the type of society we have and the type of economic justice we can achieve in this society. The Minister has been responsible for presiding over an Ireland that has become more economically wealthy but has lost its sense of well-being. It is an Ireland that has become more competitive and individualistic but has lost its sense of community. This is an Ireland that has been developed by the economic policies of the Minister fir Finance and the economic and social poli cies of the Government. It is an Ireland that has lost its way and lost touch. Even by the economic indicators in which so much faith has been placed, it is an Ireland that is losing its way even in terms of conventional economic measurements.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The Minister has been responsible for policies that have seen those on incomes of €50,000 per year and more gain at a price of €243 per week, or €12,000 per year, over those depending on social welfare. This is Robin Hood in reverse. This is the type of Ireland we have because of the Minister for Finance and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Instead of reacting to criticism, the Minister has chosen to pad it off. When that criticism comes from domestic political sources, that may be understandable, but when it comes from organisations responsible for informing the Government, such as the National Economic and Social Council, through its strategy document in 2000, which was largely ignored by the Minister, or the ERSI, which in many bulletins pointed to a different economic vision that the Minister chose to ignore, it is a different matter, but that is his prerogative. When the criticism is made by international organisations, we have to be concerned that the Minister has chosen to portray Ireland in a way that has not been to our general or economic benefit internationally. I am referring to criticism the Minister received only this year. The OECD in April 2002 chided the Minister for producing a budget that was inappropriately large in terms of its deficit and suggested weakness in terms of the budgetary system. That was the budget the Minister produced in this House last year and will have to seek to correct in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">When similar criticism was made by the European Central Bank, the Minister sought to make political capital from it, but that is the way of the Minister and the Government. Criticism from whatever source has to be turned into some type of competitive slogan that ignores the reality of the criticisms being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The Minister has served his time in this Government when the ideas he pursued doggedly and ideologically have worked, because of circumstances, for part of that time. However, the circumstances that pertain now in terms of the global economy have no place for his trickle-down economics or his "poor dragging themselves up by their bootstraps" economics. We need an economic strategy that involves all the people in a socially just and economically fair way and we need to have confidence in those who create and promote our economic strategy. This is the Ireland which the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, helped to create and which the Government helps to sustain.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">I wholeheartedly support this motion of no confidence and my party fully endorses it. In the words of the British MP, Leo Amery, speaking in the British House of Commons to Neville Chamberlain at the outset of the Second World War: "In the name of God, go."</p>

          <p eId="para_847">They can boast of one achievement that exceeds all others about which they boast. They have pulled off what must rank as one of the greatest confidence tricks in the history of elections, not only in this country but universally. The Tánaiste's party, the Progressive Democrats, increased its representation in the Dáil on the basis of a campaign that convinced sections of middle class Ireland that it was needed for another five years as the watchdog of Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">I looked at Ted Nealon's guide, launched this evening, and I saw a great photograph of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, up the pole ensuring that people get the message and that he put the frighteners on them, which was his intent in the first place, about the dangers of one-party Government. The party concerned was of course the one and only Fianna Fáil with which his party has so anxiously and willingly gone back into Government. Indeed the people have every right to be afraid of one-party Government if that party is Fianna Fáil, but they have as much right to continue to be afraid if it comprises Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">With the Minister for Finance, the other half of the double act was the Taoiseach – what a team. Those words of the Minister for Finance are now etched into Irish political history. On 13 May 2002, four days before the general election, he said: "I can confirm there are no significant overruns and no cutbacks whatsoever are being planned secretly or otherwise."  We are expected to believe that after the general election the real state of public finances suddenly struck the Minister and his Department like a bolt from the blue. We are supposed to accept that proposals for €900 million in public spending cutbacks were being prepared in his office, without the knowledge of the Minister. The now infamous Department of Finance memorandum dated June 2002, which must have been at an advanced stage of preparation if not complete before the general election, is also something of which people are now well aware and it will probably end up on school curricula at some time. If none of this deception had happened, the Minister would still not deserve a vote of confidence. The policies he has implemented over the past five years have widened the gap between the wealthy and the deprived in our society.</p>

          <p eId="para_851">This is truly a tragedy because the last Government had two enormous advantages it enjoyed over any previous Government in the history of the State. It was in office at a time of exceptional prosperity, resulting in budget surpluses in four successive years. Despite its slim Dáil majority and the crutch of the four musketeers, over the past five years it was able to plan for five budgets in a row. Those advantages were scandalously squandered by the Government and especially by the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">Not only did he and his colleagues fail to tackle the structural inequalities which warp our economy and damage our society, they actually worsened them and widened the gap between rich and poor.

          <p eId="para_855">In case the Minister has forgotten his bed time reading, I will recap. In our first submission we stated that there was never a more favourable economic climate in which to cultivate equity and to share prosperity. The Minister will not read it and now he will not even listen – it is no wonder he has got it all wrong. The Minister for Finance began his term in office by giving record tax cuts to the highest earners and big business and he repeated the exercise in each of his subsequent budgets. True.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">In 1998, we urged that the budget should dramatically improve the quality and quantity of services provided by the State in health, education, housing, social welfare, infrastructure and employment creation. The budget of 1999 led us to state that improved conditions for many sections of our society and the conspicuous luxury enjoyed by a minority contrasted sharply with the plight of those who have not been allowed to benefit. That is the reality people have faced under this Minister's stewardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">In the budget 2000, three times more money was spent on tax reduction than on social welfare increases. In budget 2001, there was a further reduction of 2% in the top rate of tax and, again, those who needed it least benefited most from the tax cuts. It has been estimated that the gap in disposable income between a person earning £40,000 per annum and a person who was unemployed widened by a full £159 per week.</p>

After four Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats budgets, the ESRI stated in  July 2001 that the high rate of relative income poverty is a serious structural problem that needed to be tackled while the resources were available. I would like to have said more but, undoubtedly, I will join colleagues in voting no confidence in the Minister for Finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_860">Before we get into the nitty-gritty of the debate, I wish to address what the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, said about the amount of money directed towards people with disabilities. According to recent figures, 1,711 people with intellectual disabilities are in need of residential services, 861 need day care services and 462 are without any service. Last night the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, spoke about the reduction in the number of unemployed to 4.4% but the reality is that for disabled people unemployment is 70%. Is that the Celtic tiger?</p>
          <p eId="para_861">I support the motion before the House. It is about confidence in the Minister for Finance and particularly the way he has mismanaged the public finances over an extended period. The debate is about the public finances and not the economic boom. The bottom line is that the Minister did not do the right thing at the right time. I blame the Cabinet too because, as a group, it must take responsibility. I am not looking for a head on a plate on the serious issue of our public finances but rather accountability from the elected members of this Government. They have failed to manage our finances and the public is losing confidence and demanding leadership and good practice in managing our money. Let us remind ourselves that, as taxpayers, it is our money.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">In the past seven years, we had the opportunity to end the housing crisis, to create services for the disabled and to do something about poverty in society, but the Cabinet blew it. The Government gave tax cuts to the well-off and walked away from providing services and taking the tough decisions in the interests of ordinary people. It squandered the boom and there is no way of walking away from that fact because it is a sad reality for many families. The Minister's leadership regarding our finances was not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">Of course, we must be responsible and manage our finances properly, but this is not just an economy but a country and a society, despite what some may think. We must be creative with our accounting and make sure everyone gets their fair share of tax. This is not happening at the moment. The Government writes off uncollected tax each year. In 2000, the total was €103 million; in 2001 it was €140 million and between 1997 and 2001, €987 million of tax debt was written off by the Revenue Commissioners according to its own figures. These are conservative figures but they show from where finances could be obtained to prevent cuts in public expenditure. They also show that tough decisions are not being made and that the Government is taking the easy option of cutbacks, thereby making ordinary people pay for  the mismanagement of the public finances. I urge the House to support the motion.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_864">Speaking as a Socialist Party Deputy, I have no confidence in this Minister for Finance. Over five years, he has transferred enormous wealth from working people to the very wealthy, big business and the major corporations. When he announced the budget last year, at a stroke he gave €329 million to big corporations in tax cuts, a further €347 million in reductions of employer's PRSI contributions. That is a massive €676 million in one year at a time when big business could not believe the profits it was raking in. The Minister intends to further reduce corporation tax to 12.5% – a further €300 million to €400 million in this budget. That means he is giving €1,000 million per annum to the minority business sector while 200,000 hard pressed working people will not have medical cards extended to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, yesterday proclaimed the Minister for Finance as her rock. It is no wonder because they have a long history of ideological bonding as well as bonding with big business with whose philosophies they are saturated. These are the Minister's policies. One can imagine the tone of the economic policies they discussed when they shared millionaire tycoon McElvaddy's sumptuous villa on a jaunt to the south of France a few years ago. Over the beef bourguignon and fine Côte de Nuit burgundy, one can be sure they were not talking about shifting the burden of taxation from working people to the super rich or closing down the disgraceful rules by which multi-millionaire citizens of this State seek refuge in tax havens abroad so they do not pay their fair share.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">During yesterday's Question Time, the Taoiseach hypothetically said that perhaps one could take the view that the whole capitalist system was finished. I wish it was and the sooner the better because it will get rid of this Government and this Minister and allow a society to develop for the benefit of ordinary working people.</p>

Balanced regional development will never happen under the current national development plan unless the Minister takes immediate action  in the mid-term review or in the spatial strategy. I have no confidence in a Minister who was unable to achieve a fundamental objective of his own plan in terms of balanced regional development.</p>

Unfortunately, it is also not a crime to deceive the people, despite the fact that it is morally wrong. I will point out to the Minister how people were deceived in recent months, particularly in the run up to the general election. On 13 May 2002, a few days before the election, the Minister wrote to the leader of Fine Gael as follows: "I can confirm that there are no significant overruns projected and no cutbacks whatever are being planned, secretly or otherwise."</p>

          <p eId="para_876">In relation to revenue, I am sure you will also welcome the recent strong rebound of our economy from the effects of the global downturn. In terms of employment, industrial activity and so on, all the key indicators have recently improved considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">That was last May. Very shortly afterwards, with the ink scarcely dry on the Minister's letter, the cost of a visit to a hospital casualty department has increased by 26%, VHI charges are up 18% and ESB charges are about 10% higher. College registration fees for students are up by 69% and the drugs refund scheme costs 22% extra. This is despite the Minister's statement that there would be no changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">I also wish to refer to a further deception. Last April, in the run up to the election, the Department of Education and Science set up websites with information on the status of various schools building projects. One such website carried the heading, "Major primary school projects approved to go to tender". In anybody's understanding, if a project is approved to go to tender, that indicates that prices will be obtained and a decision will be made as to whether the project is to go ahead. There were 30 primary school projects listed and, in all of the areas concerned, letters were circulated by Fianna Fáil candidates stating that the projects had been approved and  everything was in order. However, in reply to a parliamentary question on 5 November, I was informed that, of the 30 projects listed last April, only 17 have gone to tender and only six have actually commenced construction. Is that not deception?</p>
          <p eId="para_879">Lest the Minister might be under the impression that we are the only ones saying he deceived the public, I will quote from the opinion column in <i>The Irish Times </i>of 12 November which stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The coalition Government's response to the publication of a highly sensitive memorandum from the Department of Finance, calling for a reduction of €900,000 in spending on existing services in the coming budget, was pathetic. Rather than apologise to voters for misleading them at election time or considering whether ministerial resignations were in order, the Government chose to embark on a hunt for the individual who had issued the damning material.</p>

          <p eId="para_881">The circumstances which gave rise to the Fine Gael motion are quite different to what the Taoiseach outlined in his speech last night. The present situation would not have arisen if the economic boom had been managed properly and if the Minister for Finance had the foresight to realise that the good times would not just keep on rolling. I am referring to proper management, not simply cooking the books. The standard media presentation by the Government is to give a litany of the expenditure on various programmes. Nobody is questioning ability to spend. The real issue is value for money, something we have not had from this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">Some of those on the Government side who supported the Minister tonight were those who were most vocal in their criticism two months ago, before his trip to County Kerry. At that time, they complained of how little information they were getting from the Minister for Finance. Now, they are congratulating him on the work he has done. Deputy Bruton referred to the hangover from which the country is suffering as a result of the Minister's spending splurge. There is little to show for it and we are back to belt-tightening times. The Minister should consider the people who will be most affected in this. At least 100 of our schools are still substandard, with rat infestation and antiquated toilet facilities. The Minister should visit some of those places to appreciate how little has been achieved. School managements seeking approval to go to tender are being slowed down and put on hold. I have been informed today of what is, in effect, a cut in the capitation grant, which will no longer keep in line with inflation. That is another backward step for which the Minister is responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">This Government has allowed €30 million to be spent in the last year on employing substitute supervisors in secondary schools. That is a total waste of money, as a result of which the Minister for Education and Science has had to cut back  significantly on programmes and increase charges. He has cut back €36 million from initiatives planned to help those most vulnerable in society, including €6 million to reduce the school drop-out rate, €5 million to attract socio-economically disadvantaged school leavers into third level education and €3.8 million from adult education programmes. When the Minister for Finance demanded savings, the Minister for Education and Science responded by taking out his scissors and cutting. Value for money was irrelevant. The 69% increase in third level registration fees hits the same families again, due to the ineffectiveness of this Minister, who has spectacularly failed to realise the importance of our young people. He has failed to recognise the return which investment in our young people can bring to the economy in future years. I believe the Minister for Education and Science, as a result of pressure from the Minister for Finance, is actively contemplating the reintroduction of third level college fees. In the House last night, the Tánaiste gave her rendition of "Stand by your man" in supporting the Minister for Finance, whereas before the Nice referendum she spoke vociferously against the reintroduction of third level fees. I hope she and her party colleagues will continue to ensure that does not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">Due to the incompetence of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, is about to set a new record. In his previous term as Minister for the Environment and Local Government, his achievement was to put house prices out of the reach of many people. He now looks set to put education equally out of reach of many people. The Minister for Finance asked why this motion was brought forward before the budget. He appears to be anticipating another motion of confidence in him in three or four weeks time.</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_885">Fianna Fáil claimed a unique selling point in the general election last May, namely economic competence. Voters were led to believe that Fianna Fáil could handle the economy best. A party with a commanding lead on economic management is usually electorally unbeatable. However, there is no free lunch in developing and sustaining such a lead. It comes at a cost and, when lost, remains so for a very long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">Ten years ago John Major trounced Labour in Britain because of economic competence. On black Wednesday, five short months later, he lost it completely in just one day. His party has not recovered from that loss of belief in its capacity to run the economy. Comparisons can be deceptive but I suspect the Minister for Finance has caught the Norman Lamont bug and no amount of medicine will cure the infection. His sunny smile coaxed us to party through the boom and ignore the Cassandras who warned of the inevitable hangover and the social downside of his policy. It was fine then, but it is not so fine now. No way is he now the Minister for Finance who can  candidly face the truth and set in reverse the policies that brought him fame but are now inappropriate to the new economic realities.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">One of these new economic realities emerged only last evening from the World Economic Forum which downgraded Ireland's competitiveness in the international competitiveness league from 11th to 24th place. The mask of economic competence is slipping very rapidly indeed and that fact was paraded before the whole world. Every year during the boom the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance could bask in the glow of international reports such as this which boosted Ireland's international ratings. If they took the kudos then they must take the rap now for our falling positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">Equally disturbing is the revenue shortfall exposed in recent Exchequer returns. Tax receipts under most headings are way down. Some of this is due to reduced overtime and fewer bonuses but one alarming feature is the tax agenda of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. The pride and joy of the McCreevy reign in Merrion Street is the elaborate framework of tax shelters he has purposely created, year in and year out, to enable a reduction, or indeed elimination, of tax for the very rich people. If tax shelters are created it must follow, as night follows day, that tax revenue from this well-to-do sector will fall dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">The impact of the ill-judged special savings scheme exacerbates this. Whatever its merits, it is inexcusable that the cost estimates were so totally off the mark. This is no simple error of calculation, unforgivable though that would be, it is an error of judgment which on its own deserves the sanction of the loss of office.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">For five years the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, had a golden economy and his leader's remarkable personal authority. He could have moved mountains, but he barely managed to move a molehill. Look at the turnabout so far on the national development plan. This was the flagship of the Government for the past six years. The flag looks rather frayed and shabby now and the ship is barely above the water line. There is not a single heading in the plan where significant progress can be reported and many projects, such as the Dublin metro, are effectively in the bin. More will follow tomorrow. Cost overruns and woeful project management have resulted in a roads programme which is in serious disarray. The same applies to public transport and investment in a central communications infrastructure. The World Economic Forum reported last night that our communications infrastructure has fallen to No. 31 in the world league. We have fallen behind Northern Ireland and parts of eastern China.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">This failure to deliver on targets will destroy, and deserves to destroy, the Minister's reputation for competence. He, more than any other Minister, oversees the national development plan. When faced with funding difficulties in his current spending he simply chose to raid the surplus,  which was earmarked for capital spending, to cover his blushes and hide the evidence of economic mismanagement. Rather than face the music for allowing a deficit he simply let the capital programme run behind and endure intentionally created delays so that the surplus could be diverted into a reckless, politically motivated spending binge on headline-making tax cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">This was always the case with Fianna Fáil, but unfortunately the country will pay dearly for the mismanagement of capital plans and use of cutbacks on capital as the easy route to a balanced budget. Predecessors of the Minister have ensured that the intersections on the Naas Road, the M50 and Blanchardstown were built to a poor and shabby design. It will cost a fortune to rectify them. That is the standard of management the Minister has brought to the economy. Shoddy decisions with huge costs to be paid in the future by Irish workers. The stunning part of this is the breathless U-turn which the Minister made from the days when he starred as the tormentor of the squire of Kinsealy. We remember it well. How that old fox must smile into his champagne cup as he sees the saint of fiscal rectitude stray from the holy path into the same kind of temptation for which he was notorious and for which the Minister castigated his former leader. Not since St. Paul on the road to Damascus has there been such a conversion from fiscal rectitude to total recklessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is a professional accountant. He knows the rules and he knows what false accounting means. He has presented accounts which do not present a true and fair view of the economy. No conscientious board of a private company would tolerate what has been foisted on the people. The only people who would tolerate it are those caught up in a spiral of false accounting like Enron or WorldCom. They cover up their losses by one device or other, leaving a false picture of the true state of the financial affairs they managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">The Minister can hardly be proud when he surveys the country that he could have shaped but did not. Few finance Ministers had the numbers to put their individual stamp on the face of the country. The Minister should eat his heart out. He had the chance to leave a stunning legacy and he has blown it. In years to come voters will look back in anger at the lost opportunities, the reckless spending and the rash tax cuts for the better off.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">The Minister has stayed too long in the job. He can do no possible good by staying on now. If his party and leader let him stay it will tell a revealing tale of their true beliefs. For the sake of the country the Minister should call it a day.</p>

          <p eId="para_900">What really rankles Fine Gael? Is it the massive growth he has inspired in the economy since his term of office – almost 10% per annum. Is it that he has effectively wiped out unemployment? Is it that he has put more money in people's pockets? Is that what rankles them? Is it that we are now one of the strongest rather than one of the weaker economies in the European Union? Is it that we are one of the favourite locations in the EU for foreign investment? Is it that we are still the fastest growing economy in the European Union? Is it the Minister's approach, which has enabled us to eliminate emigration and now enjoy net immigration?</p>

In his speech, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, said that Fine Gael is trying to establish a record by putting down a motion of no confidence before the budget has been issued. This motion, however, relates to the Minister's mismanagement of the public finances during his tenure as Minister for Finance since 1997, particularly in the past two years. When the people judge the Minister's budget in four weeks time, it may not be necessary to put down a motion of no confidence as their verdict will be clear. It is not true to say that we are looking to set a record by putting down this motion before the Minister delivers his sixth budget, as this motion relates to the past two years. The story of the missing billions is one of the greatest mysteries since the world was asking who shot J.R.</p>

          <p eId="para_1007">The workers of Ireland handed the Government a surplus of €4.8 billion, but, true to Fianna Fáil form, it was taken care of. The Government took care of it by handing the people a deficit which, as I speak, is rising to €1 billion. The hard-pressed workers of Ireland, 300 of whom were outside this House today and thousands of whom are doing the most important job of all by rearing children, are saying, "Thanks a lot, big fella" to the rock, Deputy McCreevy. The rock has been found out in recent times as his attempt to do the national equivalent of paying  off the overdraft by putting it on the gold card has come back to haunt him.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">The Minister's dire need to extricate himself from the awful financial quagmire we face dawned on him long before it became apparent to everyone. As soon as he came back into office, he instigated a survival plan. He knew he had been discovered and that someone would have to pay. It became a simple matter of choosing a victim, so he decided, as a start, to napalm the public services. Some €36 million was taken from education schemes devised specifically for disadvantaged children and 800 jobs in the health sector were lost. National road projects worth a cool €2 billion were scrapped and overseas aid was cut by €40 million. The Minister was playing it safe in the latter instance, as it is highly unlikely that the world's most destitute people, such as women who walk for hours each day to get water for their children, will ever be asked to endorse Fianna Fáil. Local authorities have been told that if they want to provide social housing, they will have to build the houses themselves. There is no room at the inn for the estimated 100,000 people on housing waiting lists.</p>

          <p eId="para_1014">Some €20 million has been removed from the fund to provide broadband technology, which is the lifeline to the BMW region and the electronic linchpin of the spatial strategy. The cost of a visit to accident and emergency wards has increased by 40% and VHI charges have gone up by 18%, after a previous rise of 9%. ESB charges have increased by an average of 10% and an extra 69% has been added to college registration fees. The threshold for the drugs refund scheme went up by 22%. We have the highest inflation rate in the European Union. The Minister is now extending these slash and burn tactics with the imprimatur, as opposed to the tacit approval, of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. The Government has decided that it can wring a bit more life from our most vulnerable citizens – the old, the sick and our children. These people are, ironically, those to whom the Minister for Finance owes a critical and constitutionally important duty of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">Coldly, the most fragile people have been selected for special treatment because they are being driven relentlessly and mercilessly into the economic killing fields. Leaving massive cuts in the public service aside – those I mentioned are just the opening salvo – Government spending is now running at €1 billion ahead of budget day targets. At the same time tax revenues are €1 billion below target. As I said earlier this week, even the manager of the local Christmas club could understand that. In pure economic terms, this represents a swing of €2.3 billion. If this continues, based on the Minister's own figures, we face a budget deficit of more than €5 billion in 2003, rising to more than €6 billion in 2004. All of that assumes that by some unique fiscal miracle the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will stick to his spending target for those two years. That is hardly likely when one considers his terrifying grasp of accounting procedures. Spending growth is rising at more than 20% each year. He has abdicated his responsibility by demonstrating beyond doubt that neither he, his Department, nor his Government have the remotest notion of what these tax concessions have cost. However, he actually believes that spending, which has been running at 20% for ten months, will nose dive to 6% for November and December. Is this real? Is this competency? Is this confidence?</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">On a Friday night some time ago on "The Late Late Show", the Minister chose to deliver a bizarre state of the nation address. He brazened out the oral indignation of the audience to announce that tax revenues would be €500 million below target. A week later he told a press conference that he would revise that figure upwards to €750 million. Two weeks later we discovered by a mistake, a <i>felix culpa</i> in the Department of Foreign Affairs, that we had left behind the realm of missing millions. This time we were going the whole hog –€1.3 billion. Our Minister for Finance, an tAire Airgeadais agus gach uile a bhaineann le sin – with all its connotations in our native language of duty, care, minding and responsibility, lost the country €1 billion in October alone. That is €250 million a week. Now the people will have to make it up. The Government did a runner with the public purse but the citizens must pay.</p>

          <p eId="para_1018">On budget day the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will prescribe a lash of nettle tea, sackcloth and ashes, hair shirts and tight belts. His new year message will be to "abandon hope all ye who enter here". One thing is for certain, the financial agony devised and now inflicted by the Minister will not abate. The Taoiseach said this evening that the 200,000 people who were  due to get medical cards will not now get them. The people will pay an exorbitant price for this uncharacteristic fit of fiscal rectitude. If the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, were the financial controller of a private company he would be gone long since to "pursue other interests". As "Catch 22's" Joseph Heller put it, "If I'm going to be trivial, inconsequential and deceitful, I might as well be in Government."</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1020">For Fine Gael, public business is always the most important business. The management of the public finances is always critical. The Estimates to be produced tomorrow are equally so. The budget just three weeks away will be the most critical in over a decade and consequently it deserves serious debate. I regret, however, that it will probably not get it. In fact, the shallowness and crassness of the Government was amply illustrated by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste last night. The Taoiseach said that health spending has risen by 134% since 1997. He said the numbers working in the health service were up by 22,000 in the same five years. He proudly announced the numbers of extra nurses and consultant doctors at 6,150. Less than one-third of those jobs were for front line medical personnel. Bureaucracy devoured the rest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">The Tánaiste said last night that so far this year we have granted as many work permits as we did for the whole of last year. That, she said, does not indicate an economy in crisis or difficulty. I agree absolutely with her. What it indicates, however, in health terms is an unreformed health service in deep crisis. The very fact that so many of these permits are for doctors and nurses from overseas shows the Government's spectacular success at making a career in medicine in this country a singularly unattractive option. It is now a ramshackle, disappointing, deeply frustrating prospect for so many of our best and brightest people who care and who genuinely want to contribute to the society in which we live. Publicly and here in this House, the Government has waxed lyrical about a renewal of politics. A good place to start would be for the Government to show some moral leadership and a good place to start giving moral leadership would be to have an open discussion about the state of the public finances. Let everyone have the facts transparently because a cut could then be a cut, not an adjustment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Since the Government took office, it spurned every opportunity for serious debate and analysis of the outlook for the public finances. It is in confronting problems that we begin to solve them. There is no sign of the Government even admitting to the problem, never mind confronting it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1024">As I speak, the 2003 Estimates round is being completed and will be published tomorrow. Critical decisions are about to be taken about public finances and the capital programme. These decisions, which will affect every citizen and will have an impact on the competitiveness of the economy and on every business and household, were taken in a vacuum without any public debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">Serious discussions to formulate a new partnership agreement have begun, an agreement which will incorporate the recommendations of the benchmarking body. This partnership agreement will have a powerful and enduring effect on our economy. After all public sector pay accounts for half of Government spending. Without an understanding of the current state of the public finances, how can there be constructive suggestions or constructive commentary that will inform debate on this critical agreement? I am demanding in the name of the people honesty in the Estimates. There must be no more monkey business. I do not want dodgy accounting pretending that public spending is not quite as bad as we all know it to be. I do not want capital spending hidden away in the National Development Finance Agency. I do not want dodgy transfers from the social insurance fund, Central Bank, capital services redemption account or the NTMA. I do not want to find that the Minister is deferring EU budget contributions to next year or that spending normally for 2002 will be transferred to 2003. I do not want apparent increases in health spending to prove illusory because health boards are already at maximum overdraft limits. I want evidence of real reform, the kind that gives us confidence, that an increase of 8% in the Estimates volume will not become 19% by 2003, as happened this year and last year. I want to see value for money. I want proper management of the public finances. I want a fiscal responsibility Act introduced which will mean that each Minister will comply with his or her budget and that no over-spending will occur unless specifically authorised by Cabinet. If the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is not part of the solution, then he is very much part of the problem. The state of the economy is a serious business. If there are problems, pretending they do not exist or that they will somehow go away is a route we have travelled in the past, with woeful consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">Neither I, my party, this side of the House nor all the Opposition Members have any confidence that the Minister for Finance will address these problems or, at the very least, recognise they exist. We are not yet in economic crisis. However, as night follows day, we will have a crisis if the Government does not confront it, analyse it and begin to solve it now. In the words of Henry Kissinger, "An issue ignored is a crisis ensured".</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">These days, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, arouses a lot of public feelings – everything except trust. But those who say there is no friendship at the top are wrong. The Taoiseach and Tánaiste, neither of whom are here, are standing firmly by their man, their rock. As we have seen to our cost, to have the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach turn on the remaining member of their triumvirate would be about as likely as <i>L'Osservatorio Romano</i> turning on the Pope. The Minister has diminished competitiveness and destroyed confi dence. He has shown complete ineptitude and exposed thousands of working families to the threat of economic ruin in the times ahead. This problem is the Minister's and it is of his making. It must now be of his fixing. He has proved undeserving of public and political confidence. His democracy is simply opportunism, therefore, he must go. If he had any sense, he would go. I hope he will.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1040">Farmers received a letter two weeks ago about de-stocking and those in rural areas are devastated by it. We knew there would be de-stocking but we did not expect the amount by which farmers would have to de-stock. A year ago, during the culled ewe scheme, farmers de-stocked and they thought when it came around on this occasion it would not be as severe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">The Minister has taken away a major source of income from western rural areas. If such income was lost in an industry, there would be uproar and a task force of some sort would be set up. We have taken money from farmers' pockets. I have heard of case after case concerning this issue. I met one client whose stock has been reduced to one ewe while another lady had a quota of 30 but was de-stocked by 33 sheep. She is now getting something back because we were told that no farmer should be de-stocked by more than 50%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">Those with green land and commonage are feeling the effect on their commonage. We have deprived farmers of their land and made it worthless. Commonage used to be worth money but now it is a liability. It is sad the Government, Dúchas, Europe or whoever has done that. Next week there will be a public meeting of the IFA in Castlebar and I hope the Minister and officials from his Department and from Dúchas will attend because there is outrage in the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">It took five years to organise de-stocking and send out letters, but the appeals unit has not even  been set up yet. It should have been in place before the Minister announced de-stocking. I call on the Minister, the Department, Dúchas and everyone involved in de-stocking to freeze the scheme and sit down with the IFA and the farmers to work out a solution that will not be so severe for rural areas. That is a reasonable request because people were caught unaware. They knew there would be de-stocking but not on this scale. The Minister should sit down with Teagasc and the planners to work out an independent scheme, without involving Dúchas, the Department of Agriculture and Food and An Taisce, which objects to this on a regular basis. An Taisce and Dúchas have destroyed rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">The Minister knows that farmers have been leaving the land in recent years. In the hill sheep sector we have destroyed an industry in which people made their livelihoods and handed it on to their families. We have made their land worthless.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">The Minister must freeze this scheme, commission an independent study and sit down with the farmers and the IFA to work out a deal. This has devastated rural areas and it is wrong. Not only does the scheme affect commonage land, it will in furture affect green land. The Minister is from a rural area in County Galway. Why did farmers in Galway only have to de-stock by 20% when there was de-stocking by 40% in my constituency? Is it because there is a senior Minister from that constituency at the Cabinet table? That Minister told farmers in County Mayo that this would be good for them, for farming and for rural areas and that they would not have to de-stock by more then 15%. Some farmers have had to de-stock by between 30 and 70%. That is an awful cut in anyone's income. If my income, that of the Minister or that of someone working in the private sector was cut by €15,000, we would shout and roar.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The Minister must look at this again and consult the farmers. The de-stocking level is too high. Since the culled ewe scheme, the Minister, the Department and Dúchas must admit that the mountain areas were improving again. This must be re-examined.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_592">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_1047">I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter. County Mayo is the third largest county in Ireland but it is a rural area with many farmers. A national emergency would be declared if what is happening there happened in Dublin. It is like a factory with 100 employees being lost every week and it is a terrible tragedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">County Mayo is carrying 37% of the overall de-stocking of the country. It accounts for nearly two out of every five sheep de-stocked. There are de-stocking levels of 60 to 80% while the figure is about 20% everywhere else. If these levels of de-stocking are introduced immediately, they will affect farmers' payments from January.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">The fact that the letters issued after the Nice referendum was unfortunate as the breeding season has started and ewes and rams are already in place. In the area where I live there are 70 farmers involved in 18 commonages. They had an unfortunate experience having been told last February that the destocking rate would be 16% when in fact it is 17.68%. That is regrettable because they worked on the assumption that it would be 16% rather than 17.68%. There is an issue of natural justice here. These farmers who were forced to destock do not know the reason. They have tried to get the framework plans but were unable to obtain the information they need to get an understanding of what this is all about. I demand that the Minister and his officials make this information available forthwith to the farmers of Mayo. Justice is demanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">The method of calculation is suspect. The lowlands destocking rate is reduced by the amount of a farmer's commonage. The farmer ends up with a low stocking level across all his or her green land. The farmer's land is devalued and his or her income is decimated. The financial loss caused by Mayo's sheep quota reduction of 55,000 is devastating for many rural DEDs. The loss of the sheep quota alone takes in excess of €1.5 million per annum out of the struggling rural areas of Mayo. When one considers that the CLÁR programme represents a commitment of only €12 million per annum spread over 16 counties, the Government is removing far more from the depopulated DEDs than it will ever put back through the CLÁR or any other programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">There is clear discrimination against key producers who have commonage and lowland. This unnecessarily harsh destocking rate is grossly unfair. Farmers have invested substantially in sheds for wintering and having been encouraged to do one thing by one policy will now be deprived of the ability to pay for improving their enterprise by a hopelessly mismanaged change of policy. This does not make sense. This is about destocking people as well as sheep. It is about taking people from the land which is the final insult.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">It is clear from the census of population that north and west Mayo are already in crisis and need special status. If the Government is interested in retaining people in rural Ireland this is a strange way of going about it by removing the financial viability of whatever subsistence farmers have still left on the land. What is the point in filling potholes if there are no people to drive on these roads?</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">The money lost to the Mayo area will be lost to the shopkeepers and all who derive a livelihood from the area. They will suffer the knock-on effect as more houses and small shops close. It is ironic that the EU and Government policy which encouraged farmers to increase stocking  levels has undergone a major U-turn and farmers are expected to pick up the tab for the environmental mistakes of EU planners. It is a right mess. Farmers have a moral right to compensation as they were misled by these institutions. Farmers are being driven off the land and their land has been grossly devalued. Where is the future for young farmers seeking a quota or trying to build on the land? Their future is then removed, they cannot farm and they cannot build. We deserve equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">In summary, there are two basic issues here: that non-commonage land should be taken out of the equation and the anomaly that exists under the present stocking calculation, based on previous sheep numbers, will have to be replaced by a stock carrying capacity, based on the amount of shared land owned by each individual on the commonage and on the overall stock carrying capacity of that commonage. In fairness, based on the time of year when ewes are already pregnant destocking should be deferred until July or August 2003. This will be the first step on the road to equality for Mayo farmers. Mayo farmers matter. We have suffered enough, let us not suffer more.</p>

          <p eId="para_1056">Last month, our Department wrote to over 6,000 farmers with commonage about their permitted stocking levels for the 2003 ewe premium year. These figures were preliminary calculations done by our officials, on foot of the commonage framework plans. In 4,183 cases there was a requirement to destock on existing levels. Over 650 farmers who previously had ewe quota frozen will have some restored, and the remainder will not have to destock any further. The average net destocking requirement is 20 ewes per farmer-flockowner. While letters have issued to a number of farmers requiring them to destock to single figures or to destock completely, the position is that all such farmers can retain a flock of ten ewes, on which premium can continue to be paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">It is important to bear in mind that the letters on stocking levels were sent to farmers as part of an agreement that our Department negotiated with the EU Commission in 1998, which secured generous REPS payments of up to €242 a hectare for farmers with commonage. Getting this agree ment was a major negotiating achievement for Ireland in unfavourable circumstances. It was negotiated at a time when over-grazing by sheep, particularly on commonages in the west, had reached a point where the European Commission had threatened to stop all REPS payments on those areas. The Department already had to stop processing REPS applications in the six western counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Galway, Mayo and Kerry which that included large areas of commonage. However, the negotiated agreement with the European Commission turned the situation around. As a result, we are now paying an additional €7 million a year, on top of the basic REPS payment, to the 3,700 farmers with commonage land, who are in REPS. This represents an average annual additional payment of €1,800 per farmer, and brings the total average annual payment for REPS farmers with commonage land to €7,100.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">It was a condition of the 1998 agreement with the European Commission, that we prepared individual framework plans for each commonage. A framework plan is a scientific assessment of the commonage by two professionals – an agriculturalist and an ecologist. The exercise was co-ordinated by officials of our Department and Dúchas. They selected the planning teams, trained them, and checked each plan as it was submitted to ensure consistency. Each framework plan describes the state of the soil and vegetation on a commonage and recommends the level of stocking that it can carry. In many cases, the number of sheep needs to be reduced to protect the commonage from damage, or to allow it to rejuvenate, if over-grazing has already damaged it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">Shortly after the agreement was negotiated with the European Commission, it became clear that the framework planning exercise would be a major one and would take much longer than had been estimated. To secure the new REPS payments, it was necessary to put an interim arrangement in place. This was a 30% reduction in ewe numbers in the six western counties, which was done by freezing sheep quota across the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">Given that most of the framework plans are finished and we know the exact state of each commonage, our Department has been able to calculate the appropriate stocking level for every farmer. Over 600 farmers who had quota frozen in 1998 will now have some restored. Others can remain as they are. Regrettably, there are cases in the six western counties and elsewhere, where commonages are still overstocked. I appreciate the destocking figures in parts of County Mayo are above the average, but unfortunately all that shows is that the over-grazing problem was at its worst in those areas and there is no alternative but to rectify it now, before it is too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">The destocking arrangements are an integral part of the agreement with the European Com mission, that was secured in 1998, which allowed us to make such generous payments in REPS. Any attempt to get out of implementing them would jeopardise those payments. Nevertheless, we have gone to great lengths, within the terms of the agreement, to make the arrangements as flexible as possible. Farmers have a full year to bring their sheep numbers down to the correct level, so they can choose the best time to sell them. There is no such thing as it being mandatory to get rid of them now. There is flexibility and there is time. Even on commonages with the most severe over-grazing problems, no farmer will have to destock by more than 50% in 2003 and no farmer will have to destock, below ten ewes. Farmers with small areas of commonage, may opt not to farm the commonage or claim any area-based payments on it, and in that case no destocking will apply to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">We will shortly announce details of an appeals process. Since the framework planning was a scientific exercise, appeals can only be on a scientific basis. The appeals process will be similar to the existing SAC system in that a commonage that is the subject of an appeal, will be reassessed by other professionals. Groups of farmers who lodge appeals will be given financial assistance towards the cost of the reassessment of their commonage. This again shows generosity on the part of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">Farmers, who are subject to destocking will be required to join REPS or a complementary national scheme to be operated by Dúchas. I understand the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has proposals with the EU Commission for a scheme based on compensation for ewes destocked. Farmers will have a year to choose which scheme they want to join and to submit an application for the scheme of their choice. Again an option is being given.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">Any change to the 1998 agreement would have to be renegotiated with the EU Commission, which would be serious. In the context of the recently announced consultative process on REPS – I made a personal public appeal to anybody who had ideas about REPS to make a submission before the deadline to the Department on the issue and I reiterate that appeal tonight – the participating stakeholders will have an opportunity to raise the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">The design and supervision of the framework planning process has ensured that it was carried out in a consistent and equitable way. The appeals system will be a transparent method of resolving any doubts about individual plans. However, I emphasise again that destocking is the other side of an agreement that has allowed us to pay large amounts of money to REPS farmers with commonage since 1998. The payments have been flowing and we have ensured they were not interrupted. We negotiated the agreement and got the flexibility. We cannot go back at this  stage. We could lose all. By any standard, €242 per hectare is a generous payment, and it is critical that common sense prevail in order to protect and sustain these payments for all farmers.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - School Completion Programme.</heading>
        <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_594">
          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_1066">St. Laurence College in Loughlinstown is a secondary school. Loughlinstown is the subject of the CODAN scheme – County Dublin areas of need – the RAPID programme and the Southside Partnership. It is one of the more disadvantaged areas of Dublin and certainly one of the most disadvantaged areas of Dun Laoghaire. The area has been the focus of much social investment over the past few years and all of this is improving the situation there very significantly. St. Laurence College is a school in the Marianist tradition. It has a number of feeder primary schools in the area. The four local primary schools are also based in Loughlinstown and neighbouring Ballybrack. The other secondary school associated with the school completion programme is Cabinteely community school. These six schools, two secondary and four primary, have worked together over the past two years on the stay-in-school retention initiative. This was an important scheme which is bearing fruit in the key social aim of keeping children in disadvantaged areas in school for the longest possible time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">I was a secondary school teacher in Ballyfermot a few years ago and one of the things that was glaringly obvious was the failure of so many students to stay in school in the first place and the almost non-existent graduation to university attendance from such areas. This is also the case in St. Laurence College in Loughlinstown.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">In 2001 St. Laurence College was informed that the school completion programme was to be introduced and that it was to be kept in the stay-in-school retention initiative until 2006. It now appears that St. Laurence College is to be left out of the school completion programme and that the only other competition for feeder schools in the area, Cabinteely community school, is to be retained. Cabinteely community school has been a very worthy and successful participant in the scheme up to now, but St. Laurence College should not be left out of it. There are three reasons for this. First, St. Laurence College receives 80% of its current student roll from those four feeder schools that I mentioned earlier. The Minister is aware of the consequences for St. Laurence College if it is no longer involved in a scheme with those four feeder schools. Second, there is a decreasing student roll in the four schools I mentioned which will have consequences for St. Laurence College, independent of its exclusion from the scheme. Finally, the school retention scheme has a budget of €250,000 whereas the stay-in-school retention initiative will  be phased out by 2005 and will only involve funding in the region of about €10,000 over the next year or so. There is a clear inequality there, and there are clear reasons why St. Laurence College should be retained within the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">The criteria for leaving out St. Laurence College have not been made clear at this point and they may well be nobly and well motivated. However, it is my impression that whoever made the decision was not fully aware of the facts on the ground and may not have been familiar with the local area. St. Laurence College is the only secondary school in Loughlinstown. The other school is in Cabinteely and also serves places such as Foxrock and Cornelscourt which are fairly wealthy areas. It is probably not appropriate that Cabinteely community school is the only school included in the school retention scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">This is an unusual case in that I am not asking the Minister to spend any more money and I am quite aware of the changed climate that exists at the moment. All I am looking for is a political decision to override a decision which I believe was not properly made.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_595">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1071">I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to this House the position regarding this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">The school completion programme, which is a new and expanded programme to deal with early school leaving, was introduced earlier this year. It incorporates the elements of best practice established by the eight to 15-year-old early school leaver initiative and the stay-in-school retention initiative at second level, the pilot phases of which came to an end in July and August last respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">SCP is designed to deal with issues of both concentrated and regionally dispersed disadvantage and is a key component of the Department of Education and Science strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. Significant funding has been made available to this programme over the next three years –€23.1 million in 2003, €23.5 million in 2004 and €24.1 million in 2005 – under the national development plan with assistance from the European Social Fund. The school completion programme recognises that a wide variety of home, community and school-based factors can contribute to low school attainment and early school leaving. Improving student retention to completion of senior cycle at second level can be achieved only by enhancing the educational experience of those for whom school may be irrelevant or unimportant. Consequently, strategies designed to address the needs of young people at risk of early school leaving must include a range of actions that impinge on  these aspects of young people's lives. These strategies must, therefore, be holistic and child-centred by nature. The school completion programme aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">The programme will focus on the areas of greatest need. Sites for participation have been selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level, using the Department of Education and Science post-primary pupils database. This analysis also identified the main feeder primary schools. A total of 82 projects – 65 new projects sites, together with the existing 17 ESLI projects – have been selected to participate in the school completion programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">A local management group must be established to manage each of the projects at local level. School completion projects must have representatives of relevant schools, parents, together with local statutory, voluntary and community agencies. This local management group will consult with the local home-school community liaison committee, where one exists, on a two-way advisory basis. Evidence generated from the pilot phases of the school completion programme shows that the most effective way to address educational disadvantage is through an integrated services approach. The local management group will therefore be required to assess the needs of marginalised, educationally disadvantaged young people at local level and to devise an integrated, costed, focused and targeted retention plan that will support these young people in their school, home and community life. Representatives of schools and agencies on the local management group must engage school staff and parents in a consultative and planning process so that the retention plan supports the needs of all young people at risk. The retention plan will offer in-school, after-school, out-of-school and holiday time supports to young people at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">A national co-ordinating team that comprises a national co-ordinator and four assistant national co-ordinators supports the school completion programme. It is the task of the national co-ordinating team to advise on and monitor the integrated area based retention plans that support the young person at risk at local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">In addition to the 82 school completion projects, the Department of Education and Science is continuing to support 53 second level schools which were funded previously under the Stay in School retention initiative, but were not selected for the project phase on this occasion. These 53 schools, which include St. Laurence's College, Loughlinstown, will be supported under the Stay  in School retention phase of the schools completion projects on a phasing out basis over the next three years to 31 August 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">With regard to the funding available to this programme in future, any decision to include further project sites will be based on a selection process using the most current detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level from the Department of Education and Science post primary pupils database.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - General Practitioner Co-operatives.</heading>
        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_596">
          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1079">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise the serious issue which arose at St. John's Hospital in Enniscorthy on 1 November last.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">Does the Minister understand the seriousness of a situation where 150 patients are affected by a lack of cover by doctors, and must travel from Enniscorthy to Wexford for ordinary medical care? Is the Minister really aware of the position in the hospital? It is disorientating for patients, and elderly patients have had to be moved for routine medical care on several occasions in the past week. It can take over one hour to transfer a patient from St. John's Hospital to Wexford General Hospital and I want to know the provisions the Minister has made to deal with emergencies that may arise. I also want to know if the crisis is the result of poor communications or a lack of understanding of the patients' needs. Has the Minister for Health and Children any comment to make on nurses' liability for medical complications that may arise during this dispute?</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">When a patient is moved from the hospital in Enniscorthy to Wexford General Hospital, the casualty department in Wexford is held up. The patient must wait for routine treatment in Wexford while there is no doctor on call at St. John's. The Minister must resolve this problem as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">Funding has been put in place for Caredoc in County Wexford, as have sufficient cars and equipment, and it will take only a small amount of money to bring the scheme to the county. Caredoc was to be introduced in October 2002. The Minister has known since September that this would happen but he did not react to the real needs of patients. He should introduce Caredoc to Wexford and, if he will not do that, he must solve this problem as soon as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_597">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1083">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for giving the Minister for Health and Children an opportunity to put the position on this matter on record. One of the key objectives of the Minister for Health and Children is to promote, develop and provide an effective and efficient system of general practitioner out of hours co-operatives. The development of such co- operatives forms a central plank in the Government's primary care strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">A good example of successful implementation of such a co-operative can be seen in Caredoc, operating in the South Eastern Health Board area. Since its introduction, the Department of Health and Children has provided more than €4 million in funding to Caredoc. This represents merely part of the approximately €20 million the Government has provided nationally to support the development of general practice out of hours co-operatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">The current issue at St. John's Hospital involves the withdrawal of cover by a group of general practitioners who had an agreement with the health board to provide out of hours cover to the hospital. I understand that responsibility for the out of hours cover to St. John's was to transfer to the Caredoc co-operative when it commenced in the Wexford area. This was to be part of a proposed expansion of Caredoc. I am also aware that the existing formal arrangement for out of hours cover at St John's had been due to expire at the end of September, but that the doctors agreed to extend the arrangement for one month pending the planned start-up of the Wexford co-operative. Any decision regarding the expansion of Caredoc to Wexford is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board. In making a decision on expansion, the health board would have due regard to the range of financial and other issues involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">Having considered these issues in late summer 2002, the South-Eastern Health Board decided to defer the expansion of Caredoc until it receives confirmation of funding for 2003. However, the board has informed my Department that the expansion of Caredoc into County Wexford remains a priority. Notwithstanding this, my Department is pursuing funding to expand Caredoc, and the co-operatives operating in other health board areas, through the 2003 Estimates process. Until the outcome of the Estimates process is known, my Department cannot give assurances to any health board over additional funding for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">My Department has been informed that medical services continue to be available two days a week. In addition, support is available to the hospital from the geriatrician at Wexford General Hospital. For medical emergencies, it is normal practice for patients at St. John's to be transferred to Wexford, 15 miles away, and this procedure remains in place. Additionally, patients from St. John's will be fast-tracked through accident and emergency at Wexford General Hospital during the dispute.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">The position in relation to additional funding to expand Caredoc into Wexford will obviously become clearer when the Book of Estimates for 2003 is published tomorrow. It is unfortunate that the issue of out of hours general practitioner  cover to St. John's Hospital has become embroiled in what is essentially a funding matter. However, the South Eastern Health Board has assured my Department that it is willing to work with the general practitioners involved to try to resolve any issues outstanding, no matter what  the outcome of the Estimates process. I encourage all sides in this dispute to make every effort to resolve this matter as soon as possible in the interests of the elderly patients concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 November 2002.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_1094">I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 75 and 135, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">I refer the Deputy to the replies to recent questions on the issue of debt relief given by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to Deputy John McGuinness on 24 October 2002, and Deputy Richard Bruton on 15 October 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">The heavily indebted poor countries initiative, or HIPC, launched by the World Bank and the IMF in 1996 seeks to lower the debts of 42 indebted poor countries to sustainable levels. Under the initiative the level of debt relief granted is related to defined debt sustainability criteria. These in turn are based on statistics such as debt to exports ratios. All Ireland Aid's programme countries except Lesotho are classified as heavily indebted.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_46">By September 2002, 26 countries had qualified for debt relief amounting to $25 billion under the HIPC initiative. About half of this relief stems from a reduction in their debts to the World Bank, the IMF and regional development banks. The remainder comes from the cancellation of their bilateral debts to individual governments. Almost all of the major government creditors have indicated that they will write off 100% of the debts owed to them by the HIPC countries qualifying for debt relief. The debt relief granted  to date translates into a reduction of 50%, on average, in the annual debt service payments of the HIPC countries, or annual savings of $800 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_47">In July 2002, I launched a new debt relief strategy which had been agreed with the Department of Finance. This updates and develops the Government's position on the debt crisis which had been issued in September 1998.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_48">The strategy raises a number of concerns about the operation of the HIPC Initiative, such as the adequacy of the existing level of debt relief and the projections and assumptions used in the calculation of sustainable debt levels. The Bank and the IMF have admitted that between eight and ten countries emerging from the HIPC process continue to have unsustainable debt levels.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_49">In their efforts to estimate sustainable debt levels, the bank and the IMF have used optimistic assumptions, particularly about the future export revenues of the HIPC countries. The bank and the IMF have also focused on economic indicators, such as the value of exports, rather than on development indicators, such as the amount of money a country has available to spend on health and education.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_50">Ireland also believes that the impact of HIV/AIDS on the economies of HIPC countries should be taken into account in assessing debt relief. In countries where almost one adult in three is infected, such as in Zambia, there clearly will be huge economic implications.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_51">Based on the detailed analysis set out in the debt strategy, we have concluded that, in principle, the total cancellation of the debts of the heavily indebted poor countries is a politically acceptable objective and one that we would support. In our view, debt cancellation should be extended to those HIPC countries who are making progress in implementing economic reform and are committed to good governance. We believe any such cancellation should take place within the framework of the existing HIPC initiative, which has strong safeguards to ensure that the resources released through debt relief are channelled to social sectors, such as health and education, and are not abused.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_52">We also stressed that debt cancellation should be funded entirely through additional contributions from donors. In our view, it would not be possible to fund debt cancellation, wholly or partially, from the resources of the bank and the IMF. Cancellation would, in effect, require faster progress by the larger donors towards meeting the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development assistance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_53">Ireland has never given development assistance in the form of loans and is not owed any money by the heavily indebted poor countries. We have, however, contributed generously to international debt relief efforts. In 1998, the Government announced a package of £31.5 million for debt relief in the form of contributions to multilateral debt relief funds at the World Bank and the IMF and to national debt relief funds in Tanzania and  Mozambique. In 2001, we paid an additional £4.5 million to the World Bank earmarked for debt relief in Ethiopia. Our share of the EU contribution to the World Bank HIPC trust fund is €6 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_54">I was in Washington last week where I had the opportunity to discuss a wide range of development issues, including debt, with the World Bank. I also briefed Canada, the leader of our constituency at the Bretton Woods Institutions, on our ideas. The Taoiseach reiterated our commitment in principle to debt cancellation in his address to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September. In October we participated in a World Bank meeting convened to discuss the current financing gap that has arisen in the HIPC trust fund.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_55">Ireland Aid, in close co-ordination with the Department of Finance, will continue to promote our views on debt relief in all relevant international fora. In the coming months we will monitor closely developments in the HIPC process and participate actively in all relevant international meetings. Our debt strategy will guide us as we seek to ensure that the HIPC countries efforts to achieve the millennium development goals are not inhibited by a continuing high level of debt and that a sustainable exit from the debt treadmill is secured.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1101">The EU General Affairs and External Council, GAERC, on 21 October condemned in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attacks on October 12, 2002 in Bali, Indonesia. The GAERC expressed its deepest sympathy and condolences to the governments and peoples, and to the victims and families who suffered as a consequence of this attack. I also conveyed the Government's sympathies to victims and to the Balinese people in a statement on 13 October.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">The council has confirmed its determination to play a full role in the fight against terrorism, and to use all available instruments to combat terrorism in respect of the rule of law and international law. The EU will co-operate closely, and extend its full support to the Government of Indonesia in its efforts to bring the perpetrators of this atrocity to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">The council has agreed to develop its co-operation with Indonesia on counter-terrorism measures, notably in the fight against money laundering and financing of terrorism. The council welcomed the strengthening of anti-terrorism co-operation within ASEAN, and urged the Indonesian authorities to pursue further progress in this area. International security and counter-terrorism are also likely to feature on the agenda of the forthcoming EU and ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting on 27-28 January 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">Last week, an EU Troika visited Indonesia on the 7-8 November and met the President, the Co-ordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Chief of Indonesian Police, parliamentarians and representatives of the Muslim community. Meanwhile, a number of EU member states have been assisting the Indonesian police in connection with the bombings. Officials from my Department continue to monitor the situation in south-east Asia, including the Philippines and Thailand, as well as Indonesia, and are updating travel advice as appropriate.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_56">The UN Security Council issued a resolution on 14 October condemning the bomb attacks and urged all states to work together and co-operate with the Indonesian authorities in their efforts to bring the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of these terrorist attacks to justice. The Security Council also expressed its reinforced determination to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations. On 18 October, the Indonesian Government issued two emergency anti-terrorism decrees under which a new counter-terrorism task force will have very extensive powers of detention and the power to search private homes without a warrant. The country's two largest Muslim organisations, representing more than 70 million Indonesians, have given their support to the new decrees, though these  measures have given rise to concern by several NGOs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_57">Further to its national efforts, Indonesia is also taking part in regional counter-terrorism initiatives and has signed a number of agreements with Malaysia, the Philippines and Australia, aimed at improving co-operation in the fight against terrorism.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_58">On 5 November, Indonesian police arrested a man suspected of involvement in the Bali bombings. He is understood to be a student of Abu Bakar Bashir, the leader of the terrorist group, Jemaah Islamiah. Bashir was arrested on 28 October. The police have since detained Habib Rizieq Shihab, leader of the Front for the Defence of Islam. Both are being questioned in relation to a series of Christian church bombings and an alleged plot to assassinate President Sukarnoputri.</summary>

I understand the convictions are to be the subject of an appeal. It is essential that this appeal be conducted in a manner which is fair and impartial and free from political considerations.

          <p eId="para_1116">A meeting of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council  is to take place at Head of State and Government level in Prague on 22 November. Representatives from the 46 countries that participate in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council are invited to attend, including representatives from the other neutral and non-aligned participants, namely, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland. Ireland will be represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">The EAPC is the multilateral political framework for partnership for peace nations. Since its inception in 1997, the EAPC has developed into an overarching political structure complementing and reinforcing the work of other international organisations. The EAPC serves as an important forum for discussions in the broad Euro-Atlantic area on the future development of peacekeeping, as well as on non-military areas of co-operation such as civil emergency planning and disaster relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">The EAPC meeting on 22 November in Prague is the first at Head of State and Government level since Ireland joined on 1 December 1999. However, Ireland has previously attended at ministerial level the separate six-monthly meetings of Foreign and Defence Ministers from the EAPC countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">The meeting in Prague is expected to focus on the future direction of Partnership for Peace and of the EAPC in the twenty-first century. A review of the partnership is being finalised that will not alter in any way the basis of Ireland's participation. This is founded on a principle of "self-differentiation", whereby each participant in the partnership determines the nature, scope and limits of its participation. Aspects of partnership that have relevance to the fight against terrorism will also be under consideration. The current situation in the Balkans will be reviewed, especially with reference to the UN authorised, NATO-led, peace support operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina (SFOR) and in Kosovo (KFOR), in which Ireland has participated for several years.</p>

          <p eId="para_1127">I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 79 and 124 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">The work of the European Convention, which has been meeting since February, has increased in pace, particularly since the summer. The recent publication by the Convention's President, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, of a preliminary draft constitutional treaty was a significant development.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_61">The draft proposes that the existing treaties would in effect be replaced by a new, consolidated and more coherently structured single  treaty, reflecting the fact that the European Union would have a single legal personality. The treaty would begin with a preamble; there would then be a first, constitutional, section setting out the basic principles, objectives and structures of the Union; a lengthier second section would set out the detailed policies and their implementation; and a third section would contain the normal final provisions. This seems a sensible approach, particularly if it resulted in a treaty which was more accessible and intelligible to the ordinary citizen. The draft also suggests greater simplicity and uniformity in setting out the different areas of the Union's work – the so-called ‘pillar' structure would no longer apply. Providing this does not suggest a homogenous approach across all of the different policy areas, it could be a useful step towards greater clarity.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_62">However, it is early days and the draft is very much in headline form. It lists many possible areas for inclusion which have yet to be discussed at any level in the Convention. It very much remains to be seen how this initial ‘skeleton' will be fleshed out.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_63">As regards a possible name, this is one of those areas which has yet to be discussed in any substance by the Convention. The draft sets out four possible alternatives – European Community, European Union, United States of Europe and United Europe. From the little that has been said to date, it is clear that there is no great support in the convention for change. People have expressed a view that the wider public is comfortable with the name ‘European Union' and that there does not appear to be any reason to move away from this. I share the view that United States of Europe would not be appropriate, and would have a strong preference for keeping the name ‘European Union'.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">Ireland is working hard to influence the shape of the convention's work, which will be a key input to the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference. The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, as the Government's representative, is playing a full and active part, as are the representatives of the Oireachtas, including Deputy Bruton who is a member of the convention's praesidium.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_65">The Government is approaching the convention, and will approach the Intergovernmental Conference, in a positive and constructive manner. We recognise the need for reform if the European Union is to rise to the new challenges ahead and if it is to sustain and develop public support across the member states. However, the Union has been an overwhelming success and we should not lose sight of this. In moving forward, we should take great care to protect the institutional balances and the broad policy mix which have served us well to date. There is wide support for this view across the convention, and on the basis of its proceedings to date some very useful proposals, including for enhancing the role of national parliaments in the Union, are likely to gain consensus support. It will also be necessary  to monitor developments on matters of particular sensitivity very carefully.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_66">With regard to the need for a referendum, obviously the convention will only bring forward recommendations. A decision to bring forward a new treaty for ratification by the member states would be for unanimous decision by the subsequent intergovernmental conference. In due course the Government would have to make a final decision, on the basis of the scale, scope and legal implications of such a treaty, on whether a referendum was required to enable Ireland to ratify it. At this stage, however, it seems highly likely that there will be a referendum.</summary>

Planning and development of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union for the first half of 2004 has already begun and is taking place against the background of decisions taken at the Seville European Council last June. While decisions on priorities will be made much closer to the date of the Presidency, there is already a number of key issues on the Union's agenda for 2004. These include: enlargement; the possible conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference; the Lisbon Agenda at the spring European Council in March 2004; the treaty deadline for the completion of the area of freedom, justice and security – 1 May 2004; and the negotiations in the WTO development round due for completion in January 2005.</p>

          <p eId="para_1143">I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 137 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">Ireland ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in April 2002 following a referendum to amend the Constitution. We remain fully committed to the court in line with our political and legal obligations as a State party to the statute and under the EU Common Position of June 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">US concerns about the ICC, which came to the fore in recent months with the entry into force of the statute on 1 July last, are based on the view that the court's claim to jurisdiction over nationals of states not party to the statute, when the alleged crime is committed on the territory of a state party, is an unacceptable erosion of state sovereignty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">Earlier this year, the US approached the majority of UN member states, including Ireland, requesting that they enter into bilateral agreements of the type envisaged in Article 98(2) of the Rome Statute. Article 98(2) stipulates that the ICC must respect international agreements that require the consent of the sending state for the surrender of a suspect, and may not act if the surrender of a suspect would violate such an agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">The Government believes that US concerns about the court can be satisfied under the Rome Statute and by means of other international instruments. Existing agreements between Ireland and the US which may be of relevance include the 1983 Extradition Treaty and the Treaty on Mutual Assistance on Criminal Matters, which is expected to be ratified in the coming months. International law rules on diplomatic and state immunity, which provide for immunity from criminal jurisdiction for certain holders of high-ranking office, and the Geneva Conventions may also be relevant.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_69">While we see no prohibition within the Rome Statute itself to the adoption of certain types of bilateral agreement, the EU Council of Ministers decided in September that entering into the agreement requested by the US, as presently proposed, would be inconsistent with the obligations of parties to the statute. The Council agreed on guiding principles on what should be included in an agreement to be consistent with the Rome Statute and the existing EU Common Position. Any solution should ensure that credible allegations are investigated and prosecuted, should only cover non-nationals of an ICC state party  and should cover only persons sent abroad in an official capacity by a state.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">Ireland has not entered into an Article 98 (2) agreement with the US. The Government will consider any future request to do so in the context of the agreed EU position.</summary>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_611">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1150">I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 116 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">The Government is acutely conscious of the need to strengthen the United Nations in order to fulfil the commitment made in the Millennium Summit Declaration to ensure a more effective instrument for pursuing the fight for peace and development and against poverty, ignorance and disease.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">The Millennium Summit, which took place in September 2000, provided fresh impetus to the reform process and, in line with the commitment in the Millennium Summit Declaration, the Government strongly supports the reform process initiated by Secretary General Annan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">The Secretary General's recently published report on reform of the UN system, Strengthening of the United Nations: An Agenda for Further Change, represents a significant next step in the reform process. While many of the measures proposed can be implemented immediately under the authority of the Secretary General, others will be the subject of further discussion among member states. Ireland and its EU partners will continue to stress that the reform process is not simply a cost-cutting exercise, but one which is aimed at strengthening and renewing the UN system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">The financial problems which the UN faced over the past decade caused difficulties in advancing UN reform. Ireland welcomes the payment by the US of much of the arrears it owed to the organisation. This has eased considerably the pressure on the UN's finances and has added impetus to the reform process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">One of the most difficult issues facing the UN membership generally is the question of Security Council reform. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a working group, open to all UN member states, to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Council. The working group has been meeting regularly in New York since 1993, with Ireland as an active participant, but progress has been disappointing.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_71">The issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, the Council's working methods and its decision-making procedures including, crucially, the use of the veto. Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats to create an enlarged Council of between 20 and 25 members. We strongly believe that any agreement on enlargement should not diminish the possibility for smaller UN member states to serve on the Council as non-permanent members.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_72">A significant number of other member states opposes the creation of new permanent seats on the Council and this has created difficulties for the working group. Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in seeking agreement on this issue.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_73">On Security Council working methods, there appears to be fairly wide consensus that these should be more formalised and transparent, involving greater consultation by the Council with other UN organs, including the General Assembly and Secretary General, and, in peacekeeping matters, with troop contributing countries. As a member of the Security Council, Ireland has taken an open and transparent approach to the work of the Council, consulting widely with interested countries outside the Security Council, including in the area of peacekeeping. I am pleased that we have been able to live up to our campaign pledge to adopt a consultative approach to our membership of the Council.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_74">Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated altogether but, recognising the strong opposition of the permanent members, has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto, and to exercise it only when they consider the question of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time, any new permanent members of the Council would declare that they would never exercise the veto.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">One positive development at the Security Council which is of particular resonance for Ireland is the progress which has been made in strengthening co-operation between the Security Council and countries contributing troops to UN peacekeeping operations. As a permanent troop contributor, we welcome the increased recognition of the vital input which countries contributing troops make to SECCO decision-making.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">Major reforms have been undertaken in UN peacekeeping, on foot of the report of the Panel on UN Peace Operations, the Brahimi report. The report recommended wide ranging institutional, operational, staffing and funding changes to UN peacekeeping operations, most of which have now been implemented. The allocation of adequate resources for operations and for the secretariat remains a key issue and the Secretary General committed in his recent report to presenting peacekeeping budgets in a new format, reflecting a more strategic approach to the process of resource allocation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">Efforts to revitalise the General Assembly and to restore it as the central deliberative, policy-making and representative body of the UN have been undertaken over the years but implementation has often been lacking. It is a slow process given the need to ensure consensus at each stage. In 2001, some small but important steps were agreed, including modest streamlining of the plenary agenda and the greater use of modern technology to enhance efficiency.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_78">Member states are continuing to examine ways of reforming and restoring authority to the General Assembly. On 8 July last, the General Assembly adopted a resolution providing for election of the President of the General Assembly, of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly and the Chairs of the main committees in advance of the regular session. The then President of the General Assembly also circulated a non-paper which proposes a number of reform measures, including the holding of regular meetings between the President and the main committees, suggestions for the organisation of debates, closer involvement of permanent representatives in the budgetary procedure and the use of modern technology. It is intended that the non-paper will remain an informal living document and it will be for successive Presidents to take the discussion further and for the ideas in the paper to be implemented as they ripen.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_79">Progress has also been made on administrative reform in the development area. A UN development group has been established which brings together the heads of all of the development agencies for discussions on co-ordination and coherence. A UN development assistance framework, UNDAF, is in place under which UN agencies in the field are based in a common UN house and are co-ordinated by the resident representative of the UNDP. Co-ordination of the UN's emergency humanitarian operations has been centralised in the Office of the Co-ordinator for Humanitarian Assistance, OCHA.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_80">The Secretary General has proposed further reforms in his recent paper, suggesting that by June 2003 the UN development group should prepare an implementation plan to strengthen the effectiveness of the organisation's presence in developing countries. This plan will include features such as joint programming, which Ireland would support.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_81">Far-reaching reforms have also been implemented in many of the UN's funds and programmes. The UN Development Programme, UNDP, has introduced major management restructuring and is streamlining its operations, decentralising and focusing its work programme. Similarly the UN children's fund, UNICEF, the population fund, UNFPA, and the World Health Organisation, WHO, have also implemented reform programmes. Most of these agencies are now receiving increased donor support, including from Ireland, and are working to strengthen their links with the private sector and private philan thropic foundations. Ireland has sharply increased its funding to the UNDP, €8.95 million in 2002, to UNICEF, €5.5 million in 2002, and to the UNFPA, €1.8 million in 2002, and entered into indicative multi-annual funding commitments with these bodies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_82">I assure the House that reform of the UN remains much a live issue, on which more work remains to be done. Ireland will continue to support the reform process and will engage actively in discussions on the Secretary General's latest report, which provides a good road-map for the way ahead.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1157">As the political and economic importance of the Latin American region continues to grow, the focus of our policy towards Central and South America is to build closer bilateral relations with the countries of the region and, together with our partners in the European Union, to forge a closer bi-regional relationship with Latin America as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">The bi-regional relationship between the European Union and Latin America was given a further impetus by the second Summit of Heads of State and Government of the EU and Latin America and the Caribbean, which took place in Madrid on 17 May last. This summit built on the success of the inaugural EU-Latin America-Caribbean Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June 1999. In Madrid, both sides re-affirmed their commitment to consolidate the strategic partnership between the two regions, based on respect for human rights and international law, the promotion of democracy and co-operation for economic and social development. Ireland will jointly chair the third EU-Latin America-Caribbean Summit, which is expected to take place in Mexico in May 2004, during the Irish Presidency of the EU. With these important commitments in mind, I intend to visit to the region in advance of the Presidency.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_83">Ireland has supported the negotiation of new EU association and partnership agreements with individual countries and regional blocs in Latin America. A global agreement on economic partnership, political co-operation and co-ordination between the EU and Mexico came into effect on 1 July 2000. Ireland is a strong supporter of the global agreement, which provides a framework for the development of our bilateral political and economic relations. The fact that President Fox of Mexico is in Ireland today, making the first ever state visit by a Mexican President to this country, is evidence of our increasingly close relationship with that important country. Earlier today we had an opportunity to review our bilat eral relations and Mexico's developing relations with the EU.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">Following more than two years of negotiations, a comprehensive association agreement between the EU and Chile is to be signed on 19 November next in Brussels. The agreement will then be subject to approval by all member states in accordance with their legal or constitutional requirements. The agreement provides for the establishment of a political and economic association between the EU and each of its member states and Chile, based on reciprocity, shared interests and co-operation in the political, economic, scientific, technological, social and cultural fields. Ireland welcomes the increased opportunities for bilateral co-operation to be provided by the agreement, which will further strengthen our ties with Chile, already advanced significantly this year by their opening of a resident embassy in Dublin.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_85">Negotiations are also proceeding for a new EU-Mercosur association agreement. Brazil is the largest of the Mercosur member states, which also includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. We will seek to build bilaterally on the Taoiseach's visit to Brazil last year when the new Government there takes office.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_86">Agreement was reached at the Madrid EU-LAC Summit on new initiatives to negotiate political and co-operation agreements with the Andean community and also with the countries of Central America, as well as measures to strengthen trade, investment and economic relations. Ireland supports these measures.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">As regards Ireland's economic links with Latin America, it is particularly gratifying that trade and investment in recent years have both between increasing substantially. Between 1995 and 2001 total trade with the region grew from €543 million to €1.84 billion and we look forward to a similar expansion in trade in the coming years. A number of Irish companies have made significant investments in Latin America including Mexico, Argentina and Brazil.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">We are also developing our relations with Latin America through increased Ireland Aid funding to the region. We fund projects in the human rights and democratisation sphere in Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Grenada, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. To date in 2002, Ireland Aid has delivered over €2.2 million in emergency and rehabilitation assistance to countries in Latin America, targeted mainly at housing rehabilitation in the wake of natural disasters and at strengthening local capacities for disaster preparedness. Ireland Aid also continues to support Irish NGOs in the region through the NGO co-financing scheme and NGO block grants. Funding under the NGO schemes has been provided in 2002 to the following Latin American countries: Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_89">The report of the Ireland Aid Review Committee, published by the Government in March 2002,  explored Ireland Aid's involvement to date in Central America in particular. The report noted that Irish NGOs have been particularly active in the region and have developed a strong presence in a number of countries with pressing development needs. The review committee recommended a greater emphasis on longer-term development needs via an intensified involvement in Central America. Ireland Aid is currently examining opportunities for deeper engagement.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_90">The Government is fully seized of the importance of this region of immense potential. Accordingly, Ireland's diplomatic representation in the area has been steadily strengthened over recent years. In addition to the long-standing embassy in Buenos Aires, which also holds accreditation to Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay, a resident embassy was established in Brasilia in November 2001, following the opening of an embassy in Mexico City in 1999, with secondary accreditation to Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, Peru and Venezuela. In An Agreed Programme for Government we are committed to further expanding our resident diplomatic missions in Latin America according as resources permit. As mentioned already, we have also seen the establishment of new missions by Latin American countries in Dublin with the opening of the Chilean embassy earlier this year. Chile joins Cuba, which established a resident mission in 2001, and the longer-established missions of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.</summary>

He also provided an update on the various commissions mandated by the Bonn Agreement – the civil service and constitutional, human rights, and judicial commissions. The Secretary General further set out the efforts by the international community to provide humanitarian assistance, and to support the Afghan Government in reconstruction activities. He also reported his concerns in relation to the security climate, in particular the growing number of acts of terrorism and political violence.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_96">As a member of the Security Council, Ireland continues to underline the crucial importance of a humanitarian strategy to parallel the political and security one. Last week, Ireland organised an informal meeting of Security Council members to hear two key experts on human rights – Dr. Asma Jahangir, special rapporteur on extra judicial, summary or arbitrary executions and Dr. Kamal Hossain, special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Afghanistan. The speakers noted that while enormous progress had been made in relation to human rights, ongoing insecurity and the activities of warlords made it difficult to establish the rule of law. Both speakers recorded their view that the 23 years of conflict had almost completely destroyed the justice system in Afghanistan.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">Ireland provides bilateral assistance to Afghanistan through Irish non-governmental organisations and international agencies. At the International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan, which took place in Tokyo in January 2002, the Government pledged €12 million in reconstruction support over a three-year period, €5.3 million of which has already been delivered to date. An additional €2.2 million was delivered in emergency humanitarian assistance and another €250,000 was pro vided to the UNDP law and order trust fund in support of civil police capacity building in Afghanistan. This brings Ireland's assistance to date in 2002 to €7.75 million. Irish emergency humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan amounted to over €5.08 million in 2001. We will review the position on a continuing basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">The EU is also fully committed to delivering a major contribution to the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The European Commission and the EU member states made substantial pledges for the reconstruction of Afghanistan at the Tokyo conference totalling €594 million for 2002 alone. In addition, the EU has committed €240 million in emergency humanitarian assistance. The European Commission has also recently adopted a new humanitarian aid package worth €17.6 million to support former refugees returning to Afghanistan from neighbouring countries as well as for internally displaced people and other vulnerable and drought-affected populations.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1172">Ireland's approach to the export of arms to all countries is guided by our undertakings at EU level, our political commitments at UN level and our pursuit of development goals, including human rights and democratisation. I agree with the Deputy that the scaling back of arms sales could contribute to a reduction in tensions both regionally and globally, with consequent advantages for economic and social development. The regulation of arms exports is a matter for national authorities, subject to internationally agreed restrictions such as arms embargoes sanctioned by the United Nations. I call on all governments to take full account of the impact of arms proliferation in regulating arms exports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">Ireland participated in establishing an EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports which was adopted by the EU General Affairs Council in June 1998. The code lists the criteria to be taken into account when deciding on whether to allow an export of military goods. One of these criteria provides that member states should look at the level of expenditure of the recipient country on arms relative to their social expenditure, to ensure that the proposed export would not seriously hamper the sustainable development of the recipient country. Ireland also supports efforts both within the European Union and elsewhere to achieve progress in the area of arms brokering.</p>

This conference was the first major step in addressing the problem of small arms proliferation and represented a formal recognition by the member states of the United Nations of the effects of the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons on civilian populations. The major issues dealt with by the conference were export criteria and controls, tracing and marking of weapons and regulation of brokers. The programme of action, agreed by consensus, contains politically binding commitments on these issues at national, regional and international level. It also establishes a framework for follow-up action, including provision for a review conference to be held in 2006.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1177">I propose to take Question Nos. 87, 113 and 183 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">While the Security Council has specific responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of international peace and security, it does not have primary responsibility within the UN system for dealing with economic and social issues such as the impact on developing countries of volatile commodity prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">The recently-published OXFAM report, Mugged: Poverty in Your Coffee Cup, performs the important service of drawing attention to the fact that the livelihoods of 25 million coffee producers are affected by the fall in the price of coffee. There are indications that long-term prospects are grim and that developing country farmers, mostly poor smallholders, are now selling their coffee beans for much less than they cost to produce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">I have noted the recommendations in the OXFAM report that the UN Conference on Trade and Development, UNCTAD, develop a long-term integrated strategy to tackle the problem of commodities and to organise a major international conference on coffee with the International Coffee Organisation by February-March 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">The economies of some of the poorest countries in the world are highly dependent on trade in coffee. In Uganda, the livelihoods of roughly one-quarter of the population are in some way dependent on coffee sales. According to World Bank figures, in 2000 Ugandan coffee exports amounted to 43% of total exports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">There is almost no coffee processing in Uganda so the export price depends on the demand from the major coffee processors. There are four main global coffee roasters which determine the market price for the non-processed crop. The price farmers in Uganda currently receive is US$200 per tonne compared to US$ 3,000 per tonne in 1994. The fall in the price of coffee is almost entirely due to a glut on the world market due to the entry of new producing countries, such as Vietnam.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_102">Already, following the publication of the OXFAM report, the International Coffee Organisation, ICO, of which Ireland, along with the other EU member states, are members, has put in place the coffee quality improvement programme on 1 October 2002. This programme aims to improve the supply of quality coffee on world markets by adopting minimum standards for exported coffee. This measure will improve market equilibrium and help to eliminate the presence of low quality coffee from the market. The ICO has also commenced the implementation of a diversification programme in the Caribbean region to assist farmers and help alleviate poverty. A number of market development activi ties aimed at increasing consumption in both producing and consumption are also in the pipeline.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_103">The relevant EU expert working group is considering the crisis in the coffee market, including contacts with OXFAM, with a view to the preparation of a paper for consideration by Ministers at next week's General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18-19 November 2002. In addition, the issue is under consideration at the United Nations where member states are currently considering a draft resolution on commodities that addresses a number of the issues raised by OXFAM.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_104">I welcome the opportunity of the forthcoming discussion by Ministers at the GAERC to consider how the EU can best assist the developing countries most affected by the volatile coffee price. In the long-term, the international community needs to assist those developing countries whose export sectors are overly dependent on a small number of primary commodities to diversify. Ireland will participate fully in any measures to alleviate the coffee crisis.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1184">: The World Summit on Sustainable Development, which took place in Johannesburg from 26 August to 4 September last, reviewed the global implementation of Agenda 21, the outcome of the Rio conference on environment and development ten years on and agreed a plan of implementation for the further implementation of Agenda 21. Johannesburg also put the promotion of poverty eradication through sustainable development at the heart of its work. Unlike the Rio Summit, which was heavily influenced by the environmental agenda, Johannesburg was the first major summit to treat all aspects of sustainable development, that is, the economic, social and environmental aspects, in a coherent and integrated way.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_105">While the ten days of intensive negotiations at Johannesburg cannot be deemed a total success, the representatives of the more than 190 countries who took part agreed a specific agenda to reduce poverty through action in five key areas: water and sanitation, energy, health, agriculture and biodiversity. These five key areas singled out for action were seen by the summit as crucial to the achievement of poverty eradication through sustainable development. They also build on the already agreed time-bound development goals from the Millennium Summit of the UN. Furthermore, Johannesburg re-affirmed the commitments made at the WTO ministerial meeting at Doha – November 2001 – and at the Inter national Conference on Financing for Development at Monterrey – March 2002 – in relation to trade and financing for development.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_106">In his address to the Johannesburg Summit, the Taoiseach reminded world leaders that ten years ago, when the Rio Conference took place, there was a serious food crisis in southern Africa. A potentially devastating famine in the region was only narrowly averted through the intensive efforts of Governments, donors, NGOs and international organisations, particularly the World Food Programme. The Taoiseach regretted that ten years later, this same region was once again threatened with famine and facing another devastating catastrophe. The Taoiseach underlined that much of this could have been avoided if the world had not missed the targets in the intervening ten years since Rio and had we come up with enough money to finance Rio's action plan, Agenda 21.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">Given the crowded nature of the agenda for the world summit, reaching an agreement that would satisfy all of the participants was always going to be a huge challenge. In the end, the plan of implementation from Johannesburg has shown that the international community, despite internal differences, has managed to agree to work together to find joint solutions to global problems. This relaunch of multilateralism has firmly placed poverty eradication and sustainable development on the international agenda.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_108">Ultimately, the only measure of the success or failure of Johannesburg will lie in the willingness of the international community to deliver on those commitments. We have agreed on the ways and means. The challenge now is to show our political willingness to turn words into deeds. In October, the General Affairs and External Relations Council launched the EU's strategy for the implementation of the Johannesburg plan of implementation. I will be working hard both at the national level and with our partners in the EU to promote the implementation of that strategy and to deliver on the promises that were made at Johannesburg.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1190">During this year's general debate, the shadow and the implications of events since 11 September 2001 and the possibility of conflict with Iraq and in the Middle East were major sources of re-occupation.

          <p eId="para_1191">I spoke on how our experience as a member of the Security Council has strongly reinforced our belief in the system of collective global security and on the importance of the Council's role as guardian of peace and security.</p>

          <p eId="para_1193">I set out Ireland's position on four serious threats to world peace – the Middle East, Iraq, Afghanistan and India and Pakistan. I addressed a number of thematic issues which Ireland regards as particularly important – the control and elimination of weapons of mass destruction, the challenge that conflict prevention presents to the UN and, in that context, the importance of sustainable development as a means of addressing the long-term causes of conflict, the importance of universal access to basic health care Ireland's continuing commitment to UN peacekeeping and the need to respect human rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_1201">I was delighted by the result of the referendum on  the Treaty of Nice in which the people of Ireland gave their overwhelming endorsement to the treaty and to the process of enlargement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">The Government is now making the necessary preparations to allow Ireland to deposit its instrument of ratification with the Foreign Ministry in Rome by the end of the year, allowing the treaty to enter into force at the start of February. This will facilitate the expected signing of an Accession treaty by ten of the applicant countries later in the spring.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">It was clear from the result of the first referendum that many people had concerns about issues relating to our membership of the European Union. Moreover, they also felt that the issues raised by the treaty had not been properly debated. The Government listened carefully to what they had to say and took various steps to address their concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">Together with the main Opposition parties in the House and with many organisations representing civic society, we made concerted efforts to ensure that the people had all the information they needed to reach an informed decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">To help foster a broader debate about the future of Europe and Ireland's role in it, we established the National Forum on Europe which has done excellent work in bringing the discussion to the people. I particularly commend its decision to hold public meetings in areas outside Dublin. The forum is continuing to meet and will continue to make an important contribution as the wider debate on Europe's future unfolds in the European Convention and elsewhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_1208">On this occasion we had the fullest national debate on European issues since our entry to the EEC in 1972. The clear message was that there is a strong recognition of the continuing importance of EU membership to Ireland in the future, coupled with a desire to extend to others the opportunities which we have had. At the same time, we need to ensure that people are properly informed about future developments in the Union, and to work to shape those developments in a manner which continues to reflect Irish interests and concerns.</p>

          <p eId="para_1211">I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 144 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">The communiqué issued on 2 December 2001 following the EU-Cuba political dialogue meeting in Havana, expressed mutual satisfaction at the resumption of the long-standing dialogue, which had been broken off by Cuba in April 2000 following support by EU member states for a resolution critical of Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. The communiqué contains no revision of the common position, which was renewed by the General Affairs Council 10 December 2001 when the Council noted that the situation in Cuba was still "seriously wanting as regards the recognition and application of civil and political freedoms", and endorsed again on 17 June 2002 when the Council reiterated that:</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">the objective of the European Union towards Cuba remains the encouragement of a process of transition to a pluralist democracy, the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as an economic recovery that allows an improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people. The Council expects positive steps by the Cuban Government, which will lead to real reforms towards a political system, based on democratic values. In this sense, the Council follows with interest the evolution of the Varela project, legally based on the constitution, and encourages the Cuban Government to consider it as a legitimate initiative since it represents an important effort to introduce these reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">At the EU-Cuba political dialogue meeting in Copenhagen on 4 November 2002, the EU Troika again urged the Cuban side to give a positive response to the Varela project, a popular Cuban initiative legitimately based on the provisions of the Cuban constitution itself, with the aim of fostering the development of pluralist democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">At the same meeting, the EU also again suggested that it would be helpful if Cuba were to ratify the United Nations Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">While acknowledging progress in, for example, the area of religious freedom, the EU delegation expressed its deep concern regarding the constant harassment of political dissidents and the continuing plight of political prisoners, some of whom have serious health problems.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_111">As I have said before in this House, if the Cuban authorities were to take positive and meaningful steps towards the recognition of international norms in terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms, then I would be one of the first to advocate a revision of the common position to enable the EU to negotiate the same kind of deep and broad-based partnership agreements which the Union maintains with those countries which are committed to the same fundamental values.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_112">In the meantime, Ireland and the EU will do everything possible and practicable to maintain and develop a relationship of mutual respect and reciprocal benefit with Cuba.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_113">On a bilateral level, the Government is keen to see the development of Irish relations with Cuba across the board. Ireland Aid has supported a number of valuable projects in Cuba, including a rural development-food security programme in Cuba in partnership with Trocaire and a Portuguese NGO. The programme is being implemented by the National Association of Small Producers in Cuba. The Ireland Aid contribution is €65,000. In 2001, Ireland Aid made a contribution of € 50,000 to UNICEF's activities in the aftermath of hurricane Michelle. Ireland Aid is happy to consider future specific requests for funding under the human rights and democratisation scheme or the NGO co-financing scheme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1225">The visit of the Minister of State took place against the backdrop of a growing food security crisis in Malawi and Zambia and across the southern Africa region. Recent assessments carried out by the United Nations World Food Programme, WFP, indicate that over 14 million people in southern Africa will be in need of food assistance by next March.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">During the visit the Minister met a wide range of key development stakeholders in Malawi and Zambia. He held discussions with President Mwanawasa of Zambia and Vice President Malewezi of Malawi as well as other senior political representatives.

          <p eId="para_1227">During the visit, the Minister of State witnessed the devastating effect that famine, drought and HIV-AIDs are having on the people of the region.

        <summary eId="sum_123">In response to the food deficit, Ireland Aid, the official aid programme of the Government, has delivered over €8 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance for the affected countries in southern Africa to date this year. In addition to emergency humanitarian assistance, Ireland Aid is also delivering long-term development support to the region with an emphasis on poverty reduction through the provision of basic  needs and capacity building support. In 2002 it is estimated that such support for southern Africa will exceed €80 million.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1229">There has been no reduction in the overall aid budget. The total aid budget for 2002 is at an unprecedented level representing 0.41% of gross national income, GNI, showing an increase of €100 million over 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">Ireland Aid is deeply committed to Ethiopia, which is one of the poorest countries in the world. Since our engagement there began in the mid-1990s, the country has been one of the highest priority areas for the programme because of its endemic poverty, its chronic food insecurity and the fact that such a large population, 64 million, seeks a livelihood from a finite and inadequate land and water base.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">In 2001 Ireland Aid spent over €21 million on a range of interventions in the country. These included, in particular, support to the health and education sectors. We are actively engaged in tackling the challenge of HIV-AIDS, promoting civil service reform and infrastructural projects like roads building.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_126">In addition to our involvement in these sectors, we administer five so-called area based programmes which help the authorities of regions selected to improve the level of services they provide to their people. Assistance is provided in relation to agriculture and food security, health,  education, water and sanitation, rural access roads, public accountability and good governance. Of the 2001 budget for Ethiopia, over €21 million, nearly €15 million was spent on the area based programmes, ABPs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_127">A number of problems have arisen as a result of decentralisation measures introduced by the Ethiopian Government last year. A decision by the Government of Ethiopia to abolish a particular level of local authority and to devolve administrative responsibility downwards has caused some disruption at local level and has reduced, I hope only temporarily, the ability of the local authorities to manage and absorb resources, including transfers from the centre. These problems are currently being addressed by the Ethiopian Government and by the donor community. Until they are resolved, spending levels under the area based programmes will show some reductionsvis-à-vis previous patterns.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_128">The impending food crisis, which will affect up to 12 million people, presents a further challenge. Ireland Aid is monitoring the situation very closely in co-operation with Irish NGOs, the World Food Programme, the EU and other donors. The Minister of State has already committed as a first step €1 million to help purchase emergency food stocks. The Government stands ready to make further allocations in the light of developments.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_129">Ethiopia was threatened by famine in 2000 and early action by donors and the Government helped to head it off. The hope is that it might be possible to do the same this year. On the development side, we hope and expect that the process of administrative reorganisation will be completed in coming months and that this will facilitate a resumption of normal expenditure in the area-based part of the programme.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_130">I have already covered the situation in Iraq in reply to a priority question. The situation in the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and between Israel and its neighbours Syria and Lebanon remains a matter for concern. Violent incidents continue to occur regularly with the loss of innocent life on both sides. The Palestinian population of the West Bank remains severely affected by closures and curfews. A humanitarian crisis is developing. Israel is continuing with the  construction of a security fence with a view to isolating Israel proper and the major illegal settlements from Palestinian areas. Israeli settlement activity is continuing and will make a two state solution more difficult to achieve. As a result of international mediation efforts, the crisis between Israel and Lebanon over the waters of the Hasbani River did not come to a head. However, this issue has not been finally resolved and remains a potential flashpoint.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_131">On 29 October, President Arafat won the approval of the Palestinian Legislative Council for a new cabinet. The new cabinet is committed to continue the process of reform of Palestinian institutions, including security services. Clearly, the effectiveness of Palestinian reforms is dependent to a large extent on the co-operation of the Israeli authorities and their willingness to facilitate Palestinian efforts. The Government welcomes the formation of a new Palestinian administration and the efforts of the Palestinian Authority to pursue reforms.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_132">The resignation of Labour Party Ministers from the Israeli Government has led to the calling of early elections, probably in late January or early February 2003. The caretaker Government is unlikely to take any radical initiatives and may have difficulty in responding to quartet proposals in the next few weeks. The caretaker Government will still have to face its responsibilities and deal with urgent concerns such as closures and the oppressive occupation regime to which the Palestinians of the West Bank are subject. It is a matter of regret that Israel has only a caretaker Government at this difficult time, but we would expect that Government to remain engaged in the search for peace, and conscious of its international responsibilities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_133">On the international level there has been considerable activity with meetings of the quartet preparing a road map for a Palestinian state for adoption at a meeting in Copenhagen in early December. US Assistant Secretary of State Burns visited the region in the final week of October and outlined US views to regional leaders.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_134">Ireland looks forward to the adoption of the road map at the quartet meeting in December. It must contain political, humanitarian, economic, institutional and security elements which will progress in parallel. The European Union is fully engaged as a member of the quartet in formulating the road map for a Palestinian state and European Union envoys are in regular contact with all the major players in the region. Ireland contributes actively to the elaboration of the EU position.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_135">Ireland is also active as a member of the UN Security Council, where the situation in the Middle East is kept under regular review. The Council has passed 12 resolutions on the Middle East since Ireland became a member. Our representatives have been prominent in all of the Council's debates on the issue and are engaged in  current efforts to bring about a two state solution to the conflict.</summary>

Although the talks are on hold at the moment, because Mr. Denktash is recuperating following a heart operation, we expect them to be resumed in the near future. Together with our EU partners, we have called on all the parties involved to co-operate in the process with a view to achieving a political settlement before the end of the negotiations for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">On Monday, Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary General, presented to both sides his proposal for a comprehensive settlement for Cyprus. The Secretary General hopes his initiative will help the parties focus on the decisions that they should take in the next few weeks in order to seize the opportunity at hand and to bring about a settlement. He has asked the leaders of the two communities not to take a formal position on the proposals but to take some time to consider them. He has asked for a response from both sides by next Monday 18 November. The Secretary General briefed the Security Council on Monday on the proposals. The members welcomed the decision to present the proposal and reaffirmed their full support for the Secretary General's efforts. I welcome the Secretary General's proposals and would urge all parties to reflect carefully on their contents and not to take any position which might close off progress in the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_136">If a settlement is not reached in the next few weeks, the Copenhagen European Council will have to make a final decision on admitting a divided Cyprus to the EU. The Helsinki European Council Conclusions of 1999 provide that while a political settlement would facilitate the accession  of Cyprus to the EU, if no settlement has been reached by the end of negotiations, the EU will decide on Cypriot accession without a settlement being a pre-condition and taking into account all relevant factors.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_137">The Government welcomes the terms of the resolution on Cyprus passed by the Select Committee on European Affairs on 31 July 2002. Irish policy in relation to the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is in line with the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. Article 3 of UN Security Council Resolution 550 (1984) of 11 May 1984 reiterates the call upon all states not to recognise the purported State of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus set up by secessionist acts and calls upon them not to facilitate or in any way assist the aforesaid secessionist entity. Article 4 of the same resolution calls upon all states to respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, unity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_138">Ireland supports the terms of Resolution 550 and of other relevant Security Council Resolutions on the situation in Cyprus. The Government's position has not been changed since the Amsterdam treaty or since the first Nice referendum.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1241">The core function of the Council of Europe is to ensure that fundamental human values are the basis for the development of democratic societies throughout the European continent. My Department, through Ireland's permanent representation in Strasbourg, is an active participant in the work of the committee of Ministers, which is the main decision-making body of the Council. Its responsibilities include ongoing evaluation and assessment of the activities and programmes of the organisation and approval of the annual budget. The work and relevance of the Council's activities and Ireland's contribution are also assessed under the strategic management initiative, both in respect of the Department of Foreign Affairs and of the representation in Strasbourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">In my reply to a question from Deputy Durkan on 27 June, I provided a detailed statement of Ireland's current priorities in the Council of Europe. Since then, there have been a number of important developments. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, attended the 111th session of the Committee of Ministers in Strasbourg on 6-7 November. In a bilateral meeting with the Secretary General of the Council and in his interventions, he stressed Ireland's continuing commitment to the Council of Europe, independently of current developments in the EU.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_140">The Council's clearly defined role, set out in the statute of 1949, remains as valid as ever: to achieve a greater unity among all member states, each participating on an equal footing, by safeguarding common ideals and principles. The Council must continue to set standards and work to ensure they are upheld by all States. Ireland supports the proposal for a third summit meeting to consolidate the future role of the Council of Europe, on condition that the summit is well prepared, with a guarantee that it will reinforce and not diminish that role.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_141">We attach priority importance to the Council's work in human rights. In this context, Ireland has been pursuing its initiative to support and reform the European Court of Human Rights. Following a progress report prepared by Ireland's permanent representative in Strasbourg, the ministerial session last week adopted a declaration on the court instructing that work be accelerated in order that substantive decisions on reforms can be taken at the next session in May 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_142">Separately, the session approved a draft protocol to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. Ireland welcomed this development, stressing the unique authority of the Council of Europe in defending its basic values, and the importance of ensuring that the response to terrorism respects the balance between effective protection of society and safeguarding basic human rights.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_143">Ireland has committed €1.8 million in funding for Council of Europe human rights and democratisation projects in Russia and southeast Europe for the years 2002 to 2004. Implementation of these projects is being closely monitored and they are being evaluated by the Department of Foreign Affairs in consultation with the Council.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_144">The Department of Finance is currently preparing the necessary legislation to allow for Ireland's accession to the Council of Europe Development Bank. Recent Council of Europe meetings in Ireland have included a seminar on the charter of local self-government organised in Dublin Castle last month for representatives of local authorities by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. A meeting of Council of Europe specialists on issues relating to Roma and travellers was held in Dublin on 14-16 October. This week, the Human Rights Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission are jointly hosting meetings in Dublin and Belfast for the national human rights institutions of the Council of Europe member states.</summary>

In the case of Denmark and Sweden, the Deputy may be aware that the Governments in both countries have pledged to hold referenda on the issue in the near future. It would be inappropriate, I believe, to make any comment at this stage that might be interpreted as an intervention in the debate on euro-accession in either country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1246">Ireland values the role of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, as the primary instrument for early warning, conflict prevention, conflict management and post-conflict rehabilitation in its geographical area from Vancouver to Vladivostok. We support its comprehensive and co-operative approach to security; its promotion of human rights, its protection of national minorities and its role, as a regional arrangement under the UN charter, in helping to prevent, contain and resolve conflict. We attach particular importance to the OSCEs inclusiveness, with 55 states from Europe, North America, the Caucasus and central Asia participating on the basis of full equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247">The organisation has a network of 19 missions working in the Balkans, eastern Europe and central Asia. While no two missions are the same, generally speaking the objectives of their mandates are twofold: to facilitate the political processes that are intended to prevent or settle conflicts and to ensure that the OSCE community is kept informed of developments in the countries where missions are present. Ireland makes a significant contribution by providing 28 civilian, military and Garda personnel to the missions in Kosovo, Bosnia, Croatia, Former Republic of Yugoslavia, FRY, Skopje, Albania and Georgia.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">The OSCE has been a crucial element in the international community's response to conflicts in the Balkans and continues to play a major role in the efforts to achieve stability, peace and democracy in the region. As the situation there stabilises, Ireland agrees that the time is now opportune to focus more attention on OSCE activities in the Caucasus and central Asia. Ireland endorses the mediation role of the OSCE in the so-called "frozen conflicts" in Moldova-Transdniestra and Nagorno Karabkh. We welcome the organisation's increasing presence in central Asia in recognition of the need to promote human rights and the democratisation process and to encourage economic development. We support current initiatives aimed at enhancing EU-OSCE cooperation in the region.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_145">The terrorist attacks against the United States on 11 September reinforced the OSCE's determination to make full use of all its instruments and  mechanisms in the field of co-operative security to participate in a global coalition against terrorism. Participating states, including Ireland, elaborated a detailed plan of action to combat terrorism at the ministerial council meeting which took place in Bucharest on 3 and 4 December 2001.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_146">I am scheduled to attend the annual meeting of the ministerial council on 6 and 7 December in Porto – Portugal – when participating states will adopt a charter on terrorism. A priority for Ireland will be ensure that concern for human rights and good governance is not set aside in the fight against terrorism. Ireland is of the view that actions to combat terrorism must remain consistent with the demands of democracy, human rights and the rule of law and we fully support the important role which the OSCE is playing to promote and defend these values.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1250">Following the start of Irelands participation in Partnership for Peace on 1 December 1999, the bilateral ambassador to Belgium was designated as head of a liaison mission between Ireland and NATO. This assignment was facilitated by the presentation document of Ireland for Partnership for Peace, approved by Dáil Éireann in November 1999, which provides for the appointment of "representatives to the NATO Headquarters in Brussels". The assignment of the bilateral Ambassador to Belgium to this role is in keeping with the practice of the other neutral and non-aligned participants in Partnership for Peace, namely Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.</p>

          <p eId="para_1255">There has been no reduction in the overall aid budget. In fact the total aid budget for 2002 is at an unprecedented level representing 0.41% of gross national income, GNI, showing an increase of €100 million over 2001. One of the realities of developing countries is that weak governance goes hand in hand with poverty. The goals of the Ireland Aid programme in these countries include the strengthening of systems of governance, the eradication of corruption, the encouragement of respect for rights and the building of accountable public services. Problems of weak governance and corruption must be tackled squarely as development challenges in their own right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">The recent Ireland Aid review emphasised the centrality of the promotion of good governance by recommending that this be treated as a crosscutting issue for the programme. In other words, every proposal for assistance must be evaluated not only in terms of its stated aim but also in the context of the degree to which it promotes good governance. The review also stressed the importance of oversight and accountability. Our programmes in the six priority countries – Lesotho, Mozambique, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia – and in South Africa are subject to annual external audit by reputable firms of accountants. The aid interventions, the programmes and projects which form part of the overall programme in each of these countries are themselves audited. In addition, the internal audit unit of Ireland Aid carries out a series of internal audit examinations of elements of the programme and of the systems for its protection.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_147">Added to that, Ireland Aid is at an advanced stage in introducing a new system of risk management for the bilateral programme. Just as important as the process of accounting for  expended funds is the need to ensure value for money. In that regard, Ireland Aid carries out a programme of evaluations each year, which assess the effectiveness of our programmes. These evaluations inform the whole process of development across the programme. They make recommendations for improvements in the area evaluated and outline lessons for other parts of the programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_148">The paramount objective of the Ireland Aid programme is to get aid to those who need it most. Our procedures and systems are designed with this in mind and are consistently updated and improved. We are committed to the welfare of some of the world's poorest people and to ensuring sustainable development in the countries in which they live. As this involves dealing with weak systems of governance, there is necessarily a degree of risk to be incurred. Careful risk management and the highest levels of vigilance and accountability in the administration of the programme will continue to be central to the work of Ireland Aid. I would be happy to meet the individual named by the Deputy, whose work I much admire, for a discussion of these issues.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1258">In March last, the Dalai Lama sent a letter to the EU Presidency, and to foreign Ministers of the member states, asking the EU to appoint an EU special representative to Tibet. The EU discussed and replied with a joint response. It was decided not to make such an appointment as it was felt that any EU representative would be unable to contribute effectively to the situation in Tibet without Chinese support. The Deputy will be aware that the Government, in our bilateral contacts with China and through the European Union, has consistently called on the Chinese Government to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama, and to respect fully the rights of the Tibetan people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">The Taoiseach raised the situation in Tibet during his meeting with the Chinese Premier, Mr. Zhu, in Dublin, in September 2001, and called for a dialogue between the affected parties with a view to overcoming the impasse. I reiterated this position during my meeting in Beijing with my Chinese counterpart, Minister Tang, last January. I highlighted, in particular, the level of concern in Ireland in relation to Tibet, and strongly encouraged the Chinese authorities to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama on issues of concern.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_149">Ireland also pursues the issue of Tibet through the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which has proven to be a most effective fora in which  to raise human rights issues of concern with the Chinese authorities. At the human rights dialogue session last March, the EU raised its concern about the situation in Tibet in the context of the political and cultural rights of minorities. The EU raised, in particular, the detention of monks, the closure of monasteries, and discrimination in population control policies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_150">These issues were also raised at the 58th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva this year. In its statement on the human rights situation worldwide, the EU highlighted the situation in China, and in Tibet in particular. Since then, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, met Mrs. Kesang Takla, the London-based representative of the Dalai Lama, who briefed him on the current situation in Tibet.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_151">Last month, I was pleased to hear of the positive reception of two special envoys of the Dalai Lama who visited Beijing and Tibet. The purpose of their visit was to explain the Dalai Lamas proposal for a middle way and to allay Chinese concerns that this would promote Tibetan secession from China. The head of the Dalai Lamas delegation said in a statement that he had been impressed by the greater flexibility in attitude displayed by the current Chinese leaders. The Dalai Lama welcomed the positive gesture of the leadership in Beijing in receiving the delegation, and was very pleased that a renewed contact had been established. For our part, I hope that this visit will pave the way for direct dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama, leading to a peaceful and lasting solution to the Tibetan question.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_152">Ingrid Betancourt is one of many kidnap victims – politicians and others – of the FARC terrorist group in Colombia. President Uribe has indicated that he is pursuing what he has called "imaginative ideas" for the release of the kidnap  victims. It is very much to be hoped that these avenues may soon bring a positive outcome.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_153">San Vicente del Caguan is the municipality at the centre of the "clearance zone" ceded by the former Colombian Government to the FARC in November 1998 to facilitate peace negotiations which came to an end in February 2OO2 when the FARC were obliged to leave the zone. In a report last month, Amnesty International pointed out that "although the human rights situation in San Vincente del Caguan is not as severe as in other parts of the country . . .  the situation could deteriorate."  The report makes a series of recommendations to the Colombian Government, to the FARC and to the international community. The two recommendations specifically addressed to the international community are:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_154">Foreign governments, especially the "friendly countries" and intergovernmental organisations, which played an active role in the peace process, should develop a coherent strategy for closely monitoring the human rights situation and the impact of the new Colombian government's policies and its progress in adopting measures which are in line with the recommendations of the UN and other international organisations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_155">The international community must increase its in situ monitoring of the human rights situation in San Vicente del Caguan and the other municipalities of the former DMZ and support mechanisms complementary to the work of the UN Office in Colombia to ensure greater in situ monitoring.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_156">Ireland and our EU partners are taking these recommendations into account in the examination of how best we may be able to assist in advancing progress towards a peaceful outcome in Colombia based inter alia on increased respect for human rights.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_157">Ireland and the EU attach great importance to the commitment by President Uribe to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict. He has called for a cessation of violence by the illegal armed groups in order to enable talks to commence. We will support such talks as the only way of bringing about a lasting peace, and we welcome President Uribe's invitation to the UN to play a central facilitating role.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_158">Ireland and the EU will also support the Colombian government and people in meeting the daunting array of challenges – political, economic and social – which face them. We welcome President Uribe's commitment to meet these challenges, including those posed by terrorism and drug trafficking – with full respect for the principles of democracy, for human rights and for the rule of law.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1270">Ireland is supporting the work of the UN Fund for Population Activities, UNFPA, to help them extend assistance to developing countries in order to assist in dealing with such development challenges as maternal and infant mortality, HIV-AIDS and maternal reproductive healthcare. In 2002, Ireland contributed €1.84 million to the UNFPA in support of its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">Recent reports by the Population Research Institute, a private US body, have alleged that UNFPA supports the Chinese Governments one child policy. There have been a number of US Congressional hearings on the basis of these reports. Two separate recent investigations by independent teams, commissioned by UNFPA itself and by the British parliament, examined UNFPAs activities in China in detail and both came to the same conclusion that the fund is working to encourage China away from coercive policies and is not involved in supporting a one-child policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">However, despite the two independent investigations, the US administration decided to carry out its own fact-finding mission to China. This mission, which reported in May 2002, also found no support for the allegations made by the Population Research Institute. The report of the mission, addressed to Secretary of State Colin Powell, stated that the mission found "no evidence that UNFPA has knowingly supported or participated in the management of a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation in China" and therefore recommended that the $34 million which has already been appropriated be released to UNFPA.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_162">In the event, the US administration did not accept the recommendation of the investigation team and decided to withhold its financial support from UNFPA. This decision was taken by the State Department which voiced concern, inter alia, that it was possible that some of UNFPAs activities, such as the funding of computers, might unwittingly be used to support Chinas coercive policies. The UNFPA has vehemently denied this possibility and no investigation to date has found any evidence that this is the case.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_163">The EU is currently engaged in dialogue with the US on its decision to withhold its funding from UNFPA and on the background to its decision. At the EU Development Council in May 2002, EU member states reaffirmed the importance of the role of UNFPA in reaching the millennium development goals in the areas of infant, child and maternal mortality and restated the EUs firm commitment to continue to support the Fund. The commission has allocated an additional €20 million to UNFPA.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_164">In the context of the findings of these various independent investigations and from our own bilateral contacts with the fund, the Irish Government believes that UNFPA abides by its mandate in all of the countries in which it operates, including China. We are also satisfied that it is playing an important role, particularly in Africa, in helping some of the worlds poorest countries to fight HIV/AIDS and to deal with the challenges of maternal and infant mortality.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1274">The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair, during their meeting in Downing Street on 9 October, at which I was also present, spoke about the PSNI raids in north and west Belfast and at Stormont on Friday, 4 October.

The televisual images of a large dispatch of armed police entering Stormont caused considerable concern within the Nationalist community. This was recognised by the new  chief constable of the police service. As the Taoiseach told the Dáil on 22 October, "we were glad to see the change of attitude, which would not have happened in the past, when Chief Constable Orde made an apology for the way the raid was carried out". At the time, we also stressed that it was important there be no rush to judgment. The matter is now before the courts in Northern Ireland, and the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate to comment further on the matter.</summary>

The ASEM process is still relatively new, having been formally established in 1996 in Bangkok. The meeting was divided into three working sessions, one for each main pillar of co-operation: political dialogue, economic co-operation; and social, cultural and educational issues. The Taoiseach spoke on lifelong learning in the third session. There was also a new feature in the fourth summit, an informal discussion on cultures and civilisations.</p>

          <p eId="para_1280">I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 133  together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">The British proposal to establish an independent mechanism to monitor paramilitary ceasefires has been discussed with the British Government through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. The British side have advised that no decisions have been reached on this matter, including in regard to a nominee to carry out the role of independent monitor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">During early deliberations on this question, the Government raised a number of questions about the nature of the proposed operation of the audit mechanism, its remit, resources to be made available to it, and potential candidates. Since then the context has changed considerably with the suspension of the institutions on 14 October and shortly thereafter the appointment of a new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">What has not changed is the position regarding any assessment of the ceasefires: it remains the duty of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. We are confident that the new Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, will perform this task as his predecessors did, making a sound judgment in the round based on all the relevant facts and factors in accordance with the statutory requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">The Irish Governments position is clear: all traces of paramilitarism must be removed from society in Northern Ireland. The continuation of ceasefires declared by paramilitary organisations has made, and continues to make, a major contribution to the progress of recent years. The two acts of decommissioning by the IRA were very significant and welcome developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">We share the view of the British Government that the Sinn Féin leadership is totally committed to the peace process. However, the necessary transition from paramilitarism to peace and democracy must proceed apace. How this transition can be completed will be a key issue – and a major challenge – in the forthcoming talks aimed at surmounting the current impasse in the peace process.</p>

          <p eId="para_1288">This year so far has been the first in over a decade without violent conflict in the western Balkans. Democratic elections have been held in recent months in most of the countries of the region. General elections were held in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia on 15 September. They were the first elections since the Ohrid peace agreement of August 2002 and resulted in the  peaceful transfer of power to a new coalition Government. I welcome the formation of the new Government, led by Prime Minister Crvenkovski, which was sworn in on 1 November. It comprises the pan-Slav SDSM coalition and the majority Albanian party, the DUI, which is the political wing of the former rebel National Liberation Army.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">Elections at presidential, parliamentary, and cantonal levels were held in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 5 October. These were the first elections to have been organised by the Bosnian authorities themselves since independence. It is also the first time since the Dayton Agreement that those elected have received mandates valid for a four year term. Voter turnout was lower than had been hoped for, and this has been widely interpreted as an indication of popular dissatisfaction with the slow pace of the reform process. Because of the complexity of the political arrangements for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the process of government formation is ongoing. I would hope that governments can be formed at all levels in the country in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">Elections in Montenegro on 20 October took place without incident and resulted in the re-election of the outgoing Government led by President Djukanovic. The result is seen as supporting the Governments negotiating position on Montenegro's place within the proposed new state union of Serbia and Montenegro, which is due to succeed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Municipal elections were held in Kosovo on 26 October. They are generally regarded as having been successful, except for the disappointingly low turn-out by the minority Serb community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">Presidential elections in Serbia have not reached a conclusion but agreement has been reached between the parties to allow a rerun on 8 December. The second round of the elections, on 13 October, was invalidated because of the low turnout of 45.5%. The electoral law stipulated that at least 50% of the registered electorate must vote for the result to be valid. The current President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Vojislav Kostunica, won around 67% of ballots cast in the now-invalidated poll. I welcome the agreement which makes new elections possible. It is important for the stability of the country, and of the wider region, that the process be completed successfully.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">Overall, it is a positive development that all of the elections across the region were conducted in accordance with international standards. The results have been seen generally as underlining the support of the people of the countries of the region for greater progress in the political and economic reform process. I am pleased that Ireland contributed to this process through the provision of monitors for the elections in each of the countries and territories I have mentioned.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_169">On 30 October, the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Mr. Goran Svilanovic, visited Dublin for discussions on developments in his country and in the wider  region. I expressed our appreciation of the progress made by his government in the internal reform process and towards the reintegration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the international community. We discussed in particular the importance of reaching agreement in the delayed negotiations on the constitutional charter for the new state union of Serbia and Montenegro. I also stressed Irelands support for the work of the international tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the obligation on all countries concerned to cooperate fully with the tribunal. The president of the tribunal last month wrote to the UN Security Council to complain that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has not been providing full cooperation. The Government of Croatia is also under pressure from the international community to improve the level of its cooperation with the tribunal.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_170">The situation in Kosovo remains perhaps the most uncertain in the region. However, some progress is being made towards the achievement of a multi-ethnic Kosovo, in line with the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 1244. I welcome the establishment of the provisional institutions of self-government in February this year. Ireland wholeheartedly supports the activities of the UN mission in Kosovo, led by the special representative of the Secretary General, Mr. Michael Steiner. Ireland participates in the UN Force, KFOR, which plays an essential role in guaranteeing the security of ethnic minorities in Kosovo.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_171">In recent weeks, a number of investigations have been undertaken into reports of illegal arms sales to Iraq and Liberia from Bosnia and Herzegovina, specifically from its Serb entity, Republika Srpska, and from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. A number of senior figures have already been dismissed and the authorities have stated their commitment to further action when the investigations have been completed. These developments underline the urgent need to pursue the reform process and to establish civilian control of the military in both countries.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_172">It is a central priority of the European Union to continue to work closely with the governments and the people of the region to establish stability, prosperity and respect for human rights and the rule of law throughout the western Balkans. Organised crime and corruption remain serious problems throughout the western Balkans. The conference on organised crime in southeastern Europe, which will take place in London on 25 November, will provide an important political message on the need for improved coordination of action against organised crime within and emanating from the Western Balkan region. The conference will be led by the EU and will involve all of the governments of southeastern Europe.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_173">I hope that it will result in improved cooperation in the fight against organised crime and in a full recognition of their responsibilities by the Governments of the region. This problem must be tackled urgently and effectively if it is not to  undermine the reform and stability of the Western Balkans region.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1294">The Government attaches great importance to strengthening the role of the Oireachtas in relation to scrutinising the Governments approach to EU negotiations, including the development of EU legislation that affects the Irish people. For that reason, the Government earlier this year introduced significantly enhanced arrangements for Oireachtas scrutiny of EU business. The main elements of these arrangements have been put on a legislative basis in the EU (Scrutiny) Act, 2002, which became law last month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">These improvements are important for their own sake to increase accountability and transparency. They are one of the factors which accounted for the positive outcome in the second referendum on the Nice treaty and will continue to be an important factor in a positive and informed public response to Irelands membership of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">Clearly, all Oireachtas committees, including the European affairs committee, need to be adequately resourced. The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Finance is currently before the Dáil with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill, 2002. This provides for the establishment of an Oireachtas commission which will have responsibility for the management of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas and will provide for a three year budget for the office to be drawn on the central fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">Pending the establishment of the Oireachtas commission and in the context of staffing arrangements put in place by the Oireachtas, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs have each allocated one officer, at assistant principal level, to facilitate the work of the European affairs committee. Another officer from my Department continues to act as a senior policy advisor to the European affairs committee and the foreign affairs committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_1299">I assume the Deputy is referring to the rapid reaction mechanism established under Council Regulation No. 381/2001 of 26 February 2001. As is stated in article 1 of the regulation, the mechan ism is designed to allow the community to respond in a rapid, efficient and flexible manner to situations of urgency or crisis or to the emergence of crisis. It operates from a designated list of existing Community instruments and enhances the EUs civilian crisis management capacity by allowing resources to be released more quickly than would otherwise be possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">The instruments in question seek to alleviate crises through, <i>inter alia</i>, election monitoring, institution building, humanitarian missions, police training and the provision of police equipment, civil emergency assistance, rehabilitation, and mediation. The mechanism operates primarily under the auspices of the European Commission and the specified implementation period for activities within its remit is six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">Since its inception, the rapid reaction mechanism has so far contributed to overall EU responses to crises in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as allowing several Commission-led conflict prevention assessment missions to take place.

      asked the

      if he will make a statement on the situation with regard to the connection between the trade in diamonds and the flagrant abuse of human rights in a number of African countries, in particular the Democratic Republic of Congo.

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1305">The trade in diamonds and other natural resources has been linked to the continuation of conflict and the perpetration of human rights abuses in a number of African countries. While diamonds are rarely the sole cause, or even an initial cause, of conflicts in Africa, it is indisputable that both official and rebel armies consider the control of mineral-rich areas as a critical factor in conflicts. The exploitation of the resources can fund the acquisition of arms and, if the conflict endures, resource exploitation can become the primary interest of those who control them.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_174">It has been established, for example, that control of diamond fields in Sierra Leone by the rebel RUF army prolonged a decade-long conflict which was synonymous with gross human rights abuses. The United Nations Security Council has recognised the link between diamonds and the continuation of conflicts by passing resolutions on Sierra Leone, Liberia and Angola which attempt  to ensure that conflict or "blood" diamonds are not used as a source of war finance. The conflicts in these African countries are a key focus of the humanitarian aid provided each year by the Government through the Ireland Aid emergency relief and recovery assistance programmes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_175">An extensive examination of the link between the illegal exploitation of diamonds and other natural resources and the continuation of conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC, has been carried out by a panel of experts appointed by the UN Secretary General at the request of the UN Security Council. The final report of the panel of experts, which was published last month, highlights the deeply troubling fact that the humanitarian situation in the DRC is at a critical level in areas where illegal exploitation of natural resources is carried out. The principal parties to the conflict have been implicated in the exploitation of natural resources, including diamonds, either to fund their war effort or to line the pockets of key political, business and military people. The illegal exploitation of resources has also been directly linked to human rights abuses in the DRC.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_176">The task now for the international community is to sever the link between the exploitation of resources and the continuation of conflict in the DRC, and to this end the panel of experts report makes a number of recommendations. At a public meeting of the UN Security Council on 5 November 2002 to discuss the report, Ireland supported the panels recommendations, including those on the need to provide incentives for countries which cease the illegal exploitation of resources and adhere to the peace agreements they have signed, and, conversely, the need for sanctions on individuals, companies and countries which do not cease such exploitation and/or do not adhere to the various peace agreements they have signed. We have also supported the establishment of a mechanism to monitor the exploitation of the DRCs resources on an on-going basis in a bid to discourage those who would seek to continue conflict for personal gain.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_177">While the UN Security Council has attempted to sever the link between diamonds and conflict through Security Council resolutions on individual conflict situations, it has long been recognised that a global approach is needed. At the initiative of African diamond producing countries in particular, producer and trading countries, industry and civil society have met in the "Kimberley process" to design an international certification system for rough diamonds. This process is directed at countries that produce, export and import rough diamonds.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_178">Ministers and representatives of more than 50 countries, including Ireland, launched the internationally agreed Kimberly process certification scheme for rough diamonds through a joint declaration made at a special meeting in Interlaken, Switzerland, on 5 November. Under the Interlaken declaration Ireland and other participating countries have committed themselves to  the simultaneous launch of the certification scheme beginning on 1 January 2003. An EU regulation to establish a community system of certification for the purposes of implementing the certification scheme is being finalised. It is our sincere hope that with the help of these measures the wealth generated in countries holding rich diamond resources can be redirected from conflict towards development programmes and the provision of basic health, water, sanitation, education and other services for their vulnerable people.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1307">In the Westminster legislation establishing the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, a review clause was included under which the commission would make a report to the Secretary of State after two years, setting out recommendations on its effectiveness; the adequacy and effectiveness of its functions; and the adequacy and effectiveness of the Acts provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">The commission was established in March 1999 and submitted its report to the Secretary of State in March 2001. The British Government published its draft response in May 2002, which was open to consultation until 16 August 2002. The British Government is currently considering its response to that consultation exercise. The Government has discussed this matter with the British Government through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, and put forward a detailed submission on its views in August 2002. In addition, I raised the broad area of human rights with the former Secretary of State, Dr Reid, at the last meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 22 October. We have made clear our view that the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission should fully comply with the UN principles relating to the status and functioning of national institutions for the protection and promotion of human rights – Paris principles. These principles outline internationally approved standards for the status of national human rights institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">I have noted the concerns expressed by some former members of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission regarding its powers and resources and have scheduled a meeting with them in the near future to discuss these issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_1311">The Government remains concerned about the situation in West Papua and, in particular, the human rights situation. I am also very aware of the outstanding questions about the circumstances surrounding the 1969 Act of Free Choice in Irian Jaya. As I stated previously, Ireland was not a party to the 1969 Act and it is not within the Governments power to re-examine the outcome of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">The question of a possible UN review of the issue would be a matter for the UN secretariat and for the UN Secretary General. Procedurally, re-opening the issue would require the support of UN member states, and our mission to the UN informs me that, at present, there appears to be no significant support for this. Furthermore, there is concern that such a review might prejudice ongoing efforts to initiate a meaningful dialogue with the Government authorities in Jakarta and would not contribute to the amelioration of the current situation of the West Papuan people. In this respect a primary concern of the Government are the reports of ongoing human rights abuses in Papua and, in particular, allegations of military and police involvement in such violations. The EU is developing a political dialogue with the Indonesian Government. This includes human rights as an important area for discussion. In this regard, a team of EU ambassadors visited Papua in March of this year and, while there, they met with leading human rights groups, representatives of the Catholic and Protestant churches, members of the Papua Presidium Council, tribal leaders, as well as Government representatives and military commanders. We very much hope that this dialogue will grow and develop.</p>

          <p eId="para_1315">Ireland is currently party to five of the 12 universal conventions relating to terrorism:</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_180">– Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, 1963;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_181">– Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, 1970;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_182">– Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, 1971;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_183">– Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials, 1980; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_184">– Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Aviation, complementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, 1988.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_185">Ireland has also signed, subject to ratification, the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, 1997, and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 1999.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_186">Following 11 September and the adoption of UN Security Council Resolutions 1368 and 1373, the question of ratification of the outstanding seven conventions was prioritised. It was concluded that Ireland may become party to one of the outstanding conventions, the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, 1991, without primary legislation. Dáil approval is to be sought for the terms of the convention, in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution. On 17 October the proposal was referred to the select committee on foreign affairs for its consideration. The Government hopes that the committee will deal with this matter promptly and, subject to Dáil approval, would intend to deposit the instrument of accession before Christmas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_187">All six of the remaining conventions contain provisions which require the introduction of primary legislation before Ireland may become a party. The Government's legislative programme, published on 7 October, highlights the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill, 2002, as one of 15 bills for publication before the Christmas recess. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, hopes to publish the bill within that time-frame and its enactment would permit the Government to immediately make arrangements for Ireland to become a party to the following four outstanding conventions:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_188">– Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents, 1973;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_189">– International Convention against the Taking of Hostages, 1979;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_190">– International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, 1997; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_191">– International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 1999.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_192">The Government's legislative programme also includes a suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of maritime navigation and offshore  fixed platforms Bill, which is being advanced by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. This Bill is expected to be published in early 2003 and its enactment would permit ratification of the final two conventions:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_193">– Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, 1988;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_194">– Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms on the Continental Shelf, 1988.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1353">The defence working group was established as part of the "second wave" of working groups of the convention. It has so far met six times.

          <p eId="para_1354">Membership of convention working groups is drawn from representatives of Governments, national parliaments and members of the European Parliament. Deputy Gormley and Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, are both parliamentary members of the defence working group, which is chaired by the regional policy commissioner, Michel Barnier, who is a member of the praesidium of the convention. The Government is not represented on this group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">There will a further three meetings of this working group, including one joint session with the external action working group, before it produces a report. It is expected that this report will be considered by the plenary of the convention in December. Given the complex nature of the issue involved it seems unlikely that the group will be able to arrive at clear recommendations. Documents submitted to the defence working group are available on the convention website.</p>

          <p eId="para_1364">The Government is actively responding to the growing food security crisis in the Horn of Africa region, both bilaterally and with our partners in the EU and the United Nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">Recent assessments by the United Nations' World Food Programme and the European Commission Humanitarian Office have revealed widespread losses of maize and sorghum crops, the staple foods for most rural people in the Horn of Africa region, due mainly to poor rainfall. As a consequence at least 12 million people are threatened with famine in the Horn of Africa region. Coupled with the food security crisis already taking hold in Southern Africa, the grim forecast is that more than 26 million African people will require food assistance over the next eight months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366">The alleviation of poverty in Africa was one of the central themes addressed by Ireland at the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development last September. In his address to the summit the Taoiseach highlighted the food security crisis threatening Africa and the need for an urgent international response.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">The Minister of State with special responsibility for overseas development assistance, Deputy Tom Kitt, raised the crisis in the Horn of Africa in discussions he had with World Bank and UN agency representatives during a visit to Washington and New York last week. Last July Deputy Kitt met the EU Commissioner Poul Nielson in Brussels for discussions on EU action in response to a number of food crises in Africa. Ireland Aid has also been working closely at official level with partners in the EU and the United Nations to develop strategies on how immediate food needs across the Horn of Africa may best be addressed at both the national and regional levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368">At the bilateral level, Ireland Aid has delivered over €3.5 million in emergency humanitarian relief to the Horn of Africa region to date this year. On 22 October a special €1 million emergency food aid package for Ethiopia, the country worst affected in the region, was announced by my Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. It is anticipated that this funding will be allocated in the coming weeks to key international agencies providing food and other essential humanitarian assistance, as well as to Irish non-governmental organisations operating on the ground. Deputy Kitt will work closely with Irish NGOs in the preparation of Ireland's response to this crisis.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_197">In Ethiopia, in addition to emergency humanitarian assistance, Ireland Aid is delivering long-term development support with an emphasis on poverty reduction through the provision of basic needs and capacity building support. Food security needs are addressed as part of this approach. Ireland Aid is supporting a new programme of operational research in agriculture, which brings  together a number of Ethiopian and foreign centres of expertise to look at policy, strategy and specific interventions that will enhance efforts to meet food security needs in the Tigray and southern regions of Ethiopia, areas which are affected by chronic food insecurity.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1372">The President of Nigeria, His Excellency Olusegun Obasanjo, paid a State visit to Ireland in June. It was the first visit to Ireland by a Nigerian head of state and was a welcome opportunity to discuss issues of common interest between our two countries. President Obasanjo was accompanied on his visit by his Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Science and Technology, Education and Power and Steel, and his national security adviser. This provided scope for a wide range of discussions, including topics such as business relations, human rights and immigration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">Deputies will be aware of the widespread concern at the death sentence, by stoning, imposed on a woman accused of adultery. The concern of the Government and the people of Ireland was conveyed to the Nigerian embassy in Dublin by my Department. On 24 August the EU issued a declaration expressing its deep concern regarding the sentence which was handed down by a Sharia court in northern Nigeria. The Nigerian Federal Government will also be aware of the EU Council conclusions of 30 September which expresses the Union's concern at the continued use of the death penalty world-wide and our abhorrence at the use of particularly cruel forms of punishment, such as stoning. Recently the Nigerian Government said that it will not allow the woman to be executed should her appeal fail.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_199">Last April the EU renewed its common position on Nigeria as an indication of the high priority which the Union attaches to relations with Nigeria. The common position expresses the  EU's intention to maintain a positive, constructive and consistent approach towards Nigeria, and to support it in its efforts to consolidate democracy and advance economic development. The common position identifies key areas for future EU support, including the development of a democratic culture, institutional capacity building and poverty reduction.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_200">Arising from the common position, Nigeria and the EU are engaged in an ongoing political dialogue. On 11 June a meeting in Abuja was held under the framework of the dialogue discussed,inter alia, human rights, corruption and European Development Funding. The EU has committed funds of €552 million in the period to 2006. Ireland Aid has expended more than €4 million on development co-operation projects in Nigeria in the period 1997 to 2002. Funding has been focused primarily on addressing basic needs and the alleviation of poverty in sectors such as primary healthcare, basic education, water and sanitation, agriculture and rural development. Ireland Aid expenditure on projects and programmes in Nigeria was more than €610,000 during 2001 and has exceeded €370,000 so far in 2002. Ireland Aid's human rights and democratisation budget line has contributed funding of over €53,000 to a legal aid programme run by Trócaire. Its support to Nigeria evolved from the presence of Irish missionaries and funding continues to be channelled through NGOs and missionary orders in Nigeria.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_201">Last May saw the publication of the report of the Human Rights Violations Investigation Panel, commonly known as the Oputa panel, which had been set up by President Obasanjo in 1999 to investigate human rights abuses under previous military regimes. The panel's report runs to 30,000 pages and has been praised by President Obasanjo, who has promised to act on its recommendations. The Government has established steering and co-ordination committees for the national action plan for human rights. The committees are expected to assess, report on and make recommendations in relation to human rights in Nigeria.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_202">In October the International Court of Justice ruled that Nigeria should cede the disputed Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon. The UN has called on both countries to accept the decision of the ICJ and for Nigeria to withdraw its troops from the peninsula. Together, with our EU partners, we are closely monitoring Nigeria's response to this ruling.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_203">Presidential elections are due to be held in Nigeria in 2003, most likely in April. The Nigerian authorities have stated that international observers will be welcome. We expect that the EU will be invited to provide observers in due course. One of the key areas in the EU's common position on Nigeria has been the development and consolidation of democratic reforms. To this end the EU has funded the Nigerian electoral support programme in order to provide civic and voter education; capacity building and training  for domestic election observers; and monitoring and technical assistance to the Independent National Electoral Commission in Nigeria. The EU has provided €6.5 million to the INEC.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1376">Enhanced co-operation can only be used as a last resort when the objectives involved cannot be achieved through any other means within a reasonable period. Any proposal to create an enhanced co-operation project must be endorsed by the Council of Ministers – by QMV or unanimity depending on the area. A group must involve the participation of at least eight member states. It must be open to all of them, both when it is established and at any time thereafter. A project must not undermine the single market, must not be a barrier to free trade and must not distort competition between member states. Enhanced co-operation can never be used in the area of defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">Enhanced co-operation was first provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Treaty of Nice made some adjustments to the procedures involved. There has yet to be a proposal for the creation of an enhanced co-operation project. The Government does not have particular priorities in mind but will examine any proposal on a case by case basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_1389">As a participant in the Partnership for Peace, Ireland also takes part in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. The EAPC is the political structure which acts as an important forum for discussions in the broad Euro-Atlantic area on matters such as the future development of peacekeeping as well as on non-military areas of possible co-operation, such as disaster relief in Europe. Grounded in the basic principles of the UN Charter and the OSCE basic documents, its work complements and reinforces the work of other international organisations.</p>

          <p eId="para_1391">Since joining PfP and the EAPC in December 1999, Ireland has been represented at ministerial level at the separate six monthly meetings of Foreign and Defence Ministers from the EAPC countries. The EAPC meeting is quite separate from the NATO summit that is taking place on the previous day. Representatives from 46 countries are invited to participate in the EAPC meeting, including representatives from other European neutral and non-aligned countries, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">The EAPC meeting in Prague is expected to focus on the future direction of PfP and of the EAPC in the twenty-first century. Attendance by Ireland at the meeting will help to facilitate the development of practical co-operation between EAPC participants in the peacekeeping area. This already takes place in a UN mandated context in Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Irish personnel participate alongside NATO and non-NATO troop contingents as part of the KFOR and SFOR missions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393">Ireland's attendance at the Prague meeting is in keeping with the terms of Irish participation in the EAPC as set out in the presentation document of Ireland for PfP. These terms were approved by this House in November 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394">The presentation document stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that Ireland's participation in PfP is in full accordance with Ireland's policy of military neutrality which has always been pursued in tandem with full and active support for collective security, based on international law.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_207">Our priorities for PfP membership remain focused on co-operation in relation to peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. In this context the EAPC provides a forum whereby we can pursue our priorities on the basis of terms we ourselves have established. The EAPC also facilitates lreland's support for ongoing work in areas such as conflict prevention, civil emergency planning, global humanitarian action against mines and the challenge posed by the illicit transfer of small arms.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1397">Negotiations have already commenced in earnest across a broad range of issues. A substantial WTO negotiating structure is now in place including, at its pinnacle, the trade negotiation committee designed to drive the Doha development agenda. The role of the TNC is to supervise the progress of the negotiations across the full spectrum including, in relation to trade related issues in the areas of agriculture, services, trade related intellectual property rights, dispute settlement and trade and development. The European communities and its member states are contributing substantially to the delivery of key outputs under the Doha work programme.

Issues of importance to Ireland under the current round are the conclusion of a successful round of negotiations in the areas of agriculture, services, market access and strengthening the influence and outcomes for developing countries in the multilateral trading environment.

          <p eId="para_1400">The statement of affairs produced by the board of IFI at the creditors meeting on 8 November showed an overall deficiency of €44.8 million. When account is taken of the agreement, in principle, by the shareholders to subordinate loans of €34.5 million the actual deficiency for unsecured creditors, other than the shareholders, on the basis of this statement amounts to more than €10 million. This suggests that the creditors would receive a dividend of nearly 75% of what they are owed by the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_1401">The actual position can be determined with certainty only when the assets of the company are realised but there are indications that the values assumed for the assets by the directors may prove to be somewhat conservative. Earlier estimates of the value of the land owned by the company were considerably higher and would have been more than sufficient to cover the €10 million deficiency. Thus, the prospects for creditors to be paid in full will largely depend on which valuation is proven correct in due course. I expect the liquidator will proceed with the liquidation in an efficient and effective manner with a view to meeting the obligations to creditors to the maximum extent possible.</p>

Such a practice, if it exists, is not illegal as potatoes are not covered by the terms of the Groceries Order, 1987.

The success of the economy over the past decade and the aspirations for the future means that the focus of the agency is more strongly than ever on increasing job quality. Ireland is no longer a competitive location for low wage basis manufacturing projects. The focus now and for the future must be on attracting investment requiring high skill levels, that is, as far as possible, innovation rather than production orientated, and that links to an increasingly sophisticated business environment. Only economic activities with these characteristics can justify high wage levels and so allow us to maintain economic growth in the absence of the strong labour surplus we had up until recently.</summary>

To enable his application to be processed for payment a Form EP250 was sent to him seeking details of any losses incurred during the retention period. The form was returned indicating that six ewes had died during the retention period and were sent to the knackery for disposal. Under the terms and conditions of the scheme flockowners are obliged to notify the local office in writing within ten days of discovery of any losses relating to their flock. However, the person named did not notify the local office about the losses as he thought that the knackery would notify the Department. Consequently on 27 June 2002 he was asked to submit documentary evidence to show that the six ewes had been disposed of through the knackery. This evidence would result in payment on all ewes. There is no record of him having replied to date. A reminder has now issued to the person named and as soon as the information requested is submitted his application will be processed for payment.</p>

Since demand for reserve quota exceeded that figure, there were not enough rights available to satisfy all applicants. Consequently, quota had to be distributed in accordance with the priorities laid down by the Quota Review Group and EU regulations as follows: 5% of the reserve had to be reserved for Category B applicants – farmers with holdings on offshore islands; 10% of the reserve had to be reserved for Category C applicants – organic farmers; and the remaining quota was distributed to qualifying applicants under Category A – first time applicants under 35 years of age who, under EU rules, had to be given priority.</p>

          <p eId="para_1462">Following the imposition of the EU wide ban on the exportation of cattle from the UK in March 1996, Ireland introduced a ban on the importation of such cattle.

          <p eId="para_1489">I am not aware of any decision by An Post not to renew some lottery agent contracts, as stated in the Deputy's question. The Deputy may be referring to a recently publicised decision by the An Post National Lottery Company to downgrade some 60 lotto terminals countrywide as part of an overall restructuring of the lotto terminal network.</p>
          <p eId="para_1490">In January of this year the company carried out a review of its terminal network. At that time there were approximately 2,000 lotto terminals and 1,500 "instant only" or "scratch card" terminals installed. In conducting this review they looked at the sales levels of each of their existing terminals and they also took into account the changing retail environment since these terminals were first installed. As a result of this, the company decided to do a root and branch job of replacing the entire terminal base of 3,500 between now and Christmas in order to reflect the findings of the review. In doing this it decided to use the opportunity to improve the service levels to the player base by changing the machine type provided in certain outlets.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_234">What must be appreciated are the very positive benefits of the company's exercise, which far outweigh any negative consequences. While 60 outlets were downgraded to a certain degree as a result of the review, there are now 400 agents, who previously could sell only scratch cards, who can now offer quick picks for all the on-line games. In addition, a further 100 scratch card agents have been upgraded to full lotto terminals offering the complete product range. So while 60 outlets were downgraded, 500 others were upgraded.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_235">Overall, the situation which will obtain as a result of the lottery's review not only makes commercial sense but will be much more conducive to a wider availability of the full range of lotto services to urban and rural areas.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1500">I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 191 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1501">The Government is actively responding to the grave humanitarian situation now facing the Southern Africa region, both bilaterally and with our partners in the European Union and the United Nations. Recent assessments carried out by the United Nations World Food Programme indicate that over 14 million people in southern Africa will be in need of food assistance by next March. Nearly half of these are in Zimbabwe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502">In response to this food crisis, Ireland Aid, the official aid programme of the Government, has delivered over €8 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance for the affected countries in southern Africa to date this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1503">Bilateral support has been given to key international organisations providing food and other essential aid to the southern Africa region. In July over €1 million was allocated to the WFP and in May €500,000 was provided for the International Federation of the Red Cross in response to its food security appeal. For individual countries in the region, the following amounts have been disbursed to date this year through international agencies and Irish non-governmental organisations operating on the ground: €3 million to Angola; €2 million to Malawi; €250,000 to Zambia; and €1.2 million to Zimbabwe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1504">I stress that, in addition to emergency humanitarian assistance, Ireland Aid is also delivering long-term development support to the region with an emphasis on poverty reduction through the provision of basic needs and capacity building support. In 2002, it is estimated that such support for southern Africa will exceed €80 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1505">The Government's concern at the situation in southern Africa has been underlined by the fact that the Minister of State with special responsibility for overseas development assistance, Deputy Tom Kitt, visited Malawi and Zambia last August and witnessed first hand the devastating effect that famine, drought and HIV/AIDS are having on the people of the region. He also viewed the excellent work being carried out by Irish non-governmental organisations and by missionaries and their local counterparts in seeking to alleviate the worst effects of the crisis.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_237">The WFP country director for Zimbabwe visited Dublin in September and briefed Ireland Aid on the food situation in that country. A senior official from Ireland Aid will this week be travelling to Zimbabwe to meet relevant international organisations, Irish NGOs and missionaries to review Ireland's emergency humanitarian aid activities and to co-ordinate further assistance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_238">Ireland's financial support has been complemented by ongoing political action. The Government has been working closely with its partners in the European Union and United Nations to develop strategies on how immediate food needs across southern Africa may best be addressed at both the national and regional levels.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_239">At the UN level, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, last week met UN Under Secretary General at the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Mr. Kenzo Oshima, to discuss,inter alia, the ongoing response to the humanitarian crises in Africa. In his address to the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg on 3 September 2002, the Taoiseach highlighted the food security crises threatening Africa and the need for an urgent international response. At the summit the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, raised the crisis with EU Development and Environment Ministers and with the administrator of the UN Development Programme. In June 2002, Ireland took part in the special Regional Meeting on Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa hosted jointly by the WFP and OCHA in Johannesburg.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_240">At the EU level, on 30 May 2002, a Declaration on the Food Crisis in Southern Africa was adopted at the EU Development Council in Brussels, at Ireland's initiative. I also raised the matter again in June 2002 with other EU Ministers at the meeting of the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg. On 17 July 2002, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, met Commissioner Poul Nielson, in Brussels for discussions on the crisis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_241">In response to the humanitarian crisis in southern Africa, EU member states and the EU Commission have contributed €310 million as of 16 October. This amount is destined primarily for the hardest hit countries in the region, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi. Of this amount, €177 million is managed directly by the EU Commission and covers 40% of the total needs for this region. Over 90% of the food aid required is being purchased in local and regional markets so as not to disrupt these markets and local eating habits, which is in line with the Food Aid Convention. In May 2002, €32 million in food aid and  €10 million in humanitarian aid was earmarked for Angola by the EU Commission. This contribution is part of a package worth a total of €125 million for Angola.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_242">We will continue to follow the unfolding situation in the southern Africa region carefully and the Government stands prepared to deliver further assistance. In addition, we will work with our donor partners in the EU and the UN to  ensure maximum co-ordination and coherence in the international response to this crisis.</summary>

Due to current economic circumstances, the size of the budget increase for the Ireland Aid programme this year will be €32 million less than originally anticipated and it will not be possible to attain the interim target of 0.45% of GNP. However, the revised allocation of €340 million under Vote 39, the Vote for International Co-operation, represents an increase of over 40% or €100 million on the 2001 allocation. This increase is the largest single annual increase in the history of the programme.</p>

The Taoiseach reconfirmed the Government's clear commitment to this objective at the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. The  scale and timing of the increases in funding required to achieve the 0.7% target will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1514">In response to these observations, the Commission has been making ongoing efforts to modernise and upgrade its internal administration. These include amendments to the financial regulations, drafted with the assistance of the Court of Auditors and adopted by the European Parliament and Council, which will come into effect on 1 January 2003. Efforts to upgrade computer systems are also continuing. It is in the interest of the EU institutions and the member states that best practice is followed in all aspects of EU administration, including financial administration, and these measures are an important step in that direction.</p>

The major component, my Department's Vote for International Co-operation, amounts to €340 million in 2002, while elements of ODA, which are expected to total some €80 million in 2002, are administered by other Departments.

The key focus of the bilateral programme is on a small number of least developed countries, the programme countries, in sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. These are among the poorest countries in the world and receive the brunt of our bilateral assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1528">Country programmes are guided by a three year strategy negotiated with the government of the country concerned. These strategies include specific targets and performance indicators for progress in areas such as primary health, basic education, water and sanitation, agriculture and food security, rural access roads and good governance. Although progress may be slow from time to time in individual sectors, real and substantial progress is being made across the range of areas in which Ireland Aid is active within each country programme. This progress is monitored on an ongoing basis. In addition, the evaluation and audit unit of Ireland Aid undertakes an annual programme of evaluations to assess the effectiveness, sustainability and efficiency of Ireland Aid programmes.</p>

          <p eId="para_1531">In these humanitarian endeavours, Ireland Aid, the official aid programme of the Government, works in close partnership with UN agencies such as the World Food Programme, the UN High Commission for Refugees and UNICEF, with non-governmental organisations such as Concern, GOAL, Trócaire, Oxfam and Christian Aid and with international agencies such as the International Red Cross and Red Crescent family. These partner organisations have a proven capacity to respond quickly and effectively to natural disasters and man-made emergencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1532">In 2001, Ireland Aid assisted emergency and rehabilitation operations on over 130 occasions in more than 30 countries, providing assistance ranging from emergency shelter for earthquake victims in El Salvador to food aid for internally displaced persons in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, the scale of the suffering rose significantly in the aftermath of the events of 11 September, with the impact of war, social collapse and severe weather conditions taking a heavy humanitarian toll. Since 11 September 2001, Ireland Aid has delivered assistance amounting to over €11 million for the people of Afghanistan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1533">Full details of Ireland Aid emergency and rehabilitation assistance for 2001, including amounts contributed, the relief organisations involved and the geographic location of their activities, are provided in the 2001 Ireland Aid Annual Report. Copies of the report, which was published by Government in October 2002, have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_1534">In 2002, great attention has been devoted by the Government to the growing food crises in Africa. Recent assessments carried out by the United Nations World Food Programme indicate that over 14 million people in southern Africa and 12 million in the Horn of Africa region will be in need of food assistance by next May. In response to these food crises, Ireland Aid has delivered over €11.5 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance for the affected countries in southern Africa and the Horn of Africa region to date this year. In addition, on 22 October 2002, a special €1 million emergency food aid package for Ethiopia was announced by Minister of State with special responsibility for overseas development assistance, Deputy Tom Kitt.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_247">To date this year, the Government has intervened to provide emergency and rehabilitation assistance on more than 100 occasions in countries throughout Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Central and Latin America and Eastern Europe. These interventions include assistance to the victims of the Goma volcano eruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo, rehabilitation assist ance for flood victims in India, support for earthquake victims in Afghanistan, food and medical supplies for Palestine and shelter and other emergency assistance for flood victims in the Czech Republic.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_248">Key priorities for Ireland Aid in responding to emergency situations remain the protection of human lives through the provision of basic needs such as food, shelter, water and sanitation and assisting the rebuilding of lives and livelihoods through support for activities such as land mine clearance, agricultural recovery, education rehabilitation and other essential rehabilitation tasks.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_249">I note that the core of Ireland Aid's development co-operation programme remains focused on poverty reduction through sustainable development. It is only through the achievement of long-term development that the number of emergency situations, in particular food security crises, can be reduced. Nevertheless, it is imperative that we continue to respond quickly to alleviate the suffering of those worst affected by humanitarian emergencies.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1536">The international aid community, including Ireland, has been providing essential emergency relief to Afghanistan for a number of years. In October 2000 the Government gave priority to Afghanistan as a then "forgotten emergency". In 2001, Ireland Aid, the official aid programme of the Government, delivered emergency humanitarian assistance amounting to over €5 million to the people of Afghanistan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1537">The scale of the suffering in Afghanistan increased further in the aftermath of the events of 11 September, with the impact of war, social collapse and severe weather conditions taking a heavy humanitarian toll. At the International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance for Afghanistan held in Tokyo last January, I made a bilateral pledge of €12 million from the Ireland Aid programme to be delivered over a three year period. Some €5.3 million of this pledge has already been delivered to date in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1538">In addition to funding dispersed under the Tokyo pledge, a further €2.2 million in emergency humanitarian assistance has been provided in support of Afghanistan and Afghan refugees so far this year and a further US$250,000 was provided to the UNDP Law and Order Trust Fund in support of civil police capacity building. It is anticipated that the underlying humanitarian emergency occurring in Afghanistan will continue for some time and the Government stands ready to respond further as may be required.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_250">Ireland Aid support is being channelled through both Irish non-governmental organisations and international development agencies providing basic needs such as food, shelter, water and sanitation and assistance for the rebuilding of lives and livelihoods through support for activities such as agricultural recovery and education rehabilitation. Irish NGOs operating on the ground in Afghanistan include Concern, Trocáire, GOAL and Christian Aid Ireland. International agencies supported by Ireland Aid include the United Nations World Food Programme, UNICEF, International Federation of the Red Cross and the International Organisation for Migration. Funding is also delivered through the UN trust funds to provide direct support to the authorities in Afghanistan.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_251">I welcome the major contribution being made by the European Union to the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The European Commission and EU member states made substantial pledges for the reconstruction of Afghanistan at the Tokyo conference, totalling €594 million for 2002 alone. In addition, the EU has committed €240 million in emergency humanitarian assistance. The European Commission has also recently adopted a new humanitarian aid package worth over €17 million to support former refugees returning to Afghanistan from neighbouring countries as well as for internally displaced people and other vulnerable and drought affected populations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_252">The Government will continue to follow the unfolding situation in Afghanistan closely and we stand prepared to deliver further assistance.

The needs of St. Cronan's senior national school will be considered at that time. In the meantime, the school's board of management should ensure that essential health and safety issues are attended to. It should, therefore, continue to use the devolved grant for minor works and if the cost of any works of an emergency nature exceeds the amount available under the devolved grant, it may apply to my Department's building unit for supplementary grant-aid.</p>

          <p eId="para_1591">A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular: the extent of the problem; the factors which contribute to the problem; and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils. The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998.</p>

      asked the

      if his attention has been drawn to the fact that parents of children and adults with attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have needs which are not being met in education (details supplied); and his plans to help those affected by ADD and ADHD.
      [21809/02]

        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_723">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1595">It is the policy of my Department that all teachers working with children with special education needs, including children with attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity will have relevant training. In recent years, there has been a major increase in the level of additional teaching resources made available to schools to cater for children with special educational needs, including children with ADD and ADHD. These additional staffing appointments bring with them the need for additional training in all aspects of special educational provision and this is being addressed on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1596">Through the colleges of education, my Department funds a range of post-graduate and induction programmes designed to address the additional knowledge and skills that teachers may require in catering for the children in question. Local courses are also provided through the education centres network and these include courses specifically on ADD an ADHD. In addition, my Department recently provided funding for 135 teachers who participated in an e-learning summer course on ADD and ADHD. This innovative course was made available throughout the months of July and August 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1597">The existing full-time programmes of pre-service teacher training – primary – in the colleges of education contain appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special needs. Students undertaking the Bachelor of Education Degree or the Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary Teaching) in St. Patrick's and Mary Immaculate colleges of education now follow a course module on special education. This module covers the broad range of issues in special education. In the Church of Ireland and Coláiste Mhuire, Marino colleges of education, particular attention is paid to special needs and learning difficulties arising from various factors under method studies in English and mathematics. In the case of the Froebel College of Education, students have a course module under remedial work. This deals with learning difficulties arising from special needs.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_262">The general aim of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is to assist in facilitating all students to develop to their potential and to maximise the benefits of their educational experiences, having particular regard to those  having special educational needs. At present, practically all post-primary schools and approximately 1,950 national schools are served by NEPS. This number will be substantially increased by the end of the year 2002 as recently appointed psychologists are assigned to schools.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_263">In those schools served by NEPS, the educational psychologists take referrals of children suspected to have ADD or ADHD. They work in collaboration with teachers and parents and use agreed diagnostic criteria to identify children with these syndromes. In most cases, they refer such children on to clinical services for further advice, as it is usually necessary for full diagnosis and support to be provided by a multi-disciplinary team. The educational psychologists continue to provide advice to the teachers of children with ADD or ADHD on educational programmes and behavioural management.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_264">The special educational needs of children with ADD and ADHD can be addressed in special dedicated schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools, or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. Many children suffering from the conditions in question are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher and special needs assistant services. Where the level of the disorder is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 8:1 and special needs assistant support is provided where required.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_265">It is my intention to continue to build on these developments to ensure that all children, including children with attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, receive the support they require.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1604">I fully support the RAPID programme as there is undoubtedly a strong link between poor educational achievement and socio-economic deprivation. At present, the current structures of my Department are not fully convergent with the requirements for participation in the local delivery of some social inclusion and development initiatives. Unlike many other Departments and agencies, which have regional and local office structures, the traditional emphasis in policy in the Department of Education and Science has led to a rather centralised departmental structure. For this reason it was not possible to provide representation on each of the 45 RAPID area implementation teams – 25  urban and 20 provincial town areas – and this position was made clear from the outset.</p>
          <p eId="para_1605">However, following a Government decision that my Department should establish a number of regional offices, my officials, in consultation with the Department of Finance, are currently working towards the implementation of a programme of structural reform. This will help to address, among other elements, the capacity to participate in local and regional developments, such as the RAPID initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1606">While my Department, as currently structured, is not in a position at present to provide representation on each of the 45 RAPID area implementation teams, I have taken the following steps to ensure that my Department fully engages with the RAPID programme: an assistant secretary general from my Department has been nominated to participate in the work of the RAPID National Monitoring Committee; RAPID forms a standing item on the agenda of the social inclusion group, an internal committee chaired by an assistant secretary general that meets on a monthly basis; responsibility for co-ordinating the RAPID programme in my Department has been assigned to social inclusion unit which liaises with local RAPID co-ordinators and project sponsors who have queries about their projects or the type of programmes funded by my Department and this consultation process has been ongoing since the inception of the RAPID programme; and the RAPID national co-ordinator and his team of assistants have given a number of briefing sessions to relevant officials in my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_1618">The Department has a limited timescale in which to process appeals taking into account that every candidate is first given an opportunity to view their scripts before deciding to proceed with their appeal. The Department is aware of the need to process the results as early as possible while at the same time allowing examiners sufficient time to carry out a thorough re-marking of each appeal applicant's work.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_267">Our system is a world leader in terms of giving candidates an opportunity to view their scripts both before deciding whether or not to appeal, and after the re-marking process. Another comparable strength of our appeal system is that a full re-marking – as distinct from a check of mark addition – takes place. On balance we feel it is better to have a comprehensive quality appeal system that takes some time to execute rather than to prejudice quality by a less comprehensive speedier process. For this reason it is necessary to have precise arrangements for the execution of the process, and, in the interest of inter-candidate equity, to ensure that those arrangements are well publicised and are of general application.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_268">In the circumstances, it is not possible to accept late appeal applications, as to do so would be to provide a service for a particular candidate that is not available to all other candidates.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1680">A regime to limit fishing activity and access to western waters, including the Irish Box, was put in place in 1995 in order to provide for a rational and orderly exploitation of fishing grounds by all vessels, including the Spanish fleet. Ireland's legal advice is that this regime is not time barred and does not come to an end at the end of 2002. It is clear that the Commission has been of the same opinion in so far as it did not envisage an end to the western waters regime in its Green Paper on CFP reform or in the proposals for reform introduced in June 2002.</p>

          <p eId="para_1682">I am also involved in intensive series of meetings at European level to draw attention to the very serious consequences arising for fish stocks and for the Irish fishing industry if unrestricted access to the Irish Box is allowed from the beginning of next year. In the past week I have met the Portuguese Minister for Fisheries, who shares some common ground with Ireland on this issue, and the Danish Minister for Fisheries who currently holds the Presidency of the Council for Agriculture and Fisheries. I also held a bilateral meeting involving the Irish fishing industry on Monday with Commissioner Fischler, the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Fisheries. At the meeting Ireland's case that the waters within the Irish Box are very sensitive and play an important role as nursery grounds for stocks in western waters and beyond was strongly made. The need to maintain and enhance the current restrictive regime, which is fully justified on the grounds of conservation and rational exploitation of fish stocks, was strongly emphasised. I will continue in the coming weeks to work to have Ireland's position on this issue fully understood by my colleagues at Council in order that Council will be fully informed when this issue is considered by Council in the coming weeks.</p>

I would hope to be in a position in December to make an announcement on the successful applicants.

The foster carers are paid at rates agreed with the agencies. The provision of funding for Cúnamh is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, on behalf of the area boards. The ERHA is in routine contact with them on this and other matters. The ERHA currently provides an annual grant of approximately €227,000 to Cúnamh.

          <p eId="para_1700">Labelling on tobacco product packets is not regulated in the same manner as foods for human consumption which require a list of ingredients to be shown on packets and containers. Labelling on tobacco products is regulated under Directive 2001/37/EC concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products. This directive requires manufacturers and importers of tobacco products to supply to member states a list of all ingredients, and quantities thereof, used in the manufacture of those tobacco products, by brand name and type. This information must be provided on a yearly basis and for the first time by 31 December 2002 at the latest. The directive has been transposed in Irish law by the Public Health (Tobacco) Act, 2002, however, as this Act is subject to legal challenge at the moment the provisions of the directive have not yet been commenced. Nonetheless, I have written to the manufacturers and importers of tobacco products concerned requesting the required product information by 31 December 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1701">With regard to this information, member states shall ensure its dissemination, by any appropriate means, with a view to informing consumers. Many different types of ingredients and additives are used in manufacturing tobacco products and listing all of them on packaging would necessitate very small size print and might detract from the new larger, more visible health warnings now being displayed on packets of cigarettes. In addition to the new health warnings, the directive provides that the tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields of cigarettes must be printed on the external area of one side of the unit packet of cigarettes.</p>

The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed my Department that all children placed on its assessment waiting list are taken sequentially for an assessment of their priority of need for treatment. The board has further informed my Department that the average waiting time for assessment as of 30 June 2002 was 12 months.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1726">As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible patients is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. Entitlement to orthodontic treatment is determined by reference to orthodontic guidelines, a set of objective clinical criteria applied by health board orthodontists when assessing children's priority of need for treatment. The orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. The orthodontic guidelines are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for and applied equitably to the most severe cases. The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. The decision on priority of need of treatment is independently taken by the orthodontist. Consequently, the question of an orthodontic manager rescinding a decision of an orthodontist on a person's priority of need of treatment does not arise. However, the number of cases capable of being treated will depend on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff and other resources, in an area, and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list.</p>
          <p eId="para_1727">The numbers receiving orthodontic treatment are increasing. In this regard, the chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the June 2002 quarter there were 19,055 persons in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 1,760 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of cases in treatment in December 2001. I am committed to continuing to increase the number of cases in treatment further in view of the range of measures I have taken to improve service provision on a national basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1728">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service. Ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_285">This year, my Department expects to fund 11 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 11 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. This is an aggregate of eighteen public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. The training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different  clinical treatment methods and are made possible by cooperation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_286">These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_287">In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which €4.698 million was to fund an Initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_288">Last June, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1745">I share the Deputy's concern about the serious issue of substance abuse and the need to ensure that the public, particularly young people, are made aware of the scale and scope of the problems of drug and drink abuse. The Government's responses to these problems are comprehensive. Data relating to drugs possession offences and seizures are contained in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána, copies of which have been placed in the Oireachtas Library. If the Garda authorities are asked to compile statistical information which is not readily available in the annual reports, however, the  deployment of special Garda resources will be required. As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda authorities may take the view that some requests would require a disproportionate amount of time and effort to fulfil which would not be justified in the circumstances where there are continuing, and significant, overall demands on Garda resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1746">It should be noted that drug seizures may not necessarily be related to usage in that locality as the drugs may have been in transit. Garda Síochána statistics on drug possession offences are but one indicator of the use of drugs throughout the country. The drug misuse research division of the Health Research Board is responsible for operating the national drug treatment reporting system, which is the main source of information on drug misuse in Ireland. The reporting system provides data on people who avail of treatment services for problem drug abuse on a nationwide basis. This provides information on current patterns and trends and reports on such trends in the health board areas are available from the health promotion departments established within all health boards, or from the health research board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1747">The Government's national drugs strategy, which is contained in the report Building on Experience, is the most comprehensive analysis and assessment of the drugs problem ever conducted in Ireland. The strategy outlines the policy framework through which all those involved in delivering on drugs policy can work on a partnership basis over the next seven years. The national health promotion strategy is also a resource and guide for those concerned with promoting health at a national and regional level while the interim report of the strategic task force on alcohol addresses issues related to the prevention of alcohol related harm. The reports and strategy documents are available in the Oireachtas Library and may also be purchased through the Government publications sales office. The Deputy will wish to be made aware that it is proposed to launch a national drugs awareness campaign early in the new year. The purpose of the national campaign will be to highlight the dangers of drugs and to promote a greater understanding of the causes and consequences of drugs misuse.</p>

In relation to Finglas, it was intended that the system would consist of nine cameras to be monitored from Finglas Garda station.

This offer has been referred to the advisory committee, established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for CCTV systems, for consideration.

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1798">I have noted the matters raised by the Simon Communities of Ireland in its Annual Review 2001-2002, and officials of my Department have already met a representative of Simon to further discuss the issues raised in this report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1799">I assure the Deputy of the Government's continued commitment to tackling homelessness. Homelessness – An Integrated Strategy launched in May 2000 as part of the Governments Homeless Strategy, requires local authorities, together with health boards and voluntary bodies, to draw up local three year action plans to tackle homelessness. Most of these plans have now been completed and it is expected that the remaining few will be completed shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1800">A wide range of additional accommodation, ranging from emergency night shelter to long-term sheltered accommodation to enable homeless persons move out of emergency accommodation into long-term accommodation that is more suitable to their needs has already been provided and more will be provided in future years as part of the full implementation of the action plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1801">Substantial additional funding has been made available as part of the homelessness strategy. Capital funding from my Department for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from €25.4 million to €50.8 million over the period 2001-05. In addition, funding is available under the Department's capital assistance scheme to the voluntary sector for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons and a total of almost €500,000 will be paid to Simon under this scheme in 2002. Recoupment by my Department of current expenditure on homeless services by local authorities has increased significantly from €12.6 million in 1999 to an estimated €43 million this year, of which €2.8 million is payable to the Simon Communities. These increases are clear evidence of the Governments determination to address the issue of homelessness in a comprehensive and coordinated way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1802">The prevention of homelessness is also being addressed. The main aim of the homeless preventative strategy, which was launched in February 2002, is to ensure that no one is released from any type of State care without the appropriate measures in place to ensure that they have a suitable place to live with the necessary supports, if needed. This strategy was prepared by my Department in conjunction with the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Education and Science; and Health and Children under the auspices of the cross-Department team on homelessness and contains measures to prevent homelessness among adult offenders, young offenders, those leaving mental health facilities and acute hospitals, and young people leaving care.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_291">The implementation of both the integrated and preventative strategies is being monitored by the cross-Department team on homelessness with a view to identifying and addressing any obstacles to progress. I have asked that the issues raised in the Simon Annual Review be considered by the team.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_292">The Pensions (Amendment) Act, 2002, made significant improvements in the area of preservation of pension entitlement. These include, in respect of people who leave employment after 1  June 2002, vesting of pension benefit after two years, previously five; preserved benefit in respect of pre-1991 service and revaluation of that benefit. These improvements will be of considerable benefit to people qualifying for deferred pensions in the future.</summary>
